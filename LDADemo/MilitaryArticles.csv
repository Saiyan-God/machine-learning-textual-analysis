COMMANDDOCTRINES OF COMBATThe ultimate objective of all military operations isthe destruction of the enemy's armed forces in battle Theability to select objectives whose attainment contributes mostdecisively and quickly to the defeat of the hostile armed farcesis one attribute of the able commander3 Simple and direct plans and methods with prompt andthorough execution are often decisive in the attainment ofsuccess4 Unity of command obtains that unity of effort whichis essential to the decisive application of full combat powerof the available forcesUnity of effort is furthered by fullcooperation between elements of the commands5 Through offensive action a commander exercises hisinitiative preserves his freedom of action and imposes hiswill on the enemy A defensive attitude may however bedeliberately adopted as a temporary expedient while awaitingan opportunity for counteroffensive action or for the purpose of economizing forces on a front where a decision is notsought The selection by the commander of the right timeand place for offensive action is a decisive factor in thesuccess of the operationNumerical inferiority does not necessarily commit a command to a defensive attitude Superior hostile numbers maybe overcome through greater mobility better armament andequipment more effective fire higher morale and betterleadership Superior leadership often enables a numericallyinferior force to be stronger at the point of decisive actionA strategically defensive mission is frequently mast effectively executed through offensive action It is often necessary for an inferior force to strike at an early moment inorder to secure initial advantages or to prevent itself frombeing overwhelmed by a growing superiority in the hostileforces226 Concentration of superior forces both on the groundand in the air at the decisive place and time and their employment in a decisive direction creates the conditionsessential to victory Such concentration requires strict economy in the strength of forces assigned to secondary missions Detachments during combat are justifiable only whenthe execution of tasks assigned them contributes directlyto success in the main battle7 Surprise must be sought throughout the action byevery means and by every echelon of command It may beobtained by fire as well as by movementSurprise is produced through measures which either deny information tothe enemy or positively deceive him as to our dispositionsTerrain which appears to imposemovements and plansgreat difficulties on operations may often be utilized to gainsurprise Surprise is furthered by variation in the meansand methods employed in combat and by rapidity ofexecutionSurprise often compensates for numerical inferiority offorceSurprise finds the enemy in a state of mental moral orphysical unpreparedness Every effort should be made todeny him time to take effective countermeasuresThe effectof surprise may be lost through dilatory methods of execution8 To guard against surprise requires a correct estimateenemycapabilities adequate security measures effectiveofreconnaissance and readiness for action of all units Everyunit takes the necessary measures for its own local groundand air security Provision for the security of flanks andrear is of especial importanceCOMMAND9 Command is the authority which an individual in themilitary service lawfully exercises over subordinates by virtueof rank or assignmentWhether theCommand and leadership are inseparableforce is large or small whether the functions of command arecomplex or simple the commander must be the controllinghead ; his must be the master mind and from him must flowthe energy and the impulse which are to animate all underhim23		2 0- 2424- 28FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONSOPERATIONS20 Decision as to a specific course of action is the responsibility of the commander alone While he may accept advice and suggestions from any of his subordinates he aloneis responsible for what his unit does or fails to dounderstanding of the-plans and intentions of their superiorCommanders do not justify their decisions to subordinatesnor do they seek the approval of subordinates for theiractions2 A willingness to accept responsibility is the foremosttrait of leadership Every individual from the highest commander to the lowest private must always remember that inaction and neglect of opportunities will warrant more severecensure than an error of judgment in the action taken /Thecriterion by which a commander judges the soundness of hisown decision is whether it will further the intentions of thehigher commander / Willingness to accept responsibility mustnot manifest itself in a disregard of orders on the basis of amere probability of having a better knowledge of the situationthan the higher commander The subordinate unit is a partof a tactical team employed by the higher commander toaccomplish a certain mission and any independence on thepart of a subordinate commander must conform to the generalplan for the unit as a whole 25 All the troops assigned to the execution of a distinct22 The commander's mission is contained in the orderswhich he has received Nevertheless a commander of asubordinate unit cannot plead absence of orders or the nonreceipt of orders as an excuse for inactivity in a situationwhere action on his part is essential or where a change inthe situation upon which the issued orders were based renderssuch orders impracticable or impossible of execution If thesituation does not permit communication with the superiorcommander and the subordinate commander is familiar withthe general plan of operations or the mission of the wholecommand he should take appropriate action and report thesituation as early as practicableESTIMATE Of THE SITUATION23 The situations that confront a commander in war areof infinite variety In spite off the most careful planning andanticipation unexpected obstacles frictions and mistakes arecommon occurrences in battle A commander must schoolhimself to regard these events as cgmmonplace and not permitthem to frustrate him in the accomplishment of his mission 24 Personal conferences between the higher commanderand his subordinates who are to execute his orders may attimes be advisable that the latter may arrive at a correct24mission should be placed under one command to function asa task force for the duration of the operation So long as acommander can exercise effective command he does not disturb the established chain of command in his force In somesituations conditions dictate that attachments must be madeto subordinate commands Such attachments may be necessary in marches during periods of development in rapidlychanging situations or in the later stages of any action andin general when better support or coordination can beeffected26 A commander who is advanced to a higher commandshould be relieved from the responsibilitydirect commandofof his former unit27 In any tactical operation the commander mustquickly evaluate all the available information bearing on histask estimate the situation and reach a decision 28 The commander's estimate of the situation is based onIthe mission of the unit the means available to him and to theenemy the conditions in his area of operations includingterrain and weather and the probable effects of various linesof action on future operations (See FM 0 -5 ) On the basisof these factors he considers the lines of action open to himwhich if successful will accomplish his mission and thelines of action of which the enemy is physically capable andwhich can interfere with such accomplishment He analyzesthe opposing lines of action one against another to arrive atconclusions as to the probability of success for each of hisown lines of action On the basis of this analysis he then considers the relative advantages and disadvantages of his ownlines of action and selects that line of action which mostpromises success regardless of what the enemy may do Iftwo or more lines of action appear equally promising hechooses that one which will most favor future action25		29- 33OPERATIONSFIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS 29 The estimate often requires rapid thinking with consideration limited to essential factorsIn campaign exactconclusions concerning the enemy can seldom be drawnTo delay action in an emergency because of insufficient information shows a lack of energetic leadership and mayThe commander must takeresult in lost opportunitiescalculated risks 30 In considering the enemy's possible lines of actionthe commander must guard against the unwarranted beliefthat he has discovered the enemy's intentions and againstignoring other lines of action open to the enemy Even whenthe weight of evidence warrants the belief that the enemyis committed to a definite line of action the commandermust bear in mind that a change in the enemy's plans mayoccur at any time3 Because of their great mobility and rapid strikingpower the capabilities of the opposing air and armoredforces and the possible effect of their employment must becontinually evaluatedIn estimating the capabilities of airarmored and motorized forces both friendly and hostilethe commander must be provided with full and up-to-dateinformation on the existing and probable future weatherconditions and their effect both ground and air on employment of such forces32 The estimate of the situation culminates in the decision A decision once made Is not changed without somecompelling reason In combat the will and energy of thecommander must persist until the mission is accomplishedEstimation of the situation is however a continuous processand changed conditions may at any time call for a newdecision Too stubborn an adherence to a previous decisionmay result in costly delay loss of opportunity for decisiveaction or outright failureTERRAIN 33 That part of the commander's estimate dealing withterrain often exercises a decisive influence upon his decisionand plan Proper evaluation and utilization of the terrainreduce the disadvantage of incomplete information of theenemy The more important features to be considered inevaluating terrain include not only natural ground formssuch as mountains ridges streams bodies of water woods2633- 36and open spaces but also artificial features such as roadsrailroads and towns The commander seeks always toutilize the terrain to his own advantage and to the enemy'sdisadvantage34 While the mission of a force is the basic factor in thecommander's estimate this may frequently be resolved intoterms of terrain Thus in the defense it may be vital tohold certain dominating ground or to protect a certain defileSimilarly in the offense success may hinge on the captureof such features which then become the immediate objectiveof the attack Where possible it is an aid to proper evaluation of the terrain to reduce the mission to terms of terrain35 Maps are the basis for terrain studies but should bechecked by air reconnaissance 'air photographs and groundreconnaissance Map errors must be expected Moreoverchanges in the terrain especially in the road-net and drainage system occur continually 36 Terrain can always be evaluated in terms of the following five factors : observation fields of fire concealmentand cover obstacles and routes of communicationa Observation of the battlefield is essential in order tobring effective fire to bear upon the enemy to control themaneuver of one's own troops and to prevent surprise by theenemy It is obtained from commanding elevationsb Fields of fire are essential to the defense On the offensive the commander seeks to make his main attack in areaslacking in good fields of fire to the defender Best fields offire are found in level or uniformly sloping streches of opengroundc Concealment and cover may occur together Concealment is protection against observation from the ground andair Cover is protection against fire The ideal defensiveposition is one having concealment and cover within but nonein front of it The attack is best favored by terrain affordinggood concealment throughout the depth of the advanceConcealment and cover from ground weapons are to befound in broken wooded terraind Obstacles are terrain features which impede the movement of military forcesThey are of increasing importancein modern warfare where masses of mechanized units are employed Although chiefly of advantage to the defense they3 6266 0-4 -327			36- 37OPERATIONSFIELD SERVICE REGULATIONSmay be of great importance in protecting the flanks of attacking units Some of the common terrain obstacles aremountains rivers bodies of water marshes gullies steep inclines and extensive woodse Routes of communication include roads railrogds waterways and airways and their facilitiesThey are importantin both offensive and defensive operations for the movementof troops and supplies Troops in small bodies move acrosscountry readily but in the operations of large bodies of troopsroutes of communication are of vital importance0 -5 for a detailed discussion of terrainCONDUCT IN BATTLE39 The commander's decision for his unit as a whole andthe missions to subordinate units in support of the decisionare communicated to subordinates by clear and concise orders which gives them freedom of action appropriate to theirprofessional knowledge to the situation to their dependabilityand to the teamplay desired40 After providing for the issuance of orders the commander places himself where he can best control the courseof action and exert his leadership His command post affordsthe advantage of established signal communication Whenopportunity offers and when his presence at the command postis not urgently required he visits his subordinate commandersand his troops in order to inspire confidence and to assurehimself that his orders are understood and properly executed5 37 Features such as bridges streams woods and townsdivide practically all terrain into more or less separate areasSuch an area frequently consists of a valley lying betweentwo ridges or an open space between two woods When theterrain features enclosing the area prevent direct fire andobservation into it from positions outside the area is called acompartment4 Whenever the commander leaves his command posthe should orient his staff as to further plans to be made ormeasures to be taken in anticipation of future contingenciesand should inform his staff where he can be reachedA compartment of which the longer axis extends in the direction of movement of a force or leads toward or into adefensive position is called a corridor In - general a corridor favors the attack because it limits observation and directfire from the flanks by the defender From the standpoint ofterrain it is desirable that boundaries between tactical unitsin the attack should coincide generally with the boundariesof corridors in order that a single unit may control the terrain features from which direct fire can be brought to bear ontroops within the corridorIn the defense boundaries are usually located within corridors To assure unity of defensive dispositions the boundarywithin the corridor should be so located as to include withinthe sector of a tactical unit of appropriate size avenues ofapproach to the position To locate boundaries within anavenue of approach divides responsibility at critical areasA compartment which extends across the direction ofmovement of a force or which extends parallel with a defensive front is called a cross-corridor Cross-corridors favorthe defense However ridge lines perpendicular to the direction of advance permit an attacker to deal successively withelements of the hostile position During the advance thesecrests offer the attacker facilities for observation and fire aswell as shelter behind which he may reorganize his units2838 See FM38- 4442 During the decisive phase of battle the place of thecommander is near the critical point of action43 A commander influences the course of subsequentaction by his leadership by the use of his reserves by theconcentration of artillery and other supporting fires and bythe employment of combat aviation and armored unitsi44 The duration of a tactical operation can seldom bepredictedSuccessful engagements sometimes progress soslowly that the gains made are not immediately apparentAt other times they progress so fast that the gains made canbe capitalized only by the most aggressive and farsightedleadershipTroops are used up rapidly in the decisive phases of combat This attrition must be anticipated by the commanderand his staff who take timely measures for replacement ofmen units transport and weapons and for replenishmentof ammunition and other supplies When the situation permits troops which have been heavily engaged are rested andreorganized before being assigned a new and importantmission29			45- 50OPERATIONSFIELD SERVICE REGULATIONSSTAFF2 45 The staff assists the commander to the extent thathe may require by providing information data and advice ;by preparing detailed plans and orders in accordance withhis directions ; and by exercising such supervision over theexecution of his orders as he may prescribeA staff officeras such does not exercise command46 The staff may be divided into two groups-the generalstaff and the special staffIn large units these two staffgroups are separate and distinct ; In smaller units they mergeinto each other and one staff officer frequently is chargedwith duties pertaining to both staff groups47 In every headquarters there is a constant tendency tomultiply personnel expand the functions of staff administration and accumulate records and office equipmentThecommander must avoid this expansionHe must organizehis headquarters so as to maintain its readiness for promptmovementi 48 The organization functions and duties of the varioussections of the staff and the employment and duties of liaisonofficers are prescribed in FM 0 -5COMBAT ORDERS49 The authority to issue orders is an inherent functionof commandOrders are normally issued to next subordinate commanders Bypassing the normal channels of command is resorted to only in urgent situations ; in such casesboth the commander issuing and the commander receivingthe order should notify intermediate commanders of itspurport as soon as possible50- 54units prescribing the' part each is to play in the operation orin the separate phases thereof This procedure will be usualin divisions and smaller units Fragmentary orders may beeither oral or writtenThey are concise but not at theexpense of clarity and omission of essential informationInstructions issued in fragmentary orders may be repeated ina complete field order or in an annex if considered desirable9 5 Orders should be originated sufficiently early andtransmitted in such form as to permit subordinate commanders the maximum periods to reconnoiter to estimatetheir own situations to issue their orders and to preparetheir troops for the contemplated operationCommandersshould be alert to forestall delays in the successive dissemination of orders in their lower echelons52 In many situations it may be necessary or desirableto issue an order to warn of impending operations (warningorders)A warning order contains information which enables subordinate commanders to make preparations for acontemplated operationIts principal purpose is to gaintime for preparatory measures and to conserve the energyof the troops53 An order should not trespass upon the province of asubordinateIt should contain everything that the subordinate must know to carry out his mission but nothing moreThe order is complete when it covers all essential aspectsComplete orders include misand phases of the operationsubordinateunitschargedwith the execution ofsions to allincarryingoutthecommander's plantactical operationsFragmentary orders are used when speed in delivery andexecution is imperative Fragmentary orders are issued successively as the situation develops and decisions are madeand consist of separate instructions to one or more subordinate54 Orders must be clear and explicit and as brief as isconsistent with clarity ; short sentences are easily understoodClarity is more important than technique The more urgentthe situation the greater the need for conciseness in theorder Any statement of reasons for measures adoptedshould be limited to what is necessary to obtain intelligentcooperation from subordinates Detailed instructions for avariety of contingencies or prescriptions that are a matterof training do not inspire confidence and have no place in anorder Trivial and meaningless expressions divide responsibility and lead to the adoption of half measures by subordinates Exaggerated and bombastic phrases invite ridiculeand weaken the force of an order Expressions such as""attack vigorously "" if used in orders are not only verboseand meaningless but tend to weaken the force of subsequentorders in which such expressions do not appear303 50 Orders may be either complete or fragmentary		55- 58FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS 55 Orders should prescribe only so far as conditions canbe foreseen Orders which attempt to regulate matters toofar in the future result in frequent changes Frequentchanges in orders overload the means of signal communication cause confusion and misunderstanding impose need'less hardships on the troops and injure their moraleOrders issued by subordinates should not be mere repetition of those from higher authority with additions of theirown New orders are clearer and more satisfactory 56 As a rule it is desirable to keep contemplated operations secret as long as possible and to confine knowledgethereof to a few staff officers and senior commanders However upon entry into' action no unit should be in doubt asto what the commander wants it to do Whenever knowledgeof his intentions is necessary to insure the cooperation of theunits engaged a commander does not hesitate to disclose themto all concerned Ignorance of his intentions may oftenlead to inactivity on the part of subordinates 57 It is impossible to prescribe detailed forms of ordersto fit every tactical situation To attempt to do so wouldresult in a rigid form and a routine style of expression whichwould not be in accord with the tactical requirements presented by the diverse situations that arise in war To theextent practicable however it has been found efficient andconvenient to clA-csify combat orders according to their purpose and scope and for some of these to adopt a standardsequence of composition This makes for ease of understanding the avoidance of omissions and ready referenceMoreover experience has shown that an order which canbe misunderstood will be misunderstood and that to obviatethis danger it is necessary to follow certain rules relating tothe designations of boundaries details of time and placemilitary terminology abbreviations designations of units andthe like For details relating to these matters see FM 0 -5fI 58 Annexes may be issued to accompany combat orderseither for brevity clarity or simplicityfor example mapsoverlays photographs and sketches-or to amplify particularaspects of the operation if the volume of detail is too greatfor inclusion in the order itself The more mobile the operation the less opportunity there will be for annexes Wherean annex has limited distribution certain instructions32OPERATIONS58- 62contained therein must be repeated in order to insurecoordination 59 In every unit standing operating procedure is prescribed by the commander whenever practicable This procedure covers those features of operations which lend themselves to a definite or standardized procedure without loss ofeffectiveness The adoption of such procedures will save timein the preparation and issuance of orders minimize thechances for confusion and errors when under stress of combat and greatly simplify and expedite the execution of operations in the field (See FM 0 -5 )COMMAND POSTS60 For conveni",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LIGHT TANK M3 SERIES
LIGHT TANK, M3, standardized in
July, 1940, and produced in quantity beginning
in March, 19-11, was supplied to
our Allies, under Lend-Lease, as well as to
our own Army through 1941 and 1942 .
Nicknamed the ""General Stuart"" by
British troops, these tanks won high
praise during the Libyan campaign, and
are now considered obsolete only because
of the great improvements in later vehicles .
Based on Light Tank, M2A4, but using
heavier armor and incorporating other improvements,
Light Tank, M3, for its day,
was heavily armed and armored and provided
a high standard of mechanical
reliability .
Through the production period, numerous
improvements were made, so that the
final M3s were vastly different from the
first . First models were entirely riveted,
with a seven-sided turret . Later a welded,
seven-sided turret was used, and still
later, a rounded, welded, homogeneous
turret. The final models were entirely
welded .
The volute spring suspension is used,
with the rear idler ""trailing"" on ground
level, rather than ""mounted"" above the
ground as on Light Tank, M2A4 . This
lengthens the ground contact of the track,
thus decreasing the pressure per square
inch, and gives additional support to the
rear of the tank .
Power is supplied by a 7-cylinder Continental
W670-9A gasoline engine . Some
models of Light Tanks, M3 and M3A1,
were powered by a Guiberson T1020-4
Diesel engine . A synchromesh transmission
provides five forward speeds and one
reverse.
The driver and assistant driver occupy
seats in the hull, with vision ahead through
hatches equipped with windshields . In
combat areas, the armored hatch cover
may be closed, whereupon vision is possible
through a protectoscope, a form of
periscope.
The gunner and commander-loader occupy
seats in the turret, which may be
traversed through 360Â° by a hand-operated
mechanism. Entrance to the turret is
through the cupola hatch, which also provides
an observation post for the commander.
In noncombat areas, the commander
may operate with his head and

shoulders above the cupola. In danger
zones, vision from the cupola is through
pistol ports equipped with protectoscopes.
(Early models used direct vision ""peepholes""
instead .)
Principal armament is a 37 mm gun,
M5 or M6, mounted with a cal. .30
machine gun in a combination mount in
the turret. The turret guns have elevations
from -10 Â° to +20Â°. An A.P.C. projectile,
fired from the 37 mm gun, has a
muzzle velocity of 2,900 feet per second .
It has a maximum range of 12,850 yards,
and will penetrate 1 .8-inch face-hardened
armor plate at 1,000 yards .
Late models are provided with a gyrostabilizer
to increase the accuracy of aiming
and firing the turret guns when the
vehicle is in motion.
Other armament includes a cal . .30
machine gun, in the bow, one on the turret
for antiaircraft use, and -one in each
sponson.
Normal fuel capacity of 56 gallons may
be increased when necessary by the use of
two 25-gallon jettison fuel tanks. These
can be abandoned upon entering a combat
zone . The vehicle is equipped with a
two-way radio .
Light Tanks, M3 and M3 (Diesel),
were declared obsolete by Ordnance Committee
action in July, 1943. These and
later vehicles of the Light Tank, M3,
Series, were built by the American Car
and Foundry Co.
LIGHT TANK, M3AI, was standardized
in August, 1941, as a modification of
Light Tank, M3 . It was declared obsolete
in July 1944 .
The turret is similar to that used in the
final version of Light Tank, M3, but omits
the cupola. A fighting compartment is integrated
with the turret and is rotated
with it, either by a hydraulic mechanism
or by hand . This compartment contains
seats for the gunner and commanderloader
as well as the traversing and gyrostabilizer
mechanisms and ammunition .
An improved Combination Gun Mount,
M23, for the turret guns has a periscopic
sight. An additional periscope, with 360 Â°
traverse, is provided in the turret roof .
Other armament is the same as on Light
Tank, M3, except that the sponson guns
are omitted.
The vehicle is equipped with an improved
radio and with an interphone

LIGHT TANKS M5 LIMITED STANDARD-MSAI SUBSTITUTE STANDARD
LIGHT TANK, M5, standardized in
February, 1942, was designed as a modification
of Light Tank, M3A 1, to use twin
Cadillac engines and Hydra-Matic transmissions,
providing automatic gear shifting.
It was reclassified as Limited Standard
in April, 1943.
The hull is fabricated of welded, homogeneous
armor plate with the reinforced
front plate, extended sponsons, and
streamlined effect subsequently adopted
for Light Tank, M3A3 . Elimination of
bolts and rivets reduced the danger of
having these parts driven inside the tank
by the impact of projectiles on the exterior .
The welded, power-operated turret and
integrated turret basket are similar to
those used on Light Tank, M3AI. However,
because of the lower driveshaft tunnel
required by the use of the Cadillac
engines and Hydra-Matic transmissions,
it was possible to relocate the turrettraversing
mechanism and portions of the
gun stabilizer under the turret basket,
thus providing more space in the fighting
compartment.
The turret, of welded, curved-plate
armor plate, is covered on the front by a

heavy armor-plate casting which serves as
a base for the combination gun mount .
The turret can be rotated through a
traverse of 360 Â° either by a hydraulic
mechanism or by hand.
Principal armament is a 37 mm Gun,
M6, mounted with a cal. .30 Browning
machine gun, in the turret. Elevation is
from -10Â° to +20Â° . An A.P.C. projectile,
when fired from the 37 mm gun, has a
muzzle velocity of 2,900 feet per second .
It has a maximum range of 12,850 yards,
and will penetrate 1.8 inches of facehardened
armor plate at 1,000 yards .
A gyrostabilizer is provided to keep the
turret gun sufficiently close to a fixed
elevation while the tank is in motion over
normal terrain so that the gunner can
accurately aim and fire the gun.
The two 8-cylinder, 90Â°, V-type, liquidcooled
Cadillac engines are located in the
rear of the hull . The flywheel end of each
engine is connected to a Hydra-Matic
transmission . These transmissions, plus a
two-speed stepdown in the transfer unit,
provide six forward speeds and one
reverse speed.
An auxiliary power plant consisting of
a generating set powered by a singlecylinder
gasoline engine supplements the
engine generators for charging the battery .
Seats for the driver and assistant driver
are adjustable horizontally or vertically .
Seats go up under spring pressure and

down under body weight and can be
locked in any position .
The vehicle is provided with dual controls
and has four escape hatches, one for
each member of the crew. It is equipped
with 360Â° periscopes for the driver, assistant
driver, and commander and a periscopic
gun sight, as well as with three
protectoscopes in the turret ports . Two
knockout plugs cover ports in the front
armor plate . The tank is wired for radio
and for an interphone system .

LIGHT TANK, MSAI, was standardized
in September, 1942, and replaced
Light Tank, M5, in production. It was
reclassified as Substitute Standard in
July, 1944.
Principal change was in the use of an
improved turret with a radio bulge at the
rear,, similar to the turret of Light Tank,
M3A3. The improved turret provides
more room for turret crew members and
permits desirable rearrangements in stowage.
A radio antenna bracket is mounted
above the bulge . A removable plate in the
rear of the bulge permits removal of the
37 mm gun.
The antiaircraft gun mount is improved
,,MANUAL CONH OL CRAN!< :

and repositioned to the right side of the
turret. Dual traverse is incorporated, permitting
the commander to traverse the
turret while firing the antiaircraft gun .
Larger escape hatches, with improved
positive water-sealing door latches, are
provided, and there is an additional
escape hatch for emergency use in the
floor of the hull .
The improved Combination Gun
Mount, M44, for the turret guns, incorporates
a direct-sighting 3-power telescope.
The breech guard permits hinging
upward, facilitating travel from one seat
to another by personnel. A new mount for
the commander's periscope permits 360Â°
traverse . An additional periscope in the
turret facilitates rear vision for the commander.
Pistol port doors are redesigned and
relocated, and equipped with locking
devices . A direction finder fastened to the
turret roof ahead of the commander's
periscope indicates the straight ahead
position . A spotlight is provided .
Sand shields, which extend down from
the sponsons and cover the top portion of
the track, are supplied when required .
Pilot models for Light Tanks, M5 and
M5A1, were manufactured by the Cadillac
Motor Car Division, General Motors Corp .

MEDIUM TANK M3 SERIES
These were the first Auterican inediunt
tanks produced in quantity under the
defense program prior to the entry of I lie.
United States into World War II . Supplied
to the British and Russians as Lend- Lease
materiel, they compared favorably with
other medium tanks at that time.
They were the first of our tanks to
employ 75--mm guns, gyrostabilizers, and
power-traversed turrets with integral fighting
compartments. Their armor was
thicker than that of our earlier tanks .
Battle experience in Africa and Russia
suggested improvements, some of which
were introduced as production continued .
Most of the improvements, however, were
incorporated in the design of Medium
Tank M4. When the latter was standardized
in October 1941, tanks of the M3
series were designated Substitute Standard.
In April 1943 they were reclassified
as Limited Standard, and in April 1944
they were declared obsolete .
MEDIUM TANK M3-This was the
original vehicle of the series. It had a
riveted hull and was powered by a Continental
(Wright) R-975-EC2 or R-975-
C1 gasoline engine .
MEDIUM TANK M3A7-This was similar
to Medium Tank M3 but had a cast
hull .
MEDIUM TANK M3A2-This was similar
to Medium Tank M3 but had a welded
hull .
MEDIUM TANK M3A3-This was similar
to Medium Tank M3A2, with a welded
hull, but was powered by twin General
Motors 6-71 Diesel engines .
MEDIUM TANK M3A4-This was similar
to Medium Tank M3, with a riveted
hull, but was powered by a Chrysler
multibank engine .
MEDIUM TANK WAS-This was similar
to Medium Tank M3, with a riveted
hull, but was powered by twin General
Motors 6-71 Diesel engines .
Principal armament was a 75-mm Gun
M3, in a rotor mount in the right front
of the crew compartment. This gun had
an elevation from -9Â° to +20Â° and could
be traversed 15 Â° in each direction . The
gun could be fired manually or electrically .
The A.P.C. projectile M61, fired from
this gun with a muzzle velocity of 1,920
feet per second, has a maximum range of
13,090 yards and will penetrate 2 .9 inches
of face-hardened armor plate at 1,000
yards.
A 37-mm Gun M6 and a Cal . .30 Machine
Gun M1919A4 were mounted in a
Combination Gun Mount M24, in the
turret, which had a traverse of 360 Â° . The
turret guns were fired electrically and
had elevations from -7Â° to +60Â°. The

"By 26 May 1944 all plans and preparations were completed for the Division tocarry out the mission assigned it by First United States Army. Field andadministrative orders had been published and distributed. In a series of mapmaneuvres on a special 1/5,000 map regimental and battalion commandershad outlined their plans in order that all commanders might be briefedthoroughly on the prospective Division operations. Divisional seaborneechelons already had departed for the marshalling yards and were assembledin camps scattered along the Welsh and southern English coasts. The Divisionmission was to be as follows:âLand by parachute and glider before and after dawn of D-Day west of ST.SAUVEUR LE VICOMTE: seize, clear and secure the general area ST. JACQUESDE NEHOU (136985) â BESNEVILLE (137928) (both inclusive) â ST. SAUVEURLE VICOMTE (exclusive) â BLANDAMOUR (167982) (Inclusive), andreorganize; seize and destroy the crossings of the PRAIRIES MARECAGEUSESnorth of LA SANGSURIERE (188898), at ST. SAUVEUR DE PIERRE PONT(145890); destroy the crossings of the OLLONONDE River in the vicinity of ST.LO DâOURVILLE (090894) and block crossroads vicinity LE CHEMIN (102902);prevent enemy forces moving north between ST. LO DâOURVILLE and junctionof DOUVE River with PRAIRIE MARECAGEUSES (228921); and protect thesouth flank of VII Corps north of the same line.âThe mission, however, was changed by the First Army Commander on 26 Maydue to confirmed intelligence reports the enemy had strengthened his forceson the COTENIN, (CHERBOURG) Peninsula with the addition of the 91stInfantry Division in the general area of ST. SAUVEUR LE VICOMTE. Therevised mission of the 82d Airborne Division was to be:âLand by parachute and glider before and after dawn of D-Day astride theMERDERET River, seize, clear and secure the general area: CR (261938) â CR(265958) â CR (269975) â RJ (274982) â RJ (283992) â Bridge (308987) âNEUVILLE AU PLAIN (340985) â BANDIENVILLE (360987) within its zone;capture ST. MERE EGLISE (349965); seize and secure the crossings of theMERDERET River at (315957) and (321930), and a bridgehead covering them,with MLR along the general line: CR (261938) â CR (265953) â CR (269975) âRJ (274982) â RJ (283992); seize and destroy the crossing of the DOUVERiver at BEUZEVILLE LA BASTILLE (309911) and ETIENVILLE (also known asPONT LâABBE) (269927); protect the northwest flank of VII Corps within theDivision zone; and be prepared to advance west on Corps order to the line ofthe DOUVE north of its junction with the PRAIRIES MARECAGEUSES.âNew orders and other administrative details made necessary by the newmission were worked out quickly and disseminated within four days. Thechange did not effect the basic plan for movement in three echelons whichhad been worked out as follows:Force âAâ â commanded by Brigadier General JAMES M. GAVIN, assistantDivision Commander, to be committed by parachute before dawn of D-Dayand to include.Force âCâ â Commanded by Brigadier General GEORGE P. HOWELL,Commanding General of 2d Airborne Infantry Brigade to be committed by sea,to land between D plus 2 and D plus 7 and to include.Â Corps Med Dets1stPlat, 603 QM (GR) Co, atchdSeaborne elements of units in ForcesâAâ and âBâUnder the plan Force âAâ in its entirety was to approach the CHERBOURG(COTENTIN) Peninsula from the west and to drop between 0100 and 0315hours on the night of D-1/D-Day on three drop zones. The 505th ParachuteInfantry Regiment and its attachments were to land east of the MERDERETRiver about 1,000 yards northwest of STE. MERE EGLISE (3397). The 507thParachute Infantry Regiment was to land west of the MERDERET River about1,000 yards north of AMFREVILLE (3098). The 508th Parachute InfantryRegiment and Force âAâ Headquarters were to land west of the MERDERETRiver about 1,000 yards north of PICAUVILLE (2995).Fifty-two gliders of Force âBâ were to approach the CHERBOURG Peninsulafrom the west prior to H-Hour and land on the 505th drop zone. Theremainder of Force âBâ was to approach the peninsula from the east and wasto land late on D-Day and early on D plus one on landing zones astride theSTE. MERE EGLISE â BLOSVILLE Road (3694). In a last-minute change ofplan General RIDGEWAY parachuted with Force âAâ.Aerial resupply missions were scheduled automatically for the morning of Dplus one and on call thereafter if needed. The automatic mission was the onlyparachute mission ultimately flown but a small amount of equipment andsupplies were received later by glider.All airborne elements of the Division had closed and were sealed in specialcamps at the take-off fields by 24 hours before the scheduled take-off time.Parachute elements were located at seven airfields in the GRANTHAM âCOTTESMORE â LANGAR area of the British Midlands, and glider elementswere at seven airfields in the ALDERMASTON â RAMSBURY â MERRYFIELDarea. (See Annex No. 3A)All men were briefed thoroughly on their missions, a recheck was made of allequipment and personnel, and planes and gliders were loaded withequipment. The Allied D-Day was postponed 24 hours because of weatherconditions, and the first planes of Force âAâ took off at 052315 June 1944.The main flight was preceded by the three regimental pathfinder teams whichdropped one-half hour prior to the first group. The pathfinders sustainedmany casualties and had difficulty in using lights, but they accomplished theirmis- sion and set up beacons to guide the incoming planes to the threedesignated drop zones.The flight over the English Channel was in good formation and without in-cident, but between the west coast and the drop zones a heavy fog banktended to break up the formation of the planes. Flak and some enemy nightfighters activity caused some of the troop carrier planes to take up evasiveaction, and by the time the drop zones were reached many planes werescattered, and were flying at excessive speeds and at altitudes higher thenthose ideal for jumping.The 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment landed generally in the vicinity of itsdrop zone. The 507th Parachute Infantry was scattered, one elementdropping in the vicinity of MONTEBOURG, another south of CARENTAN andthe reminder astride the MERDERET River east of the drop zone. The 508thParachute Infantry Regiment was likewise scattered widely, the bulk of itsparachutists dropping east of the Drop Zone and some personnel landing asfar away as nine kilometres south of CHERBOURG.The 52 gliders containing batteries of the 80th Airborne Antiaircraft Battalionand detachments and forward parties of artillery, signel and DivisionHeadquarters groups followed the main body of paratroopers and beganlanding at 0404 hours. The gliders also encountered fog and flak. They toowere scattered, and many of them were damaged upon crashing into thesmall fields and high hedgerows.Enemy reaction to the landing of the 82d Airborne Division in the NORMANDYarea was prompt and severe, but from the time the first member landed until35 days later, when the Division was finally relieved, every mission wasaccomplished and no ground gained was ever relinquished.A day-by-day account of the Division activities follows:D-DAY, 6 JUNE 1944The first element of the main body of the Division jumped at 0151 hours,having been preceded 30 minutes by Pathfinder teams. By 0312 hours allparatroopers had landed, and at 0404 hours the first of 52 gliders in the initialglider serial crash landed. Both parachutists and gliders were scattered.Small groups and some units attacked to secure the Division zone. Groups ofmen and individuals who had been scattered in the landings rejoined theirunits throughout the day, and by nightfall approximately 30 per cent of theDivisionâs forces were under control.At 2100 hours 100 gliders landed with artillery, engineers, and special troops.Seaborne elements set sail at 0645 from BRISTOL except for a task forceconsisting of Company C, 746th Tank Battalion; the 1st Platoon, Troop B, 4thCavalry Squadron; and elements company F, 3d Battalion (originally 2dBattalion, 401st Glider Infantry), 325th Glider Infantry. This task force landedon Utah Red Beach at 1400 hours and proceeded inland with the mission ofcontacting the Division near STE. MERE EGLISE.At the close of the day, the Division was in the midst of severe fighting. It hadcaptured STE. MERE EGLISE and held a general line along the MERDERETRiver from LA FIERE (319963) south to include the eastern end of thecauseway over the MERDERET River at 321930.Headquarters &amp; Headquarters Company, 82d Airborne DivisionParachute elements, part of Force âAâ, dropped at 0214 hours near the westbank of the MERDERET River, and glider elements, leading echelon if ForceâBâ, landed at 0204 hours. The Force âAâ Command Post was set up initiallyat 305965, west of the MERDERET River, but at 0730 the group waded acrossthe River to the east bank and assembled at LA FIERE (319963). A new ForceâAâ Command Post was established at a railroad crossing at 326944.The Division Commander, who jumped with the 505th Parachute Infantry,estab- lished his Command Post in a hedgerow west of STE. MERE EGLISE at332965. Elements of Headquarters and of the Defense Platoon moved southto secure the bridge west of CHEF DU PONT (321930) where it encounteredsevere enemy fire. This group returned to the Command Post at 1700, butpart of the Defense Platoon moved to a new Force âAâ Command Post at arailroad pass at 323960.The Division Headquarters initial glider serial, which landed in the dark atapproximately 0415 hours, was scattered, and the G-2 and G-3 did not reachthe command post until late afternoon. The Chief of Staff was injured in aglider crash and later evacuated. The G-1 did not reach the command post fortwo days.505th Parachute Infantry RegimentThe first element, the 2d Battalion, dropped at 0151 hours and the entireregiment landed by 0202 hours. Most of the troops landed on or near thedrop zone, but a few were widely dispersed over the countryside. Assemblywas rapid, and the battalions moved off towards their objectives. The 3dBattalion entered STE. MERE EGLISE at 0400 hours, and the town wassecurely held and outposted within an hour. The American Flag was raisedover STE. MERE EGLISE, the first French town to be liberated by the Allies.After assembling the 2d Battalion started to move out to take NEUVILLE AUPLAIN, but orders were received from the regiment to stand by. At 0600hours the 2d Battalion moved into position north of STE. MERE EGLISE andassisted the 3d Battalion in holding the town. The 1st Battalion movedTowards its objective, the bridge over the MERDERET River (314956) at LAFIERE at 0630 hours and by 0830 held the eastern end of the bridge againstheavy enemy fire from the western approaches.507th Parachute Infantry RegimentThe first elements, the 1st Battalion, jumped at 0232 hours, and by 0312hours the entire regiment was on the ground generally east of the MERDERETRiver and was fairly dispersed. Small groups assembled to form small taskforces until such time as the regiment could assemble completely. One suchforce on the west bank of the MERDERET River attacked AMFREVILLE but wasforced back by overwhelming superiority in enemy strength to FLAUK(303955). A patrol was sent to the western end of LA FIERE Bridge andcontact was made with elements of the 505th Parachute Infantry on theeastern end at 1430 hours. The enemy recaptured FLAUK and drove thispatrol from the western end of the LA FIERE Bridge. Another force of theregiment joined with Force âAâ Headquarters and at 1130 attacked to securethe CHEF DU PONT Bridge (321930), meeting extremely severe resistance.The eastern end of the bridge was finally secured by nightfall. Leaving onecompany to hold the bridge, the remainder of this second force moved to anassembly area at 1715 hours in the vicinity of the railroad overpass at323960. Still another group, led by the regimental commander, landed on ornear the scheduled drop zone but had no contact with other elements of theDivision during the day.508th Parachute Infantry RegimentThe 3d Battalion jumped at 0208 hours and the entire regiment was on theground by 0220 hours. Four separate groups were assembled. One group wasin the vicinity of LA FIERE, fought along the railway and attacked the LAFIERE Bridge. This group was later relieved by the 1st Battalion, 505thParachute Infantry and moved to an assembly area in the vicinity of therailroad overpass (323960) to organize a defensive position. Two other groupsjoined forces west of the MERDERET River in the vicinity of PICAUVILLE aftertaking part in heavy fighting around GUETTEVILLE (300948) and north ofPICAUVILLE. An officer of this group shot and killed the commanding generalof the German 91st Division. The combined group then seized the highground west of the MERDERET River south of GUETTEVILLE at 310940 duringthe night of June 6-7. A fourth group dropped in the vicinity of STE. MEREEGLISE, fought with the 507th Parachute Infantry to take the CHEF DU PONTBridge (321930) and later organized a defensive position covering the bridge.325th Glider Infantry RegimentCompany F, 3d Battalion, supporting Company C, 746th Tank Battalion,landed on Utah Red Beach at 1400, de-waterproofed vehicles and movedinland at 1600 to make contact with the Division. Heavy artillery, mortar andsmall arms fire held up this task force at crossroads 363933. Two tanks wereknocked out. The remainder of the regiment prepared to take off fromairports in England.82d Airborne Division ArtilleryParachute elements jumped at 0210 hours, joined a group from the 508thParachute Infantry and assisted in the attack on the LA FIERE Bridge. At 1330hours this element joined the glider element at the Division CP at 332965.Glider elements landed at 0500 hours and moved directly to the Division CP.At 2305 hours Headquarters and Headquarters Battery of Division Artillery,the 319th Glider Field Artillery Battalion and the 320th Glider Field ArtilleryBattalion glided into NORMANDY and encountered severe enemy small armsand mortar fire. Reorganization commenced immediately but washandicapped by intense enemy fire. The section of the 456th Parachute FieldArtillery Battalion attached to 505th Parachute Infantry jumped with the 3dBattalion, but was able to assemble only one of the two 75mm pack howitzerswhich had been dropped.80th Airborne Antiaircraft Battalion (AT)Batteries A and B landed by glider at 0405 hours. Six 57mm antitank gunshad been recovered and were in position by 1750 hours. Battery C glided intothe area at 2100 hours and began assembly and reorganization. Theremainder of the Battalion sailed from BRISTOL, ENGLAND, at 0645 hours.307th Airborne Engineer BattalionCompany B (less one platoon attached to the 505th Parachute Infantry)jumped with the 508th Parachute Infantry at 0210 hours. Some Engineerpersonnel took up defensive positions at LA FIERE in support of one group ofthe 506th, and other personnel joined the 508th group west of theMERDERET River. One âstickâ, which included the Battalion Commander, wasdropped over ST. SAUVEUR LE VICOMTE, and only a few escaped. Part ofHeadquarters and Company A landed by glider at 2300 hours and started toassemble under heavy enemy artillery and small arms fire. The reminder ofthe battalion prepared to take off from airports in ENGLAND.307th Airborne Medical CompanyElements of the company landed by glider about 2100 and immediately beganassembly, recovering by use of life rafts much equipment from gliders thathad landed in shallow water near the banks of the MERDERET River. Aclearing station was set up at a crossroad north of BLOSVILLE.82d Airborne Signal CompanyParachute and glider elements of the company which landed prior to H-Hourwere scattered and assembled with difficulty. Much equipment was lost. Onlyone of the three SCR 193 radios landed during D-Day was operative, and itwas not until the night of June 6-7 that radio contact was established with the4th Infantry Division and with the Division base in ENGLAND.D PLUS 1, 7 JUNE 1944The Division continued to assemble, reorganize, and seccure its area againstextremely severe enemy resistance which included armor. Enemy troops,identified as the 91st Infantry Division, were held along the MERDERET Riverto the west and were driven back to the north and northwest. Contact wasestablished with the 4th Infantry Division during the day, and the VII CorpsCommander visited the Division Command Post late in the day. The 325thGlider Infantry arrived by glider during the morning. Additional personnelwhich had been scattered in the original landings continued to report back totheir units.During the afternoon garbled radio messages signed âCO 507â were receivedat the Division Command Post, and it was finally determined that theyoriginated with the Regimental Commander who was isolated with a group ofabout 300 men west of AMFREVILLE.325th Glider Infantry RegimentÂ The first glider elements began landing at 0700 hours about 2,500 yardssoutheast of STE. MERE EGLISE. They were many crash landings, andcasualties totalled approximately 7.5 per cent. Assembly was rapid, however,and by 1015 hours all battalions were reported. The 3d Battalion moved outtoward CARQUEBUT at 1415 hours and reached LE PORT (328918) withoutencountering opposition. The remainder of the regiment proceeded to moveinto an assembly area northeast of CHEF DU PONT. At 1600 hours the 2dBattalion was ordered to move into an assembly area east of LA FIERE in thevicinity of 325962 and later was attached to the 505th Parachute Infantry at2100 hours. The 1st and 3d Battalions were ordered to move into and tooutpost the regimental assembly area. Company F, 3d Battalion in support ofCompany C, 746th Tank Battalion, and the 1st Platoon, Troop B, 4th CavalryReconnaissance Squadron, assisted the 8th Infantry in its attack towards STE.MERE EGLISE from the west at 0630 hours and made contact with gliderborneelements of the 325th by 0900. The 325thâs regimental strength at the closeof the day was approximately 85 per cent.505th Parachute Infantry RegimentThe 2d and 3d Battalions continued to hold STE. MERE EGLISE against severalattacks from the north and south. The 2d Battalion patrols contactedelements of the 8th Infantry Regiment of the 4th Infantry Division at STE.MARTINE (384973) at 1000 hours and attacked north to clear the outskirts ofSTE. MERE EGLISE. The 1st Battalion withstood several counterattacks andpushed the enemy back to the eastern bank of the MERDERET River in thevicinity of the LA FIERE Bridge. They were supported late in the day by oneplatoon of tanks from Company C, 746th Tank Battalion. At the close of theperiod the 2d and 3d Battalions prepared to attack north toward NEUVILLE AUPLAIN in conjonction with the 4th Infantry Divisionâs drive on the right. The2d Battalion, 325th Glider Infantry, was attached at 2100 to assist in thisattack.507th Parachute Infantry RegimentThe regiment moved into an area west of STE. MERE EGLISE in the vicinity of335960, rested and reorganized. At 1600 hours the regiment moved intopositions south of the LA FIERE â STE. MERE EGLISE Road west of therailroad to assist the 1st Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry, against athreatened counterattack at the LA FIERE Bridge. AT 1900 hours the 507th, atapproximately 25 per cent strength, successfully pushed the enemy back tothe west bank of the MERDERET River in its sector.508th Parachute Infantry RegimentÂ One group near the railroad overpass (323960) moved into positions in thevicinity of the road junction 334972 to protect the Divisionâs north flankagainst enemy penetration. This group was in position by 0630 hours, but itlater moved to join another group of the regiment in position defending theCHEF DU PONT Bridge. It mopped up numerous enemy strong pointssurrounding CHEF DU PONT and established patrol contact with elements ofthe regiment west of the MERDERET River on the high ground in the vicinityof 310940. The group on the high ground, now recognized as the 2dBattalion, had completed organization of its position by 1300 hours, wipingout a number of enemy mortar and artillery positions. A road block was set upon the western approaches to the CHEF DU PONT Bridge and contact wasestablished with forces in CHEF DU PONT. Regimental strength at the close ofthe day was approximately 25 per cent.82d Airborne Division ArtilleryVarious groups of the artillery were involved in individual skirmishes with theenemy as they found their way back to their parent units. The 319th GliderField Artillery Battalion Assembled east of STE. MERE EGLISE in the vicinity of371974 with six 75mm pack howitzers. The 320th Glider Field ArtilleryBattalion was placed in direct support of the 505th Parachute Infantry. Aftersalvaging two 105mm M3 howitzers and taking over the 75mm pack howitzerof the 456th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion detachment with the 505th,the 320th went into position 400 yards west of STE. MERE EGLISE. The firstround was fired at 0911 hours. The seaborne echelon of the 456th ParachuteField Artillery Battalion arrived off Utah Beach but did not land.80th Airborne Antiaircraft BattalionBatteries A, B, and C continued to reorganize and by 1800 hours six 57mmantitank guns of Battery C and three guns each from Batteries A and B werein position covering the two bridges over the MERDERET River. The remainderof the Battalion remained on board ships preparing to disembark on UtahBeach.307th Airborne Engineer BattalionThe remainder of Company A landed by glider at 0700 hours and moved tojoin the 325th Infantry in the vicinity of CHEF DU PONT at 0930hours. Bridgesand culverts south of LE PORT (328918) and near LIESVILLE (331905) wereblown.Aerial ResupplyAn aerial resupply mission, including 148 of the 248 C-47 planes which hadtaken off, arrived over the area at 0620. They dropped 155.5 tons ofordnance, quartermaster and medical supplies, 74% of the originallyscheduled load. The drop pattern was poor and bundles were scattered, manyof them falling into enemy hands or being covered by enemy fire. Limitedrecovery was effected initially.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BETWEEN 7 and 10 August 1944, Lieutenant-General Guy
Simondss 2nd Canadian Corps waged a battle south of Caen that
could have brought about an early and more decisive conclusion to
the Normandy Campaign had the Canadians reached the objective of
Falaise and completed the encirclement of the German Fifth Panzer
and Seventh Armies. The failure to take Falaise during Operation
Totalize constituted a missed opportunity of great significance for the
balance of the campaign in Northwest Europe. An unqualified understanding
of the battle has been thwarted by a relative lack of scholarly
attention as well as the enigmatic nature of available evidence.
The secondary literature has not benefited from the degree of interest
generated by operations like the Dieppe raid, to which numerous
monographs have been devoted. Most secondary accounts of Totalize

Abstract
First Canadian Armys fighting fitness in the Battle of Normandy has
long been a point of debate among military historians. Because Operation
Totalize did not result in the early conclusion of the campaign,
some suggest that the Canadians could have fought more effectively.
Heavy air support was a crucial component in the plan for Totalize,
but it has received insufficient attention from historians. A focus on the
role of air power suggests that previous explanations for the operations
failure, and criticism of Guy Simondss generalship, are in need
of revision.

have therefore been chapter-length studies in works with a more general
scope.1 In the absence of more exhaustive inquiry, particularly
into the process of planning the battle, a number of myths have been
perpetuated which purport to explain the failure of Totalize to realise
all that was expected of it.
Substantial criticism of Simondss generalship and the performance
of 2nd Canadian Corps has been largely based on the acceptance of three
major myths. First, the operation was doomed in advance by a plan that
was tactically flawed, too complex, and too rigid. Second, by adhering to
a preconceived air support plan that was intended to blast open a path
to Falaise, Simonds permitted a pause in the advance that squandered a
momentary opportunity to break through, thus allowing the Germans
time to regroup and stabilize their defences. As if these fundamental
weaknesses were not sufficient cause for failure, critics place a full measure
of blame on the inexperienced 4th Canadian and Polish Armoured
Divisions, which allowed a few tanks and antitank guns to stop them
when more seasoned formations would have boldly pushed on up the
road to Falaise in the operations second phase.2
There are elements of truth behind these myths, but as explanatory
factors they ultimately leave too many questions unanswered. Why did
Simonds choose to build his plan around heavy bombers, which, according
to Kurt Meyer, commander of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend,
transferred the initiative from . . . leading combat elements to
timetable acrobats of . . . Headquarters?3 Why did he not cancel the
Phase II bomber strike on the morning of 8 August, by which time the
success of the initial advance supposedly left the road to Falaise undefended
and open? Simonds and his troops have been judged partly on

the basis of testimony from combatants like Meyer, but a satisfactory
evaluation must begin with a detailed examination of the relationship
between intelligence and the interservice planning process. The following
analysis therefore traces a complicated series of meetings and
reports both to ascertain what Simonds knew at various points during
that process, and to reveal the parameters that were imposed upon him
as the quid pro quo of a joint operation. Critics who have not done so
attribute to Simonds, by default, a degree of control that he simply did
not have. Factors influencing command decisions were far more complicated
than the mythology suggests, and the fog and friction of war
affected the execution of his plan far more significantly.
Simonds made air support a key element in his plan first and foremost
because the tools with which he had to work were not adequate to
overcome the German defences at a sustainable loss rate. The Allies prewar
failure to analyse seriously the problems of armoured warfare was
the most important debt that had to be paid during the battles in Normandy.
Not expecting to make a grand continental commitment, neither
the British nor the Americans had overly concerned themselves with the
development of progressive tank designs or assault tactics before the
war. The result was the significant and much-discussed qualitative disparity
between the Allies standard tank, the Sherman, and the German
Panther and Tiger tanks. Both of the latter had heavier armour and more
powerful guns than the Sherman, although they were not as mechanically
reliable. Fortunately for the Allies, the enemy possessed fewer of
these than the smaller and much less dangerous Panzer IVs. Those that
were available made an impact beyond their numbers in morale effect
alone; realizing that their standard antitank weapons had little effect on
such monsters must have occasioned much anxiety among Allied tank
crews and antitank gunners.
The comparative weakness of Allied armour was symptomatic of the
lack of an appropriate doctrinal guide, which now had to be formulated
as the campaign wore on. Not surprisingly, therefore, the Allies failed, on
occasion, to coordinate the right weapon with the right tactics. Cooperation
between armour and infantry was only one example. While the
infantry expected mobile gunnery and direct support against enemy targets,
Allied armour could not survive engagements with German tanks
and antitank guns in open ground. Tank crews thus preferred to offer
indirect support from dead ground.4 The improvised use of strategic
bombers did not make this problem go away, but by incorporating them
into his plan for Operation Totalize, Guy Simonds attempted to compensate
for the armys tactical weakness with additional firepower.

Because that firepower could be applied either in conjunction with or
independent of 2nd Corpss artillery, he hoped it would also alleviate the
logistical problems of maintaining support during a breakout.
By late July 1944, 21st Army Group seemed poised to make that
breakout. The Allied advance following the D-Day landings had been
slow, and it had seemed that a stalemate might develop. Caen, a D-Day
objective, was finally taken on 9 July during Operation Charnwood. The
open ground south of the city promised adequate space for the employment
of armour, and the first major tank operation by Lieutenant-General
Miles Dempseys Second British Army was launched on 18 July.
Operation Goodwood saw a massive heavy bomber strike on the flanks
of the advance, which was led by three armoured divisions. Goodwood
ground to a halt in the face of stiff German antitank defences, and
although the results of the bombing attacks were inconclusive, soldiers
interviewed by British operational research personnel were unanimous
in their desire for more bombing support. One important conclusion
drawn from Goodwood was the need for an air plan which would hit targets
in depth as the leading troops advanced.5
The results of Goodwood were disappointing, but the lessons learned
would be applied in Simondss plan for Totalize. Meanwhile, the Normandy
bridgehead had been expanded enough to allow the buildup of
forces that General Bernard L. Montgomery wanted before he felt strong
enough to push the Germans back toward the frontiers of the Reich.
First Canadian Army, under Lieutenant-General H. D. G. Crerar, became
operational on 23 July and took over the eastern flank of 21st Army
Group. Crerar commanded 1st British Corps and, from 31 July,
Simondss 2nd Canadian Corps, which had just been defeated with heavy
casualties in its attempt to take Verrières Ridge in Operation Spring on
25 July. That same day First U.S. Army began its breakout operation,
Cobra, on the western flank.
Like Dempsey, American General Omar N. Bradley had opted to use
heavy bombers to open a gap in the German defences along the St.
LôPériers road, into which poured his armoured and motorized divisions.
Cobra was ultimately a success, but it included two short bombing
incidents by the American Eighth Air Force. Though poor weather in
Normandy caused a twenty-four-hour postponement on 24 July, the
decision had come too late to call back bombers that were already in
flight. Only a portion of the aircraft dropped their bombs, but a number
struck American positions, killing 25 and wounding 131. When the oper5.

ation went ahead the next day, more short drops killed another 111 and
wounded 490.6 On the other side of the road, however, the bombing was
a stunning success. The German Panzer Lehr Division, concentrated
inside the target zone, was virtually annihilated.
Following Operation Cobra, Montgomery had issued a directive on
27 July which specified that large scale operations were not to be
undertaken on the Caen front because the Germans, with seven panzer
divisions in the area, were too strong there. Still, the changed circumstances
that issued from Cobra made it essential to prevent any shift of
these strong armoured forces to the west where they might interfere with
the developing American breakout. First Canadian Army was therefore
to make additional, limited holding attacks while Second British Army

prepared to deliver the main blow on the eastern flank. Second Army
accordingly launched Operation Bluecoat in the Caumont sector, southwest
of Bayeux. It began on 30 July but, as with Goodwood, success was
limited.7
By the time Bluecoat began the German armour had already started
to move. Of the panzer divisions on the Caen front on 26 July, 21st
Panzer, 12th SS, 1st SS, and 10th SS were holding parts of the front line,
while 116th, 2nd, and 9th SS were in reserve. On 27 July, 2nd and 116th
Panzer moved west to bolster the desperate Seventh German Army. 9th
SS and 10th SS Panzer Divisions then moved to counter Bluecoat beginning
on 1 August. During a meeting with Crerar on 29 July, Montgomery
again emphasized the importance of holding in place, as far as possible,
the strong enemy forces south of Caen.8 His subsequent directive,
issued a few days later, officially ordered First Canadian Army to attack
toward Falaise with the object of capturing as much terrain as possible
and cutting off the enemy forces opposing Second Army across the
Orne.9 Crerar assigned the task to the commander of 2nd Corps, but as
events unfolded during the first week of August, Simondss operation
took on an entirely greater significance than had originally been forecast.
The architect of Operation Totalize had more combat command
experience than any of the other Canadian general officers serving in
Normandy, Crerar included, yet this amounted to a mere six months
leading the 1st Canadian Infantry and 5th Canadian Armoured Divisions
in Sicily and Italy. He was one of the few elite officers in the Canadian
Army, having attended the British Staff College at Camberley in 1936
and 1937. Of the teaching there he later said, [t]he essence . . . was not
to indoctrinate officers with preconceived theories, but to make them
think and come up with their own solutions to the problems of modern
war. Simonds was the sort of officer who took those lessons to heart. He
was an intellectual, considered by Montgomery to be the only Canadian
general fit to hold high command in war. To Bradley, he was the best
of the Canadian generals, and Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks,
whose 30th British Corps would serve under First Canadian Army during
much of the fighting in the Rhineland later in the war, said Simonds
was a first-class commander with a most original brain and full of initiative.
Apart from his brilliance, Simonds developed a reputation as a
hard-driving commander who was ruthless in sacking subordinates

who did not produce results. One brigadier summed him up: Simonds
was not a man one could love. In my heart I knew, however, that I
would rather serve under [his] type than under a more kindly but less
driving commander; the former is much more likely to win the battle.10
Simonds had set down an operational policy in February 1944 to
guide training within his corps, then preparing for the Allied advance
that would follow the first stage of Overlordthe securing of the lodgement
area and the buildup of 21st Army Group. The policy noted the
characteristics of the German defence system and tactics that were to be
expected: a sparsely held line of outposts strongly supported by machine
guns and mortars, with inevitable armoured counterattacks to retake
lost ground. Simonds explained that the
success of the offensive battle hinges on the defeat of the German
counter-attacks, with sufficient of our own reserves in hand to
launch a new phase as soon as the enemy strength has spent
itself. The defeat of these counter-attacks must form part of the
original plan of attack which must include arrangements for
artillery support and the forward moves of infantry[-]supporting
weaponsincluding tankson the objective.11
Simonds had been trained as an artillery officer, and his preferred
method of assault was informed to a significant extent by the abilities
and limitations of the artillery. Attacking divisions were to operate on
narrow frontages with forces disposed in depth, a decision prompted by
the inability of divisional artillery to support more than one of its three
brigades at a time. Likewise, the divisional engineers could open and
maintain only one two-way route to handle the divisions traffic. The narrow
front and resulting depth of the division would give it staying
power, which in turn would enable offensive operations to be planned
with fewer phases. Simonds defined a phase as the transfer of responsibility
between units and formations and their commanders for continuance
of operations, and every new phase meant a pause while the
transfer was carried out, which would give the enemy time to recover
from the initial shock of an assault. Because counterattacks would be
supported by tanks and mortars, and the effective range of enemy mortars
caused them to be sited approximately four thousand yards behind
the forward positions, the first phase of an assault must have planned
objectives at least four thousand yards within the German positions if
the mortars were to be put out of action before they could interfere with
consolidation on the objectives.12

Simonds also ordered that special consideration be given to determining
the point at which artillery should be moved forward during the
attack, because during the resulting pause the leading troops would be
without full fire support. This question posed a dilemma: should attacking
forces continue beyond their objectives in order to exploit the temporary
opportunity presented by the enemys disorganization, thus
incurring the risk of moving beyond the range of their fire support, or
should they accept a pause and wait for the guns to move up? As a rule,
Simonds believed it necessary to wait for support. Given Allied air
supremacy in Northwest Europe by the summer of 1944, the problem of
the pause could be alleviated with a method that he had first proposed
before the war. Simonds had written, in 1939, that
[a]ir bombing may develop to the stage where massed air craft,
converging from distant aerodromes, can provide a sustained
bombardment of the necessary accuracy and intensity to give
covering fire to troops. This would obviate the difficulty of a
secret concentration of masses of artillery close to the front of
attack.13
By the time Simonds began to plan Operation Totalize, precedents
for the use of heavy bombers to provide ground support had already been
set in Operations Charnwood, Goodwood, and Cobra, although senior air
officers were strongly opposed to such missions. There is much evidence
of an almost antipathetic interservice rivalry that seriously hindered
armyair force cooperation, and such attitudes particularly thrived
within the Royal Air Force (RAF).14 Eighth Air Force and RAF Bomber
Command operated under the direction of General Dwight D. Eisenhower
and SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Force)
during the Battle of Normandy, however, so with these resources available
Simonds used his prewar thinking as the theoretical foundation for
Totalize. By using air support as a substitute for artillery, he would be
presented with the additional problem of coordinating air strikes with
the ground assault. The degree of cooperation required by such tactics
would prove elusive, given the state of communications technology in
1944 and the jealous guarding of jurisdiction that occurred within the air
forces.
Simondss tactical doctrine may have looked fine on paper, but his
corps had been roughly handled by the Germans during Operation
Spring. Contradicting Simondss ideas about narrow frontages was the

experience gained by 3rd Canadian Division since D-Day, which taught
that assaults were better launched on wide fronts so as to compel the
enemy to disperse his defensive power.15 And for all the discourse on taking
objectives and defending them against counterattacks, how was this
to be done? The first requirement was to breach the forward line of
defensive positions, which, as in Cobra, was usually done with infantry
divisions. Because of the infantrys vulnerability to the small-arms fire
and fragments from mortar bombs that covered these positions, the initial
breach could more easily be made by armour. The accepted role of
the tanks, however, was the exploitation of the breach, and in any case,
infantry were needed to neutralize the antitank guns in the rear areas if
the tanks were not to be shot up like ducks in a gallery. The problem,
therefore, became one of enabling the infantry to reach the guns in the
rear by moving them safely through the forward zone.16 Once the forward
line was broken and first-phase objectives reached, how were the
counterattacks to be dealt with? One way to prevent reinforcements
from interfering, according to historian John A. English, was to isolate
the objective area by boxing it in with [artillery] barrages.17 These were
the two essential problems confronting Simonds when he began to plan
Operation Totalize at the end of July.
Opposite the Canadian positions on the northern slope of Verrières
Ridge, which had remained in German hands despite repeated attacks
since Goodwood, were two lines of defence that would have to be broken
before Falaise was reached. The forward position occupied the line from
May-sur-Orne through Tilly-la-Campagne to La Hogue, and was dominated
by the high ground at Point 122, about two miles to the rear. Previous
attempts to take May and Tilly had been especially bloody and
futile affairs. The second partially prepared position extended from
Bretteville-sur-Laize to St. Sylvain, and was controlled by the high
ground about Hautmesnil, somewhat less than a mile in the rear. Both
lay astride the Caen-Falaise road, which would serve as 2nd Corpss axis
of advance. Photo reconnaissance had identified a mass of small
weapon pits and potential M[achine] G[un] sites between the two positions.18
Intelligence had been able to accurately locate the main gun
areas that would provide further support to the German lines. Longrange
batteries, comprising sixty to seventy 88-mm antitank guns and
similar numbers of 20-mm antiaircraft guns controlled by Wolfgang Pickerts
3rd Flak Corps, occupied positions behind the secondary line.19

Across the Orne, Panzer Group West faced Second Army, and Simonds
recognized the importance to the Germans of holding these two defensive
lines in order to guard their positions on the Orne.20
As of 1 August the frontline defences were being held by 1st SS and
9th SS Panzer Divisions, which had been mainly responsible for defeating
Operation Spring. Intelligence indicated that each division was keeping
one of its two infantry regiments in the rear area to work on the
secondary position and to form the nucleus of a defence in the event of
a break in. Simonds assumed that in such an event, the Germans
would rely on being able to get tanks and SPs [self-propelled guns]
back to improvise a defence on the rear position. 12th SS Panzer Division
Hitlerjugend was believed to be in close reserve opposite our
front, so it could be expected to counterattack on 2nd Corpss eastern
flank.21 The Corps Intelligence Summary for 28 July also anticipated the
arrival of an additional infantry division from Fifteenth Army, still waiting
in vain for the real invasion north of the Seine River in the Pas-deCalais.
Intelligence predicted that the Germans would have to replace
the armoured divisions on the Caen front with infantry so that the former
could be moved to stabilise the critical situation on Seventh Armys
front:
Three days ago the enemy appeared to be using his tanks to provide
a screen behind which the infantry could dig defences. It was
then believed, and was probably the case, that his infantry was
spread very thin along the line. It is unlikely that the infantry
positions discovered by [tactical reconnaissance] would increase
in extent daily without him contemplating further infantry to man
them.22
Although they were spread thin, the Germans would likely concentrate
their infantry around tactically important localities, and . . .
leave gaps in parts of the line which they would cover by fire from automatic
weapons and antitank guns.23 On 1 August, First Canadian Army
Intelligence also reported the beginning of a third line . . . 2000 [yards]
in length, two miles NORTH of POTIGNY.24 Simonds was therefore confronted
by three potential defensive lines covered by an array of
machine guns, Nebelwerfersthe dreaded moaning Minnies, multibarrel
rocket projectorsand numerous artillery pieces including large
numbers of equally notorious 88s. Though understrength in infantry, the

firepower and armoured counterattacks that the Germans could bring to
bear compelled Simonds to devise an innovative plan if a débâcle like
Operation Spring was not to be repeated.
Against this backdrop, Simonds produced a written appreciation for
Operation Totalize on 1 August. It noted the German dispositions opposite
the front of 2nd Corps, and explained the significance of the open
terrain for the impending attack: it would offer little cover for infantry or
tanks, and the long range of [German] antitank guns and mortars, firing
from carefully concealed positions, provides a very strong defence in
depth. Because the original object of the operation was to hold the German
armour on the Caen front, the Canadians had done everything
possible to indicate that we intend to continue attacking. Surprise could
not be achieved, therefore, except in respect to the exact time and
method of attack. The concept behind Simondss proposed method was
strongly influenced by Operation Goodwood. On 18 July he had watched
as twenty to thirty tanks were destroyed within seconds of crossing the
startline for the attack. Resolved to find a less costly method,25 he told
Crerar:
In essence, the problem is how to get armour through the enemy
gun screen to sufficient depth to disrupt the German antitank gun
and mortar defence, in country highly suited to the tactics of the
latter combination. It can be done
(a) By overwhelming air support to destroy or neutralize
enemy tanks, antitank guns and mortars.
(b) By infiltrating through the screen in bad visibility to a sufficient
depth to disrupt the antitank gun and mortar defence.
It requires practically the whole day bomber lift to effect (a) and
if two defence zones are to be penetrated a pause with loss of
speed and momentum must be accepted. It is considered that this
may be avoided if the first zone is penetrated by infiltration at
night but this can only be attempted with careful preparation by
troops who are to do the operation.26
Breaking through the frontline positions required the infantry to
bypass somehow the strongpoints like May-sur-Orne and Tilly-la-Campagne
which had repulsed repeated Canadian attacks with heavy casualties.
Infiltration at night would sharply reduce the ability of German
antitank gunners to disrupt the advance, but machine guns were not sufficiently
handicapped in darkness because they were capable of indirect
fire along fixed lines.27

The ill-fated action at Dieppe in August 1942 is
most often remembered for the heavy casualties
suffered by the Canadian land forces deployed in the
assault and the political controversy that followed
this military debacle. Lingering doubts over the
rationale for the raid, and persistent statements
that lives were lost in vain, continue to this day. But
the Dieppe Raid was much more than casualties
and questionable military decision making. It had
immediate and valuable implications on the planning
and conduct of future Allied amphibious operations,
particularly the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944.
Operation Jubilee was the first joint operation of
consequence conducted by British and Commonwealth
forces in the European theatre during the Second
World War. It was joint because the three services
 the navy, army and air force  planned and
executed the raid in concert with each other. Sadly,
for the Allied forces involved, it also demonstrated
just how unprepared they were in 1942 for joint coordination
at the operational level of war. In many
respects, the raid took the form of three separate
services executing pre-arranged single-service plans
that at best were loosely co-ordinated. So long as
their activities went according to plan, which was
the case for the navy and the air force, they were
successful. Missing was the flexibility of response
that is essential for effective impromptu action from
one or more service when enemy activity or other
unexpected developments disrupt pre-planned
operations. The post-raid Dieppe Report by the
Air Force Commander, Air Marshal Trafford Leigh-
Mallory, makes for interested reading on how the
British and, subsequently, the Anglo-American Allies
identified the key elements required for successful
joint and combined operations.
Leigh-Mallorys report focuses on the conduct of
the air operations but it also addresses how air forces
can best be used in future operations with the navy
and the army in both pre-arranged and impromptu
actions. For Leigh-Mallory it all begins with effective
command and control. RAF doctrine also emphasized
the importance of co-ordinating the entire air effort
 fighters, bombers, reconnaissance aircraft, etc.
 from a central point. Fighter Commands ground
control organization was used for this purpose and
it proved very successful in co-ordinating the various
offensive and defensive air operations during the
Dieppe Raid. A system of forward air control was also
established using radio links onboard headquarters
ships. This enhanced the flexibility of the air forces
by linking centralized control with decentralized
delivery. Moreover, it was on the basis of the success
achieve by the air forces during the Dieppe Raid that
the air plan for Operation Overlord was devised.
The Dieppe Raid also highlighted a number of
other important factors that affected the nature of the
contribution made by air forces in joint operations.
The primary importance of air superiority to all other
air operations, the impermanence of close support
and the many difficulties of target identification,
the benefits of an indirect application of air power
through dislocation rather than destruction of
enemy forces, and the pressing need to strengthen
cross-service understanding and develop common
operating procedures, all feature in the lessons
identified by Leigh-Mallory and the air staff from
the Dieppe Raid. Leigh-Mallory is also adept at
identifying the strengths and weaknesses of air
operations in a joint campaign and drawing the
correct lessons on how to maximize success and
minimize inherent weaknesses. His conclusions are
particularly apposite and many of the observations
made in his Dieppe Report had direct impact in both
the air plan and the wider planning for D-Day and
the Normandy Campaign.
The Dieppe Report, therefore, is one of the
more important lessons learned documents of the
Second World War. It established a clear conceptual
framework, based on hard earned and costly
experience, for joint and combined operations
that were the pre-requisites for an Allied victory in
Europe.

Leigh-Mallory: Air Operations at Dieppe

Sir,
I have the honour to forward herewith my
Report on the part taken by the Air Forces in the
DIEPPE Operation on 19th August, 1942.
2. This Operation involved landings at
Dieppe by our troops at first light followed by
a withdrawal about mid-day. The Air Forces
involved operated most intensively throughout
the day from dawn until late into the afternoon.
As the withdrawal was made on the same day as
the landing a far heavier strain was imposed on
the Air Forces than would have been the case had
our occupation of Dieppe been more prolonged.
3. Our attacks from the sea were made
under the supporting fire of destroyers only
against strong and well organised shore defences.
Every effort was made therefore to provide
maximum air support and air cover during the
initial assault.
4. This Air Support under fighter cover
compromised airborne smoke and bombing
attacks on enemy battery positions and the
shooting up of the enemys defences by cannon
Hurricanes. Of these, smoke was by far the most
effective. It was laid by Bostons and Blenheims
dropping 100lb. phosphorus smoke bombs from
about 50 feet.
5. The main landing was timed for 0520
hours and from 0510 to 0600 hours the smoke
from these bombs covered the front of the
Eastern Headland overlooking Dieppe. Both
the Naval and Military Force Commanders
accompanying the expedition report that no
intense fire came from this Eastern Headland
until the smoke had cleared. From then onward
there was intensive fire from that direction. A
further sortie of smoke aircraft was recalled as
a result of a signal from the Military Commander
requesting cessation of air support against
Bismark and Rommel. It subsequently transpired
that our troops had not advanced as far towards
the Eastern Headland as was then thought and
smoke was in fact still urgently required. When
further smoke was finally requested only a few
smoke bombing aircraft were available as the
remainder were loaded with SCI for the final
smoke curtain to cover the withdrawal. The few
available aircraft were however dispatched to the
Eastern Headland. During our final withdrawal a
smoke curtain laid across the frontage of Dieppe
again proved most effective in covering our ships.
6. Bombing attacks on battery positions
were not as effective as smoke. I had reckoned on
certain batteries opening fire on their SOS lines
after our flank landings had begun at 0450, but
these were very slow in getting into action. They
were not firing therefore when our initial bombing
attacks were made in the half light at the time of
our main assault and the Bombers thus found it
extremely difficult to locate their targets.
7. Cannon Hurricane attacks against
defences along the front of the main beaches in
support of the assault were extremely successful
though their attacks lasted only ten minutes.
The Naval and Military Force Commanders paid
tribute to the magnificent timing of this attack,
and reported that these Fighters completely

diverted enemy fire from our assaulting Infantry.
Unfortunately our Infantry touched down on
the beaches a few minutes late. They were thus
not able to take full advantage of the Fighters
presence, and when the Fighters had concluded
their attacks were subjected to heavy fire from
houses along the front.
8. It was intended to employ Bombers
against any enemy reinforcements making
for Dieppe but none were located. Insistent
demands were made for continued attacks
against enemy gun positions. Bombers proved to
be quite ineffective for this task although in the
circumstances it was the only use to which they
could be put.
9. Cannon Hurricanes throughout did
magnificent work, especially during the final
stage of the withdrawal when attacking machine
and heavier gun posts on the Headlands flanking
Dieppe. These attacks temporarily diverted fire,
thereby assisting our troops to disengage and to
re-embark.
10. The most satisfactory part of the
Operation from the Air Force point of view was
the cover given to the expedition. The earlier
fighter cover sorties left ground in the dark, and
arrived over Dieppe punctually at first light. They
patrolled between about 3,000 and 6,000 feet.
This worked well, as enemy aircraft came low,
in attempts to bomb and shoot up our ships.
Later, as bombers appeared, I was informed that
they were flying between 10,000 and 12,000 feet,
some dropping their bombs from these heights,
and others diving down. I adjusted the heights of
my patrols accordingly. I also learned that Focke
Wulfs were flying at about 15,000 feet and Spitfire
IX Squadrons were ordered to patrol above them.
These changes in tactics worked well and in all
some 45 Bombers were destroyed, 11 probably
destroyed and 54 damaged. That only one major
vessel in the expedition was seriously damaged
throughout the day can be attributed to the
excellent work of the Fighter Cover Squadrons.
11. The Air/Sea Rescue organisation as a
whole worked very well. Some 20 pilots all told
were picked up from the sea. It is regretted that
Dover should have lost three out of their five
rescue boats but it was quite impossible to keep
continuous track of their activities. Whilst under
the Fighter screen they were adequately protected
but at times they gallantly went beyond this cover
and suffered casualties.
12. An unsatisfactory feature of the Operation
was the low standard of aircraft recognition
displayed by friendly gun crews. Our own aircraft
were very frequently fired on and suffered
casualties. There are two obvious remedies for
this. Naval gunners should be given intensive
training in aircraft recognition, and selected
personnel skilled in the recognition of aircraft
should be carried in each ship. The Royal
Observer Corps is the most suitable source for
providing experts for this work.
13. I consider that the total casualties we
suffered in this Operation were remarkably light
in view of the number of Squadrons taking part
and the intensity of the fighting. Details given in
Appendix C reveal that the highest casualties
per Squadron were 2.5 in the Army Co-operation
Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons, and the
lowest .84 per Squadron of the Fighter Cover.
14. My main conclusions from the days
operations are:
(i) That smoke either dropped or laid from
aircraft is of the highest value in a combined
operation of any kind. I could quite easily
have done with treble the number of smoke
aircraft.
(ii) That such an Operation facilitates
fighting at altitudes best suited to our present
equipment.
(iii) That with the present relative strengths
in aircraft, adequate cover can be provided
for an expedition of this nature. Had the
battle been more prolonged my Squadrons
would have been in a better conditions than
the enemy to continue on the following day.
Reports since received indicate that the
German Air Force on the Western Front lost
between 150 and 200 aircraft. Although many
of our pilots had done as many as five sorties,
there was no undue sign of fatigue.
(iv) We gained much valuable information
concerning the forward control of aircraft,
both as regards Cover Squadrons and
Close Support aircraft. Controllers in the
Headquarters Ships were of the greatest

assistance to the Fighter pilots, and this
system calls for a wider application in future.
15. I cannot speak too highly of the way on which
all ranks of the Royal Air Force played their part
in this battle.
16. I am forwarding separately a list
of recommendations for decorations and
General Outline
1. Operation JUBILEE was a raid against
occupied territory with the purpose of capturing
by assault and occupying for a limited period,
the town of DIEPPE. Military tasks in the area
of DIEPPE included the destruction of local
defenses, power stations, dock installations  the
capture of prisoners and the destruction of the
aerodrome installations near the town. It was
also intended to capture and to remove German
Invasion barges and other crafts in the harbour.
2. The operation was planned to take
place on the first suitable morning for such a
landing between the 18th and the 23rd August.
The expedition sailed from the area of the
PORTSMOUTH Command in a succession of
groups starting at civil twilight on the evening of
the 18th August.
3. The Naval, Military and Air Forces
assigned to this operation are set out in
Appendices A and B to this report. A Sketch map
of the operation is attached at Appendix E [not
reproduced].
4. The plan prepared jointly by the three
Force Commanders involved a landing on
the outer flanks of DIEPPE at ORANGE
and YELLOW beaches by Nos. 4 and 3
Commanders, whose tanks were to neutralise
enemy Battery positions 6 miles to the East and
West of DIEPPE. At the same time a Regiment
of the 2nd Canadian Corps was to be landed to
secure GREEN Beach three miles to the west
of Dieppe, and to attack objectives on the West
outer perimeter of the town (HINDENBURG).
Simultaneously the Royal Regiment of Canada
was to secure BLUE Beach 1½ miles to the East
of DIEPPE, and objectives on the East flank of
the outer perimeter, i.e. BISMARK. Half an hour
after the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry and Essex
Scottish Regiment with the Camerons of Canada
were to make frontal assaults on RED and
WHITE Beaches in front of the town of DIEPPE.
This frontal assault was to have been supported

by an armoured detachment of 18 tanks. Later
a Royal Marine Commando was to land near the
Harbour of DIEPPE to demolish objectives in the
Dock area. A further echelon of tanks was then
to be landed making a total force of 38 tanks. It
was intended, when the tasks ashore had been
completed, to withdraw the whole force for reembarkation
at about 1100 hours.
Air Support
Air support was to be provided throughout
the operation as follows:
Fighter Cover
(i) Fighter cover and general protection
for the expedition throughout the hours
of daylight. The primary task of this cover
was to protect the expedition against air
attack. It was considered that the two most
dangerous periods in regard to attack from
the air would be the landing and withdrawal.
It was, therefore, decided that the strength
of this fighter cover should vary from 2 to 6
squadrons during the different phases of the
operation, with such reinforcement as might
prove necessary.
Close Support
(ii) (a) Close support, bombing and low
flying fighter attacks on selected targets were
to be made in direct support of the assault,
occupation and withdrawal.
(b) Smoke laying aircraft were to be used to
neutralize defences, both in accordance with
the pre-arranged plan and subsequently as
required at the request of the Military Force
Commander.
(c) Day Bomber Squadrons were to be
employed to attack both pre-arranged targets
and requested targets.
Reconnaissance
(iii)(a) Tactical Reconnaissance was to
be made over the area of the operation
including the lines of approach of any enemy
reinforcement.
(b) Coastal ASV reconnaissance from
Cherbourg to Boulogne was to be maintained
throughout the night prior to the assault.
(c) Fighter anti-surface vessel reconnaissance
patrols were to be maintained
throughout daylight hours.

Strategical Bombing
(iv) It had been agreed between the
three Force Commanders not to lay on
any preliminary or diversionary effort with
bombers prior to the assault in order not to
jeopardise surprise. A strategical bombing
attack was, however, planned against the
enemy aerodrome of ABBEVILLE, with a
view to interfering with the operation of his
defending fighters. This attack was to coincide
with the main withdrawal from the Beaches
at which time considerable interference was
anticipated from fighters operating from the
ABBEVILLE area.
Disposition of the Air Forces
in No.11 Group
6. The following forces were available:
Day fighter forces
50 Squadrons (Cover)
6 Squadrons Close Support
Day Bomber forces
2 Squadrons
Hurricane Bomber forces
2 Squadrons
Army Co-operation forces
4 Squadrons
Smoke forces
3 Squadrons
These forces were disposed as set out in the
Order of Battle, at Appendix A to this report.
7. The assembly of these forces involved
internal moves of Squadrons within No. 11
Group and the reinforcement of the Group by
15 Squadrons from outside. These extensive
movements were carried out on the 14th and 15th
August. Detail of the Squadron and necessary
maintenance unit moves were as follows:

Enemy Dispositions
9. The German Air Force had approximately
260 frontline single engined aircraft between
Brest and Texel. These were disposed as follows:
Holland 40
Pas de Calais 125
Brest to Fecamp 95
10. The German policy since June this year
has been to concentrate these air forces on a
few aerodromes along the Western Front. The
German system of reinforcement is flexible up
to a point, with extreme mobility of units from
one place to another. On the other hand he finds
difficulty in adapting his control areas quickly to
these reinforcements.
11. Apart from the reconnaissance units
and a small number of aircraft used for antishipping,
the whole of the German bomber force
on the Western Front has been in use by night
only. This force was disposed mainly in the
Dutch bases at EINDHOVEN, SOESTERBERG,
GILZE RIGEN and DEELEN. It numbered some
120 long range bombers with a further 100 at
BEAUVAIS, CREIL, CHATEAUDUN, CHARTRES
and RENNES. Reports from Pilots during the
Operation JUBILEE indicate that a small number
of bombers from reserve training units were
brought into action. It was considered unlikely
that he would be able to bring his fighters from
as far West as Brest or as far North as Holland
early in the operation. Thus the Fighter forces
likely to oppose us in the early stages were from
the ABBEVILLE area  50, BEAUMENT-LEROGER
area  50, CHER-BOURG area  20,
together with possible reinforcements from ST.
OMER and COURTRAI  approximately 30 and
45 respectively.

8. The following supplies of ammunition and
petrol were accumulated at Stations in No. 11
Group immediately prior to the Operation.

Command
12. Captain J. H. Hallett, R. N. was the Naval
Force Commander.
Major-General F. N. Roberts, MC was the
Military Force Commander.
Air Marshal T.L. Leigh-Mallory, CB, DSO, Air
Officer Commanding No. 11 Group, was the Air
Force Commander.
Operational Control
13. Control of all air forces was exercised
direct by the Air Force Commander from his
operational Headquarters at Uxbridge. Aircraft
were despatched on instructions issued from No.
11 Group Operations Room through the normal
Group to Sector, Sector to Squadron Dispersion
Point channels. The Force Commanders afloat
were able to ask at any time for special air
support from bombers or fighters by means of
the W/T link provided between Portsmouth and
the Headquarters Ship, and a listening watch
maintained at No. 11 Group Headquarters.
14. The lowest Squadron in the Fighter Cover
operated on No. 11 Group Guard No. 1 frequency
so that the Fighter Controller in either of the
Headquarters Ships could communicate with the
Squadrons of the Fighter Cover.
15. All outgoing Close Support Fighter
sorties called the Headquarters Ship by VHF
R/T when approaching the enemy coast. The
Fighter Controller in the Headquarters Ship
then, at the request of either the Military or Naval
Commanders re-directed Fighter sorties to attack
any suitable alternative target which the situation
demanded.
16. Despite the fact that a very large number
of Squadrons were being used throughout the
operation (over 60 squadrons) this method of
control worked admirably. During the whole
course of this very gruelling test of the normal
ground control organisation in No. 11 Group
there was no breakdown.
17. This proved conclusively that the existing
Fighter ground control organisation, although
primarily designed for defensive purposes,
provides all the facilities required for the
direction of offensive operations within normal
fighter range. The co-ordination of the Air Force
effort from a central point is essential. The Group
Operations Room with its extensive network of
communications augmented by advanced W/T
and R/T communication with local Commanders
in the expedition proved to be ideal.
18. The local control by the Headquarters
Ships proved equally successful. The bottom
Squadron of all Fighter Cover formations
operated on No. 11 Group Guard I frequency, and
were directed on to enemy aircraft by a Controller
in Headquarters Ship No.2. Close Support
Squadrons operated on a Tangmere Sector
Operational frequency and were directed on to
targets as required by the Military Commander
by a Controller in Headquarters Ship No.1. Thus
the two Headquarters Ships accompanying the
expedition were used to assist in the control of
air forces as would an AASC during a land battle.
19. In the majority of cases Close Support
Fighter Pilots had been briefed, as to the targets
to be attacked, before leaving the ground, but
experience gained during the operation showed
conclusively that it was possible to re-direct
Fighters or to give them assistance in finding their
target by local direction. Similarly Fighters were
frequently assisted in sighting enemy aircraft by

the running commentary given by the controller
in Headquarters Ship No. 2. There is no doubt
that this local control was largely responsible
for the high percentage of interceptions made
on enemy aircraft, thus greatly minimising the
effectiveness of enemy air attack on ships and
troops.
20. To summarise  the system of control
from the Group, through Sectors, and through
the Headquarters ships, adequately met all
requirements. The excellent communications and
flexible control facilities of the normal Fighter
organisation at home proved most efficient for
such combined operations.
Tactical Reconnaissance
21. Tactical Reconnaissance units suffered
a higher casualty rate than any other type. This
was due to the deep penetration required of them
which necessitated their patrolling well beyond
the Area of Fighter Cover. The coast roads leading
to Dieppe were reconnoitred every half hour,
and those from Amiens, Rouen, Yvetot and Le
Havre, places from which reinforcements might
be expected, every hour.
22. Aircraft took off from GATWICK, flew to
the Dieppe area via the BEACHY HEAD route,
made contact with the Command Ship, and then
proceeded on their allotted tasks. On completion
of each sortie Tactical Reconnaissance pilots flew
sufficiently near to the ship to ensure satisfactory
R/T transmission of any information they had.
They then returned immediately to GATWICK
and passed their information by telephone to the
Air Force Commander.
23. The only movement worthy of note was
that of about five light tanks approaching Dieppe
reported at 1210 hours.
24. The range of the HF fitted in the Tactical
Reconnaissance aircraft proved inadequate.
ASV Reconnaissance Patrols
25. Aircraft of Coastal Command maintained
ASV search patrols throughout the hours of
darkness on the flanks of the expedition during
the passage. No sightings were made.
General Narrative
26. The operation is conveniently divided into
five distinct phases. The first covers the outward
passage and the landings on various beaches.
The second covers the period when progress was
being made towards the predetermined objectives
ashore. The third phase covers the withdrawal
of landing parties to their beaches. The fourth
period extends to the time when the withdrawal
was complete. The fifth phase covers the return
passage to England.
Time
(2000 hours) 27. The expedition sailed
from the area of the Portsmouth Command in a
succession of Groups on the evening of the 18th
August, headed by the destroyer CALPE.
(2130 hours) 28. Shortly before dark the
convoy, which consisted of 217 craft in all,
steamed past the CALPE (Headquarters Ship
No. 1) to be checked.
(0115 hours) 29. In the early hours of the
19th August, the CALPE led the way through an
enemy minefield, which had already been swept
by a flotilla of mine-sweepers from Newhaven. A
quarter of an hour later the whole convoy was
safely through the minefield but it was noticed
that the LCTs had lagged some way behind.
(0300 hours) 30. Shortly after 0300 hours
the first landing craft were lowered from their
Refuelling a Canadian Spitfire. Nine Canadian
squadrons took part in Operation Jubillee, including
six Spitfire squadrons, two of Mustangs, and one of
Bostons.

parent ships. The lighthouse on the cliff outside
DIEPPE was then visible. Up to this time the
outward passage was comparatively uneventful,
but a misfortune now occurred.
(0320 hours) 31. T h e l a n d i n g c r a f t
conveying No. 3 Commando, which had been
detailed to attack YELLOW Beach (6 miles East
of DIEPPE) came into contact with an enemy
convoy which included armed trawlers, and a
number of our small craft were sunk. These
losses resulted in the failure to subdue coast
defence batteries to the East of DIEPPE.
32. There was no other enemy activity
throughout the night and no attempt was made
by the enemy to reconnoitre for our approaching
expedition. It would seem, therefore, that the
force was assembled and dispatched without
disclosure. It would have achieved complete
tactical surprise if No. 3 Commando had not
unfortunately been intercepted by the enemy
trawlers en route.
Phase 1 (0445  0550 hours)
33. Despite the chance contact with enemy
ships en route, the forces arrived at DIEPPE
approximately on time, and the initial naval
bombardment of selected objectives was carried
out as arranged.
34. In the opening attack, escort was provided
for smoke carrying aircraft of Bomber and Army
Co-operation Commands laying a smoke screen
over the Cliff Headland to the East of Dieppe
Harbour. This was most effective lasting from
0510 to 0600 hours. Intruder aircraft engaged
each of the two gun Batteries to the South of
Dieppe with bombs and machine guns. Hurricane
Bombers, Fighters and Spitfires attacked the
coastal emplacements, and beach defences.
Cannon fighters provided direct support to our
troops as they landed at RED and WHITE
Beaches in front of DIEPPE and were successful
in centralising enemy fire along the f",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

times elementary military teaching is forgotten or overlooked with the results that

-esults . This weakness is not necessarily confined to the troops actually engaged

IT TA TI AL TEA HING
In the Armored Force Field Manuals one obtains the idea from scanning the
:loverly designed sketches of ""do's and dont's"" of small unit-operations that it is
)esirable and proper for armor to attack anti-tank positions . Many sketches show
./aried methods of approach toward subduing an-AT gun . ( erience has proven, at
least in the Tunisian ampaign, that the AT gun is to be avoided as much as possible
'__d only attacked as a last resort . While the sketches are for the most part
orrect in the methods to be use under varied conditions still it should be more
strongly emphasized that .LT positions should be avoided by armor and only
~:~tacked when no other means of overcoming them is available . Instruction, before
-':.is command entered into actual combat, usually pre$ented the theoretical tacti-
`J1l situation to the platoon and even company commander with the problem of attack-
:4- and destroying an anti-tank position . It was up to him to .give a solution for
s situation . A false picture was here created and also a feeling of over-
'onfidence . In the initial stages of the operation cf this command in November
.,^d December, 1942, such over-confidence resulted in the rapid whittling down of a
,edium tank batta~ion to less than twenty tanks within a few minutes of actual
Z Dmbat, Another incidents Shortly afterward a platoon of .b1-4 replacement - t Vhk'
.ith new crews, upon being assigned a mission and given warning of the effect of
fire against the M-P tank, charged gloriously but vainly up a hill only to lose
;)ur out of five tanks from AT fire .
Talking to the platoon leader afterwards he truthfully explained that, one,
was confident that present enemy- AT guns were ineffective against the new M-4 t'
id, two, that his method of approach was based on an approved solution given under 0 .milar circumstances on maneuvers,

III ORGANIZATION OF A OMBAT OM ANA,
Under the n-osent set-up the staff of a combat command of an armored division
,.-snot function properly unless supplemented by additional staff officers . Should
.13- battalions be placed under the cbminand of a combat command without a regimen-
Training Purposes .
- 1 -
;_il headquarters these battalions will suffer in that certain of their .s taff offim.(
Irs, riamply an adjutant, personnel officer, an assistant . intelligence officer, a
apply officer, a motor officer and a surgeon, will, of a necessity, have to work
.1 the staff of the combat command which has none of-these key staff officers . The
ready small staff of a battalion is thereby weakened by the loss of one or more
its staff personnel and as a result the battalion is handicapped . On the other
ind when a regimental headquarters is placed under the command of the combat com-
-nd along with. other units, the regimental headquarters largely ceases to function
such, and thq regimental commander_ and certain members of his . staff, namely the
ritelligence officer, the executive officer, the operations officer, and the air
perations officer are without a job except as assistants to the combat command
taff or any other job given them by the combat commander .
In the Tunisian ampaign the tank regiment seldom, if ever, operated as such .
s the present trend appears to be the use of separate battalions, accordingly it
s believed that regiments should be disbanded and regimental staffs be incorporated
nto the combat commands thus giving the latter a complete working staff .
IV OFFENSIVE A TION
Throughout the entire Tunisian ampaign, offensive action by american troops
-s marked by the dispersal of effort, ht no time was a spearhead attack attempted
id the general fooling appeared to be one of fear of an enemy counter-attack . Itbelieved,
particularly in the latter stages of the campaign, that a concentration
effort upon a single objective rather than a coordinated drive with-all U .S.
.)mbat troops in the line would have resulted in the conclusion of the campaign
it more rapidly and with less loss of personnel and material . I step in the right
'Lrection towards this was the use of the lst armored 'Division, complete, in the
.nal stages_ of the battle east of Mateur .
On only one occasion, in February at Ousseltia Valley while under the French
th orps, did this command have sufficient infantry. But no sooner was the
:lion of driving the enemy from the valley completed than the infantry was
-^ved from this command by II U .S . orps order and the golden opportunity of
.ping the pass to Kairouan was lost . Furthermore at no time was armor, when
. .;(;3SS ful in making an advance as at Tebourba in December (while under the
.=tish V orps), Ousseltia in February, Kasserine in March, Maknassy in hpril,
.)wed up closely by infantry and its gains consolidated .
In the, employment of armor in the offensive, it is desirable to have the
""'a_try and artillery tear develop or detect soft spots in the enemy line and
t,,, n throw all available armor against these spots for a break-through . Once the
_rtiâ¢aK-through is accomplished, motorized infantry and plenty of it should quickly
!low up the advance of the armor . )
V THE DEFENSIVE
Two-thirds of the Tunisian ampaign was spent by Lmerican troops being on
defensive . It is well raolized that~ .,tho number of troops available to--
%quately hold in strength at all vital places was insufficient, but several
:knesses were noted which, if they had been rapidly corrected, would have
:""ovod the defensive strength of our lines immensely .
2 -
In moving about a battle-field, after its conclusion, it was always obvious
,There American troops had their positions due to' the fact that the ""digging in""
differed from that of the enemy . Masters of the art are the Germans and every
position held for any length of time whatsoever is pock-marked with dugouts or
foxholes for the men and excavations for the 88mm guns and other field pieces .
given the airfields of the enemy show the ""digging in"" theory . Wherever possible,
bomb shelters were built for the planes . No such shelters were ever noticed
on our own fields . It is absolutely necessary that all troops be impressed with
the ""digging in"" practice as many lives will be saved and troops, especially
infantry and AT personnel may undergo severe artillery fire and even be over-run
bby tanks without suffering undue losses and still be able to carry on the battle .
- shallow slit trench means an early grave, and a poorly dug in AT gun means
a weapon and crew lost .
oncealment is neglected in most cases . American troops in particular are
prone to use the skyline for a vantage point . In a great many cases officers are
even worse offenders than the men and staff officers in particular are prone to
""have a look at things"" while standing on the crest of a ridge .
Main positions are disclosed to enemy aircraft and even enemy OP's by movement
lighting of fire (British and French troops are even worse offenders than Americans
on this point), hanging out washing, reflectors (windshields ; tin cans, otc .)
and all other things basic training insists not be done . In conjunction with the
prevention of this, the aim should be to have alternative positions and only move
to battle positions when the' com :aanding officer feels the time is right .
Anti-tank mines were not used to their fullest advantage . ( ounter-attack by
enemy, tanks is always a chief danger after the capture of a position. The remedy
for this is the rapid organizationof AT defense and the laying of minefields as
quickly as possibla,
r
In connection with an enemy tank attack, there is a general feeling among-the
_oo,L)s that the 37mm__,mun is , .pot a goodanTi-tank wea pn . uue_Tolackof confidence
troops ara promo have a fooling o_ inse"" ^ur'
S ~~ chis always bad for those on
she defensive . It is most certainly desirable that a heavier caliber, lower
silhouette AT weapon be provided . _
Under any conditions reconnaissance and observation posts are vital. Through-
Dut the Tunisian ampaign, the front line was, for the most, a loosely held
,eneral line and in such a situation OP's play an extremely important role . Unfortunately,
reconnaissance by ground troops was usually not aggressive enough and
,oconnaissance by air almost always valueless . This latter was due to the fact
--_at up until, the time the enemy was on the run, alll his movements took place a night (we never had any night reconnaissance flights) or if something was
; potted during the day,, the' reports of .this failed to reach units that ;tore
-oncerned .
Observation posts :were widely used by the French and English and obviously by
he enemy . Toward. the latter stages of the . campaign, their use and advantages
)egan to- be more fully realized by- us . Even then, however, aside from artillery
orward observcrs, .personnel manning OP's were not impressed with the full extent
l their duties . It is mandatory that everyone within the command have a knowledge
f what to look for, record and report -while on OP duty . There should be specilly
trained men in each outfit for-this work ., As the German is mostly a
:reature of -habit, invaluable information may be obtained from the proper use of
;P's .
- 3 -
V1 LIAISON
Liaison between major units was often times lacking . This command, for
over half the ca.,ipaign, acted more or less as an independent unit and in many
instances had little ; if any, knowledge of exactly what was taking place or the
contemplated actions by adjacent commands . Our liaison officers found that the
British and the French were most cooperative but in some instances information
as difficult to get from American units . Mutual .liaison always existed between
our own command and the British and French but often times American commands
failed to establish it with this command . In the latter stages of the campaign,
however, this situation improved enormously . It must be stressed that liaison
is not only necessary but vital and' there can never be too much of it between units .
VII EMPLOYM N1 UNDER OMMAND OF 11 DIFPN:RENT NATIONALITY
It is recommended that no unit smaller than a division be employed under
command of a different nationality . - Each army has its own peculiar system of
training and employment of units as well as the use of equipment . The result of
attaching small units under foreign command results in the feeling of personnel
involved that their equipment and organization is being used improperly . The inevitable
is that a feeling of mistrust and lack of confidence springs up and
naturally every effort must be taken to avoid such a feeling if we are to continue
to be successful . It might also be added that communication and supply problems
-re also yet another difficulty in such a situation .
VIII OOPERATION BY SUPPORT MM OBSERV:ITION AVIATION
In the initial part of the campaign, close support aviation was completely
lacking. Only one instance of close support is known to exist up to the latter
)art of January 1943 . This occurred in the vicinity of Massicault on December 10,
L942 . :: flight of Spitfires (British) attacked and caused the withdrawal of some
_fifteen to twenty enemy tanks massing for an attack . The next example of close
support ectv-r_ed in hisseltia Valley the latter part of January when a prearranged
plan w7ith the 12th U .S . Air Support ontrol of marking a target with
Smoke for air bombardment proved highly successful. From that time on close
support increased and reached its n .ximum in thi battle of the Kasserine Valley
(actually the Bahiret Foussane Valley) around'F,bruary 24, 1943 . Here, in
:onjunction with our artillery, B-25's, B-17's,t-20's and all types of pursuit
ships played- a major part in stopping and finally routing the enemy. After this,
:lose support missions were most difficult to obtain as apparently the tactical
tir force had put into being a plan which minimized close support missions
-equested by ground troops .
-~
Aerial observation, as far as helping this command to know Ahe whereÂ®boutÂ§
_nd movements of the enemy, must be considered worthless up unti the latter part
)f Lpril. At this time the enemy,' being in full retreat, was moving both day
tnd night and reports as to his whereabouts began to flow in . On the other hand,
'oquests for aerial observation on certain definite localities were, even then, for
tie most, almost certain to be refused and if granted of little value due, one, the
ongth of time required to get report back to requesti'ng'headquarters and, two, the
ack of trained observers and observation planes .
!""t-no; time were night reconnaissance flights made on request and to the best
f the knowledge of this command, were not ever attempted .
It is firmly believed that mutual liaison between ground and air must be
improved down to and including a combat command especially when it is acting in a
separate capacity .
ooperation between ground and air increased as the campaign progressed but
much greater progress is needed . Among the many improvements, too numerous to
mention here, one simple and easily carried out plan could be accomplished . The
air support control should send senior officers to visit front line positions
and get the version of division and combat commanders actually engaged in fighting
as to the improvement of air support in their sector . As each sector presents a
different problem, spot solutions could be made and both ground and air would
benefit in their relations and the close support rendered would undoubtedly be
vastly improved .
Briefly summarizing steps to be taken to improve close support aviation, the
follo-Ang points are mentioned for consideratign :
a . Each armored division should have attached one observation squadron
and one fighter-bomber squadron .
b . A senior flying officerr should be on the staff of each division to
idvise the division commander on the capabilities and limitations of aircraft -
.vail.able and also on all other air data .
c . Division Headquarters and the two ombat ommands should have
Dernamently attached air support parties . These parties not only should act as
:hannels for air requests but also a source of all air reconnaissance information .
d .
definite policy (something not in e -~dstenco in the Tunisian
J~mpaign) of air-ground radio communication and air support requests should be used
e . !, system-of air to ground and ground to air recognition signals should
)e in effect throughout the combat zone .
IX PYROTE HNI S
Throughout the entire campaign the enemy made extensive use of pyrotechnics
end it was only in the late stages that their use came into even partial play by
.merican troops . Both French and British troops, especially the British Eighth
.rmy, also used this means of signalling . It is felt that pyrotechnics should
)o used in any future operation much more extensively and more emphasis placed
)n this phase in the training periods . On the occasions this command used this
system it was most effective . Its harassing effect, even on seasoned troops,
)roved very great .
X DEMOLITION KITS
On numerous occasions, especially in the withdrawal from the Sbeitla - Gafsa'
1r.a, the enemy was able to move rapidly in pursuit As little or no demolitioh was
xocuted on bridges, cculverts, defiles, etc . It-as .
, ~-
,
d~e~,ieved that at least one
-enolition kit of the cavalry type be an integral part of at least-ohe in every
Three armored vehicles .
5
l
In connection with this it is .also deemed highly desirable that every vehicle
be equipped with some sort of a charge whereby a vehicle can quickly -be rendered
useless when it becomes necessary to abandon it . At the"" close of the cari'paign
the enemy had in his possession scores of American vehicles, the majority of which
r.ould never have been able to be used had these vehicles been equipped with some
sort of a destroying charge .
XI MAPS X
Both British and American troop were severely handicapped throughout the
/campaign by the lack of- good maps . The French had only a very limited supply
of excellent maps of the country, On the other hand the enemy apparently had an
unlimited amount of these good maps and greatly profited by thorn .
The maps we used were not only faulty in showing existing road nets but the
reproduction of the original excellent French map was so poor as to be of very
little value . Towards the latter part of -the campaign the situation improved
end new and better reproductions were finally obtained .
It is felt, howevor, that in any future campaign an adequate supply of good
laps be ready for use upon demand .

To
Men of the Armored Replacement Training enter.
Armored soldiers at the front in Tunisia are trying to help you by what they say in
these pages . Many of them answered this question : ""What have you learned that will help
a younger brother just entering the Replacement enter at Fort Knox?"" They told these stories
to BRIGADIER GENERAL T. J . AMP, my assistant, at the front in Tunisia the first half of
April, when the going was hard .
LIEUTENANT GENERAL DEVERS, at that time hief of the Armored Force, included in
his order to GENERAL AMP, ""Get first-hand information . Get the story at the front. Go to
the enlisted man . See what he knows ."" I ordered him, ""Find out if our replacements are in
condition and are trained right for battle . heck them all the way from General Headquarters
to the units and from the gang plank to the battlefield ."" Army Ground Forces also
gave him a broad mission and GENERAL EISENHOWER appointed him his personal representative
. GENERAL AMP visited all American Armored Units in North Africa which had been
in action up to that time.
The talks were informal, occasionally the enemy interrupted . No one had a chance to
see the record of his talk, usually he didn't know the conversation was being written down in
longhand.
The men who talk to you in this book won the hard way ; heart and soul they hope
you will learn from them how to win easier than they did . You had better learn now to kill
or be killed or else you'll learn the hard way in battle .

INTRODU TION
In this book you will not find the ""big picture"" of the North African campaign, but
you will find the little tricks that saved the lives of fighting men and that may save yours.
These men won victory, and you can win if you will do what they tell you .
You ought to feel exceptionally good about one thing-the people in Africa who
knew said that the armored replacements had received the training necessary for victorious
fighting and were the tops of all American replacements .
You should get ready for battle here . Let SERGEANT DuHAMEL of the 60th Infantry,
from an outpost on a mountain peak in Tunisia, tell you in his own words how soon a replacement
may be fighting.
""I was sent as a replacement . I sailed from New York 5th March; landed in Oran
19th March ; sailed from Oran 21st March ; arrived Phillipeville night of 24th March; left
Phillipeville by truck 25th March; arrived at a post near onstantine 25th March ; left 26th
March; arrived Ain Beida 27th March; left Ain Beida 31st March ; arrived 9th Division 31st
March; was on outpost this mountain 1st April . I am one of one hundred replacements of
the 60th Infantry who are on this section of the mountain range .""
(See Page 13) Â°
Six places in less than a month! Direct from New York to a fighting post in Africa
from which the enemy was repulsed by hand-to-hand fighting in a night attack on 4 April,
the day after this talk . That is how close some of us are to the front.
The outstanding point from all statements was the need for exact discipline . The
private soldier felt the need of this discipline, as did the officer, because it meant that he
could be sure that the other fellow was doing his part. All through the pages you will read
stories which will tell you this.
GENERAL EISENHOWER said, ""Discipline is vital . A possible 50% improvement in value
of men results from making them tough and well disciplined . See that orders are carried out
exactly. We need exactness , in uniform and in saluting. Great nervous energy is required
of commanders . They must meet requirements and exact discipline and obedience.""
GENERAL HUEBNER said, ""Discipline is vital . The most important command is right
face, that is, to have a thing done at once, immediately .""
GENERAL SAWBRIDGE went a little further -he paid a tribute to armored replacements
and then said, ""Replacements generally lack fundamental discipline . They have not
learned initiative or to act for themselves . They wait for a non-commissioned officer.""
You should think about this ; discipline means more than just obeying direct orders, it
means doing what you ought to do without orders. The ability to rely on the other men in
*NOTE: The number given below each quotation is the number of the page in this book where the
full statement, from which the quotation has been taken, may be found .

your company and on the men of all the companies of all the arms that arc working with
your company to do what they ought to do is what wins victories and costs the enemy lives.
Physical fitness, maintenat%ce of equipment, skill in arms, are important; but above
them all is that discipline which makes it possible for each man to depend with safety on all
his comrades.
In the modest accounts that follow are stories of the highest heroism . Often you will
have to look closely to see how well these men have done . In years to come you will find
that many of the men in this book will have won fame for their deeds, for the deeds of which

Foreword
Iam delighted to have been asked to write the foreword to Guy Simonds and the
Art of Command for a number of reasons. First, General G.G. Simonds is
unquestionably one of Canadas great wartime military commanders and his
insights and views on command and leadership are extremely relevant for the
education and professional development of military professionals. Although the
battlespace the Canadian Army operates in today is significantly different from the
one our forefathers fought in, the concepts, principles and application of command
and leadership are not. They remain as critical to success, if not more so, now in
the ambiguous, complex and lethal environment of fourth generation warfare as
they did in the Second World War. Moreover, the insights provided by this
examination of General Simonds, particularly the annexes that replicate his actual
writings and directives, provide expert advice by a skilled practitioner and
commander.
The second reason I agreed to endorse this book is the fact that it is written
by a very distinguished Canadian historian, Terry Copp, who is recognized both in
Canada and internationally as an expert in military history, especially the period
in question. Copp has shown great skill and knowledge in recounting the trials
and tribulations, as well as the Herculean feats of the Canadian Army. He has
shown a rare commitment to honouring this nations soldiers, as well as educating
his fellow Canadians. This volume is just one more example of Terrys
achievements.
Finally, I agreed to write the foreword to this excellent monograph
because I fully support the concept of continuing education and study for
Canadian Forces personnel. Training and experience are vital for the development
of individuals and a first class army. However, education is equally important.
We as military professionals, as societys trusted practitioners of violence, must
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
vi
continually expand our knowledge and understanding of the profession of arms.
With so much at stake, namely the lives of those who we may command in harms
way, it is incumbent on each and every one of us who aspires to lead, to be as
conversant with the concepts and practice of the profession of arms as possible.
Studying the successes and failures of the past is one method to achieve this. Just
as critical is learning from the examples, experiences and knowledge of those who
came before.

Commander, Canadian Army

Preface
The Canadian Forces Leadership Institute (CFLI) is proud to release another
publication in its Strategic Leadership Writing Project under the auspices of
the Canadian Defence Academy (CDA) Press. Our intention has always
been to create a distinct Canadian body of operational leadership knowledge so
that professional development centres, military professionals, civilian members of
defence, scholars and the public at large could study Canadian examples instead
of the traditional reliance on foreign allied examples. After all, our military
history is rich with examples, and moreover, they are more pertinent and relevant
to our own military culture, temperament and character.
Significantly, our goal is being achieved through the collaborative efforts
of CFLI, Canadian Forces personnel, academic institutions and individual
researchers and scholars. Through their combined efforts, the body of
Canadian-specific military literature is growing and it is providing the necessary
examples and reference sources for military and civilian institutions across the
country and abroad.
This book, Guy Simonds and the Art of Command is a significant addition
to the project. Written by Terry Copp, a renowned Canadian military historian, it
provides an excellent account of one of Canadas great military commanders.
Although an examination of the command and leadership of G.G. Simonds in the
Second World War, the lessons drawn out are relevant to this day. Arguably, the
art and science of command and leadership are timeless and the value of Simonds
thoughts on these concepts, revealed through an analysis of Simonds campaigns,
specifically his directives, orders and writings, provide important insights into the
command philosophy of one of Canadas greatest wartime commanders. Many, if
not most, of these insights or lessons on command and leadership are as
pertinent today as they were when they were written.
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND

I believe you will find this book of great interest and value whether you
are a military professional, scholar or simply interested in the study of command
and leadership. As always, we at CFLI invite your comment and discussion.

Introduction
The purpose of this book is to document the ideas on leadership and
command expressed by Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds while serving as
General Officer Commanding (GOC) 2nd Canadian Corps. I have
attempted to offer a description of the context within which his views were put
forward and have included a brief explanation of the outcome of operational
decisions, but this is a book about Simonds approach to war, not a history of the
campaign in Northwest Europe.
Guy Simonds has been the subject of a book length biography, Dominick
Grahams The Price of Command as well as a number of essays and theses
including J.L. Granatsteins superb chapter Simonds: Master of the Battlefield
in his book The Generals.1 I have drawn upon these sources for background
information but relied on my own reading of the primary sources on operational
matters, borrowing from my books on the campaign, especially Fields of Fire: The
Canadians in Normandy and Cinderella Army: The Canadians in Northwest
Europe.2
The text deliberately avoids theoretical discussions of ideas about
leadership and command echoing Simonds pragmatic, analytical approach to both
training and operations. Simonds would have found the current fascination with
operational art and the operational level of war of some interest.3 Simonds
would have had no quarrel with current Canadian joint doctrine which defines the
operational level of conflict as:
The level at which campaigns and major operations are planned,
conducted and sustained to accomplish strategic objectives within
theatres or areas of operations. Activities at this level link tactics
and strategy by establishing operational objectives needed to
accomplish strategic objectives, sequencing events to achieve the
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
x
operational objectives, and initiating actions and applying
resources to bring about and sustain those events. These activities
imply a broader dimension of time and space than do tactics: they
ensure the logistic and administrative support of tactical forces
and provide the means by which tactical successes are exploited
to achieve strategic objectives.
The operational level is not defined by the number and size of
forces or the echelon of headquarters involved. In a large scale
conflict, a corps may be the lowest level of operational command.
However, in smaller scale conflict, operational level activity can
take place at much lower levels. Regardless of its size, a military
force tasked to achieve a strategic objective, is being employed at
the operational level.4
Those who wish to study the operational level of war would be well
advised to study Simonds approach to command especially during the battles to
open the approaches to Antwerp in October 1944 when he served as Acting Army
Commander.

CHAPTER 1
From Captain
to Corps Commander
Lieutenant-General Guy Granville Simonds assumed command of 2nd
Canadian Corps in January of 1944. He was forty-one years of age. A tall,
immaculately groomed figure, he was known throughout the officer corps
as a brilliant, cold, arrogant professional. He lived up to his reputation in the first
weeks of 1944, arranging the replacement of Major-General Frank Worthington,
GOC 4th Canadian Armoured Division, and a number of staff officers inherited
from his predecessor. On 17 February he issued the first of three directives
designed to prepare the corps for Operation OVERLORD. Before examining these
directives it may be worthwhile to try and understand just where Simonds evident
self-confidence and determination came from.
Simonds had graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada
(RMC) in 1925 winning the Sword of Honour and the award for the best allround
cadet, mentally, morally and physically. After serving with the Royal
Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA) for more than a decade he attended the twoyear
staff college course at Camberly in the United Kingdom and passed with
distinction.1 During his next posting as an instructor in tactics at RMC, Simonds
wrote several articles for the Canadian Defence Quarterly2 (reproduced in
Appendix A), which won him further recognition and promotion to the rank of
Acting Major.
After Canadas declaration of war, 10 September 1939, Simonds joined
1st Canadian Infantry Division as a General Staff Officer Grade 2 (GSO2)
responsible for operations and training. Subsequently during a brief tour as
Commanding Officer of 1st RCHA, he was selected to organize a Canadian Junior
War Staff College to prepare promising young officers for the rapidly expanding
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
2
army. Although this staff training was transferred to Canada after the first
fourteen-week course had been conducted, Simonds reputation was nonetheless
enhanced by his performance in organizing it. Subsequent service as GSO1 2nd
Division, where he worked effectively with the distinguished Great War veteran
Major-General Victor Odlum, won him promotion to the rank of Brigadier and an
appointment as Brigadier General Staff (BGS) 1st Canadian Corps.3
Simonds most important responsibility as Lieutenant-General Andrew
McNaughtons senior staff officer was to prepare the initial draft of an
Appreciation of Operation JUPITER a plan to seize enemy airfields in Northern
Norway. Prime Minister Winston Churchill pressed the idea upon his reluctant
Chiefs of Staff, and when their Joint Planning Committee reported that chances of
success were slight, Churchill entrusted the planning of Jupiter to General
McNaughton.4 General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of Imperial General Staff
(CIGS) promptly sent for McNaughton to inform him privately how matters
stood as I did not want him afterwards to imagine that the Canadians should
undertake an operation which we considered impracticable.5 McNaughton must
have relayed this information to Simonds, who prepared a detailed analysis and
concluded that the operation was extremely hazardous and would require very
large air, land and naval forces.
Simonds service as the senior staff officer at 1st Corps and briefly 1st
Canadian Army ended in September 1942 when he was given command of 1st
Infantry Brigade, a position he held until April 1943 when he was promoted
Major-General to command 2nd Infantry Division. Less than a month later,
Simonds replaced Major-General Harry Salmon, who was killed in a plane crash,
as General Officer Commanding, 1st Infantry Division.
The 1st Division was then in the midst of preparations for its role in
Operation HUSKY, the invasion of Sicily, and Simonds first task was to travel to
Egypt to be briefed on the plan for the assault phase of HUSKY. The Canadians
were to serve under the command of Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese in 30th
British Corps, and the corps BGS provided the outline of the new and firm plan
that called for landing two brigade groups on the western side of the Pachino
Peninsula. Simonds met with Leese and after further study of the map and model
put the [divisional] plan down on paper. He cabled it to London all within 24
hours of his arrival in Cairo.6
The Canadian landings in Sicily were largely unopposed, and Simonds
initial concern as divisional commander was the loss of vehicles, guns and signals
equipment to U-boats. Once battle was joined the division carried out a series of
tasks allotted to it by Corps headquarters. Simonds himself noted that no written
operational order was issued by his headquarters during the Sicily campaign.7
From Captain to Corps Commander
3
There is some debate about Simonds performance as a commander in
HUSKY and criticism of the style of his leadership8, but by the end of the
campaign both his corps commander and Montgomery were well pleased with
Simonds and his division. Leeses letter of 6 August 1943, written as the
Canadians were leaving his corps, went well beyond the conventional
congratulations to praise the divisions battle training and the manner in which
you handled your Division. He continued:
My whole staff tell me how extraordinarily well their opposite
numbers in your Division have done and how much they enjoyed
working with them. It has made the whole difference to us to
have had this very close and helpful co-operation with you. We
are all sad that you are leaving the corps.9
The 1st Canadian Division had been selected to participate in Operation
BAYTOWN, an assault across the Straits of Messina to secure a bridgehead on the
Italian mainland. Simonds held a planning conference on 24 August and his
verbal instructions were transcribed for the War Diary. The 13th British Corps,
commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Miles Dempsey, had issued the outline
plan and once again there was little the divisional commanders could do except fill
in the details.
Simonds described the purpose of BAYTOWN as the capture of a
beachhead so that the Straits of Messina would be free for the use of our
shipping. The secondary objective was to draw enemy resources against the
beachhead for a later operation to follow on a subsequent date. This reference to
AVALANCHE, the landings at Salerno, indicates that Simonds had been briefed
on the overall strategy for the campaign. This may explain his emphasis on
preparations for exploitation should enemy resistance prove to be weak. I will
not hesitate, he declared, to pool all transport on the shores to make one brigade
mobile and I may reduce the original assault brigades to nothing but a skeleton to
do so.10
The landings were again unopposed, but Montgomery and Dempsey were
in no hurry to press north, and the Canadians spent a frustrating week in the
Aspramonte before receiving orders to advance to Potenza. Simonds created a
mobile battle group, known as Boforce (after Lieutenant-Colonel Bogert, CO
West Nova Scotia Regiment), but before he could order it to strike for Potenza, a
vital road and rail junction east of Salerno, he had to determine Montgomerys
intentions. Writing to Dempsey on 17 September, he asked for clarification of the
somewhat vague plan his corps commander had outlined. I am not quite clear,
he wrote, as to whether it was now desirable to make military noises in that
direction as quickly as I can, or whether we should lie doggo until the whole
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
4
division is ready to advance. Given the desperate news from Salerno, Simonds
reported that he would rush Boforce to Potenza unless I hear from you to the
contrary.11 Dempsey agreed to the proposal and Potenza was quickly secured.
Simonds was deeply frustrated by the conduct of the mainland campaign,
and when Dempsey directed him to advance from Potenza to Foggia on two
widely separated axes, he raised serious objections to the orders in a detailed
letter12 that speaks to his growing confidence as an operational commander.
22 Sep 43
Dear [Lieutenant-General M.C. Dempsey]
1. Many thanks for your letter of 20 Sep 43. I will make a point of
passing your congratulatory remarks to the troops.
2. I now have two brigades and divisional troops (less details with 1 Cdn
Inf Bde) concentrated around Potenza and by 2000 hrs tonight the route
Rotondella-Potenza will be completed for all weather traffic.
3. I am continuing active patrolling on all roads radiating from Potenza
and, now the route on our left is open, I have given priority to the
reopening of the routes Potenza-Gravina and Potenza-Melfi in that order.
4. I see serious objections to locating 1 Cdn Inf Bde Gp in the Altamura-
Gravina area and the proposal subsequently to move on two axes
Potenza-Melfi-Foggia and Gravina-Spinazzola-Canosa-Foggia.
Measured on the map the distance from Potenza to Gravina is 30 miles.
Judging by our experience on those roads it will run to 60 or 70 miles as
the jeep goes (on the 1/250,000 map the distance Rotondella-Potenza
measures some 50 miles  it is 110 miles by road).
5. If I try to advance on a two brigade front on axes separated by 70
miles:-
(a) My wireless communications will not work over such a range
and I will have no communication with the right flanking brigade
other than by L.O. by road with about a 24-hr turn round. This is
quite hopeless in fluid operations where action must be quickly coordinated
and support readjusted. It is in no sense comparable to
the present situation of 1 Cdn Inf Bde which has a static role and is
close to our main forward axis.
(b) I will have to divide my support on two axes or leave the
flanking brigade without any.
From Captain to Corps Commander
5
(c) I will have to divide my engineer effort on two axes and in
addition have to open long and difficult laterals towards both flanks
instead of only one.
(d) I will have to make an administrative detachment resulting in
loss of administrative flexibility.
6. I consider advancing in a single division on such widely separated
axes objectionable from both a tactical and administrative point of view.
The alternative is to split the division and place the right flanking brigade
under command of another formation. This I believe to be contrary to the
Army Commanders fixed policy and I certainly consider it unsound
because the problem of dissipating the supporting arms and
administrative effort still remains.
7. I believe there are great advantages to operating the division on a two
brigade front providing that the frontage does not result in a loss of
control and the loss of the power to concentrate all resources in support
of a thrust along one axis. Our experience in Sicily and here is that if a
speedy advance is to be maintained along the divisional axis against
enemy rearguards, the artillery effort must be concentrated and if speed is
to be maintained in the face of demolitions only, then the engineer effort
must be concentrated.
8. I can see the advantages of placing a brigade wide on my right during
a period when we will be tapping out the enemy to the North and East by
active patrolling but I consider it should be within wireless range. The
recce I would place wider still and make responsible for the deep
patrolling.
9. If it is desirable to position a brigade in the Grivina-Altamura area
would it not be better to place there an Independent Brigade which has its
own allotment of supporting arms without cutting into those of a division
which in my opinion should always be position so that it is possible to
concentrate them quickly on a single thrust line. The lateral Brienza-
Potenza-Gravina will be through in a day or so. 5 Div with 231 Bde seem
to be in rather a cramped area. Would it not be possible to pass 231 Bde
across to the Gravina area?
10. I realize that the plans are still in a very formative stage but I feel I
should now represent:-
(a) That my communications, administrative, artillery and engineer
resources will NOT allow me to control a divisional battle on two
axes separated by some 70 miles.
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
6
(b) The alternative of splitting the division and its supporting
engineers and artillery to form a detached group, if we are working
forward to an offensive battle, I regard as unsound. If the enemy is
very soft it does not matter, but under such conditions recces can
do the wide flanking task better than a detached brigade.
11. Surely a strong thrust along the coast axis Bari-Foggia and another
strong divisional thrust on the axis Potenza-Foggia linked up by an
Independent Brigade, Armour or even Recce, in between will see the
enemy out of Foggia at short order. In the country through which we will
be moving I would have no worries about my left flank. With the 5th
Army pushing forward as I presume it would and with 5 Div echeloned
back to the left as I believe is your intention, full insurance will be
provided against any enemy threat on our western side.
12. The country about here is suitable for the employment of tanks and I
would like to have some remain with me  especially when we debouch
from the Melfi area into the Foggia plain.
13. I may have misunderstood your letter which referred to axes
Potenza-Melfi-Foggia and Gravina-Spinazzola-Canosa-Foggia. If the
axes are alternative, the difficulties I mentioned do not arise. If we
advance on the axis Gravina-Spinazzola-Canova-Foggia, I consider we
would need an Armoured Brigade to cover the advance insofar as the
country can be judged from small scale maps.
14. I would respectfully urge an early decision as to our axis because
with the present lack of good large or medium scale maps, photographic
strips covering a wide lane either side of the axis are really a necessity to
planning ahead.
Sincerely,
(G.G. Simonds)

Simonds fell ill with jaundice shortly after sending this letter. After his
return, Simonds again questioned Dempseys orders asking for a brigade from 5th
British Division or the return of the 14th Tank Regiment (the Calgary Regiment)
to form a firm base as 2nd Cdn Inf Bde moves forward.13 Before matters could
develop further, Simonds was informed that he was to take command of the 5th
Armoured Division, which, together with 1st Canadian Corps Headquarters, was
to arrive in Italy during November 1943. This decision removed Simonds from
command of 1st Division one month before it was committed to the major battles
for the Moro River, the gully and Ortona, battles that might well have benefited
from his experience.
The lateral transfer to 5th Division was intended to give Simonds
experience with an armoured division before he was promoted to Lieutenant-
General and given command of 2nd Canadian Corps. Crerar, who was trying to
gain personal credibility as a corps commander in Italy before assuming command
of First Canadian Army, failed to explain his intentions, and Simonds initially
believed he was being shunted aside. This may have influenced his decision to
ignore medical advice and return to full duty before he was ready. His erratic and
paranoid behaviour in confrontations with Crerar, his superior officer, was almost
certainly due to the lingering effects of jaundice. Crerar, acting with remarkable
forbearance, continued to endorse Simonds as the best choice to command 2nd
Canadian Corps.14
Simonds reached England in early January and assumed command of the
corps later in the month. With 3rd Infantry Division and 2nd Armoured Brigade
under 1st British Corps for the Normandy invasion Simonds command consisted
of the 2nd Infantry Division, 4th Armoured Division and corps troops. On
2 February he addressed his officers and reportedly told them, there are some of
you in whom I have not much confidence. I will see you tomorrow and tell you
why.15 Among those found wanting were the chief engineer (CRE), the
commander of Royal Artillery (CRA) and the senior medical officer (DDMS).
Simonds kept Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Moncel, the GSO1 who had been the
outstanding student in his 1942 staff college course, but a number of other staff
officers were reassigned.
SimondsWeekly Progress Reports to Canada reflect the intensity of the
training regime and his determination to find the right combination of senior
officers. On 19 February, Brigadier N.E. Rodgers arrived to take over duties as
BGS, and Brigadier Geoffrey Walsh, DSO [Distinguished Service Order] was
appointed CRE. A week later the report noted that Maj. Gen G. Kitching, DSO
assumed command of 4th Canadian Armoured Division. New brigadiers were
appointed to command all four infantry brigades in the corps. On 17 March
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
8
Brigadier Bruce Matthews, DSO, who had served Simonds well as 1st Division
CRA, arrived to take over the artillery responsibilities at Corps.16 Matthews
shared Simonds conviction that artillery was the armys principal weapon and that
his job was to ensure that when the medium artillery of 2nd Canadian Army Group
Royal Artillery (AGRA) became available it would comprise a seamless artillery
plan.
Simonds, who knew the value of close tank-infantry co-operation from
direct experience in Sicily, was concerned that the infantry battalions in 2nd
Division had little experience working with armour, and on 27 April he ordered
4th Armoured Brigade to detach squadrons for a period of two weeks to give
infantry experience in working with tanks.17 The decision to mount the
Normandy invasion with one independent tank brigade for every two infantry
divisions was a serious weakness that Simonds could not overcome.
The 2nd Canadian Corps was scheduled to move to the continent and
enter battle to participate in a breakout from an established bridgehead. It was
Simonds responsibility to ensure the corps was ready for such operations, and on
7 February he held his first Training Conference, attended by all divisional and
brigade commanders, the Commanding Officers (COs) of artillery regiments, the
GSO1s, as well as corps and divisional administrative (AA&QMG) or logistics
officers. Two days later, 4th Canadian Armoured Division began a four-day
scheme designed to exercise formations, arty commanders and staffs in
movement, allotment and control of artillery and the production of a divisional fire
plan. The divisional artillery was required to practice counter-battery
organization as well as full scale movement and deployment. Exercise
CONQUEROR, a more limited study of a set-piece attack on a strongly defended
enemy position, allowed Simonds to observe Major-General Charles Foulkes,

RECONNAISSANCE BATTALION
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
SECTION I
GENERAL
E 1 . PURPOSE.-a. The purpose of this manual is to outline
general methods of training and employing the reconnaissance
battalion of the armored division . Tactical employment
of the reconnaissance company is covered in
FM 17-20, and that of the tank company In FM 17-32 . The
subject of reconnaissance in general is covered in FM 100-5
and FM 17-10 .
b. This manual is intended as a guide only . It is not
expected that it will be followed blindly . Rigid application
of a fixed set of rules is liighly undesirable . Each situation
must be solved on its own merits . Individual initiative must
be encouraged .
c . Following is a key to symbols used in illustrations in this
manual

â 2. MIssIoN .-a. The primary mission of the reconnaissance
battalion is, In conjunction with observation aviation,
to furnish the division commander with Information upon
which to base a decision for employment of the division .
1
FM 17-22
1-2
2 -5
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
Before any other mission is assigned, a careful estimate
should be made as to the probable effect on this primary
mission.
b . Additional missions that may be assigned are counterreconnaissance,
security, and combat. The reconnaissance
battalion is not given the mission of covering development
of the division or its elements, Such mission would interfere
seriously with the primary mission of reconnaissance . Such
covering is incidental to reconnaissance and counterreconnaissance
.
â 3, SUPPORT, a. Depending upon its mission, terrain, width
of zone, and the enemy situation, the reconnaissance battalion
may be reinforced by engineers, infantry, artillery,
tank destroyers, and air bombardment . Observation aviation
attached to an armored division habitually cooperates
with the reconnaissance battalion .
b . When numerous streams are to be crossed and the terrain
is otherwise difficult, one or more companies of engineers
should be attached,
c. When the battalion is given counterreconnaissance, security,
or combat missions, infantry and artillery may be
attached. Combat aviation if available, should be in support .
d, When the reconnaissance battalion is given a mission
of seizing and holding critical points it should be relieved at
the earliest practicable moment by other troops in order
that it may perform its primary mission of reconnaissance .
â 4 . ORGANIZATION.-The battalion is composed of a battalion
headquarters and headquarters company, three reconnaissance
companies, and a tank company . For details of
organization see current Tables of Organization .
8 5. METHOD OF EMPLOYMENT .-a, The reconnaissance battalion
operates under direct orders of the division commander .
Rarely will it or any of its elements be attached to other
units of the division, as this will dissipate its strength .
b. Clearly defined missions must be assigned. If two or
more missions are assigned, the primary mission must be
indicated .
c. A zone of reconnaissance is assigned . This varies with
the terrain, road net, mission, and enemy situation . A zone
2
RECONNAISSANCE BATTALION
5-7
30 to 50 miles in width may be reconnoitered at a speed of
10 to 15 miles per hour. (See FM 17-10 and FM 17-20 .)
d. The battalion may reconnoiter as far as 150 miles in
front of the division . This distance, however, will be exceptional
. Normally the reconnaissance battalion will not precede
the division by more than 100 miles,
SECTION II
TRAINING
8 6. GENERAL.-a. Tactical training of the battalion as a
whole commences near the end of the company training
period. The company should have completed each phase of
training as listed below before such phase is scheduled for
battalion training . During company training periods the
battalion commander and his staff, in addition to supervising
training, prepare tactical exercises for the battalion .
Battalion headquarters should hold frequent command post
exercises . Combined operations with other units, air, infantry,
tank, artillery, tank destroyer, and engineer, should be
held when practicable .
b . The battalion as a whole, in addition to company training
(see FM 17-20), should be trained in-
Marches.
Security .
Collection of information and reports .
Offensive action .
Defensive action,
Retrograde movements .
Special operations .
E 7. PROCEDURE .-a . To be of value in training, exercises must
be carefully planned and vigorously executed . Plans for an
exercise must be made well in advance and not left to the
last moment . (See FM 21-5 .)
b . The following is a guide to steps taken in preparation
of field exercises :
(1) Decide upon the type of exercise (par . 6) and the particular
points of such exercise that are to be emphasized .
(2) Make a map reconnaissance to determine suitable
terrain for the exercise and find out if that terrain is available
at the time desired .
3
7-8
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(3) Plan the exercise on the map. Make a terrain reconnaissance
of the area . Next, with the staff, war-game the
exercise on the map until satisfied that the situation is sound
and that the points to be emphasized will be brought out .
(4) The exercise should then be played as a war game
by the battalion commander, his staff, and the company
officers. At this time company commanders and, junior
officers should be required to' make decisions and issue orders .
Interest is maintained by injecting various small situations
requiring immediate decision and action .
(5) The exercise is next played on the terrain . Before
proceeding in the exercise, make sure that all equipment
and personnel are complete as far as available. From the
time the unit moves from the vehicle park until the end of
the problem, each individual must understand that he is to
act as though he were under actual combat conditions . Toleration
of any laxity will invariably lead to poor performance
in the exercise and a consequent loss in training time .
(6) After the exercise, hold a critique at which the exercise
is explained. Bring out the good and bad points of performance
. Where solutions were in error point out a correct
solution . Do not try to hold to one solution if others may
be equally good. Care must be taken not to ridicule the work
of individuals .
c . In all problems try to inject realism . Whenever possible
use a two-sided maneuver . In any case outline the enemy
position with small groups,
SECTION III
CONTROL, ORDERS, LIAISON
>t 6 . CONTROL.-Control is exercised by giving definite orders,
by use of radio and messengers, and by use of zones, boundaries,
axis of advance, and phase lines .
(t . Radio,-(1) The battalion is amply equipped with long
and short range radio sets for communication within the
battalion, to higher headquarters, and with supporting air
units .
(2) When voice radio is used, and it is used for all short
distance radio communication, the commander or his staff
4

officers must use it in person . For long range operation,
messages are sent by key and usually in code .
(3) Figure 1 shows the battalion radio net . By use of
different crystals these nets may be changed to meet any
situation .
F5
FIGURE 1 .-Radio nets, reconnaissance battalion .
(4) Strict radio discipline must be maintained . Messages
must be brief .
(5) For radio identification codes see current Signal
Operations Instructions . FM 17-20 also covers radio Identification
codes,
(6) Do not send orders or information in the clear when the
information to be transmitted, if intercepted by the enemy,

can be acted upon in time to influence the situation in question.
Do not send messages in code and repeat any part
in the clear, Brevity codes may be used for certain messages
. For rules governing radioo security, see FM 24-5 .
b. Messengers .-Use messengers for short distances, as
they will be faster than radio, There are only a few messengers
in the battalion headquarters, so use them sparingly.
A messenger sent to division headquarters 50 miles
away will probably not return within 4 hours .
c . Panels and pick-up and drop messages .-(1) The use
of pick-up and drop messages is convenient for transmission
of overlays, maps, and aerial photographs . The slowflying
liaison airplane is valuable for this service . Do not
have the pick-up field near the CP. The enemy observation
may find it . For use of panels see FM 24-5 .
(2) When radio silence is essential, when radio communication
has broken down, or when it is necessary to identify
location of the CP or pick-up field to the air observer, panels
may he used .
d. Zones, boundaries, axis of advance .-Direction and lateral
extent of movement is controlled by designation of zones
of advance and boundaries, or by giving an axis of advance
and a frontage . The division commander designates a zone
for the battalion . The battalion commander divides the zone
into zones for his companies . (See fig . 4 .)
e. Phase lines .-The rate of advance is controlled and coordination
is obtained by designating phase lines and report
lines. These are easily identified terrain features on
the route of advance . The battalion commander prescribes
the time leading elements of the companies will pass the
phase lines . Companies report when they reach and pass
a phase line .
1 9. ORDERS.-a. Orders are usually oral. They may be, and
usually are, supplemented by use of marked maps, overlays,
or aerial photographs . A sketch such as figure 4 might well
be issued as part of the order for an advance . Orders follow
the form given in FM 101-5 . They must be short and clear .
Missions must be unmistakably stated,
b. Clear orders are necessary for correct execution. Every
officer must strive by continuous practice to make himself
9
9-10
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
perfect in the issuance of such orders . Thorough training
in this subject should be given during the war game period
of preparing tactical problems .
E 10 . LIAIsoN.-a. The use of liaison officers must be habitual .
Reconnaissance battalion headquarters has one liaison officer
who remains at division headquarters . This officer must
know the plans of the battalion commander . He must keep
the battalion commander informed of any changes in division
plans . His duties are prescribed in FM 101-5 .
b. Each combat command sends one liaison officer to the
CP of the reconnaissance battalion . This officer must know
the plans of the combat command commander . He keeps this
commander informed on the situation as found by the reconnaissance
battalion . He should have a radio set for communication
with the combat command and should also be
provided with messengers .
c. The reconnaissance company of the armored regiments
should maintain liaison personnel at the CP of the reconnaissance
battalion . This also applies to the infantry regiment
when it is leading the division . As the combat com=
mand closes on the reconnaissance battalion, its liaison party
joins that company of the reconnaissance battalion in the
zone of advance of the combat command. When the regimental
reconnaissance company operating with the combat
command closes on the reconnaissance battalion, the liaison
party joins the company commander and furnishes him all
information available .
d. Artillery liaison officers from the combat commands
should also join the reconnaissance battalion and remain with
it until the combat command closes on the reconnaissance
battalion. By this means the artillery will gain early information
of positions, terrain, and targets . The liaison officer
is also able to give necessary information to any supporting
artillery that may be detailed to assist the reconnaissance
battalion .
e. The engineer reconnaissance platoon of the headquarters
company, engineer battalion, accompanies the reconnaissance
battalion . It performs reconnaissance and liaison
functions .

SECTION IV
MAINTENANCE
0 11, GENERAL,Each company of the reconnaissance battalion
has a maintenance section which performs second
echelon maintenance for the company . In addition, the
battalion headquarters company has a maintenance platoon
which performs second echelon maintenance for the battalion
as a whole . The battalion may be reinforced by elements of
the division maintenance battalion . In combat the distinction
between echelons of maintenance is slight, Each maintenance
unit does such work, with the tools, spare parts, and
mechanics available, as time and the tactical situation permit.
Company maintenance will not undertake work so
extensive that service to a large number of other vehicles
is prevented . Vehicles must be kept r olling. FM 17-50 covers
in general the subject of maintenance,
12 . BATTALION MAINTENANCE PLATOON This platoon is organized
into a platoon headquarters, two maintenance sections,
a maintenance section (trains), and a wrecker section .
When the battalion is advancing, with two companies leading,
a maintenance section is assigned to each of the two
leading companies. When three reconnaissance companies
are leading, the train section will service the center company .
1 13 . MAINTENANCE PLAN.-a. Before starting an operation,
the battalion commander, after acquainting his staff with
plans for employment of the battalion, calls upon the maintenance
officer for a plan of maintenance . The plan is based
upon a maintenance estimate of the situation which
includes-
(1) Probable enemy resistance.-If enemy resistance is expected
to be heavy, maintenance needs will be high . If resistance
is expected to be light, maintenance needs will
probably be low .
(2) Terrain,Rough terrain will increase maintenance
needs .
(3) Width of zone.-If the zone of advance is wide, the
work of maintenance detachments will be made difficult,
owing to the long distances which they must travel to reach
disabled vehicles .
11
21-23
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
some protection from the enemy . However, the battalion
must provide for its own security . The reserve reconnaissance
company furnishes the outpost .
b. Security in bivouac is obtained by-
(1) Taking advantage of natural barriers such as wide
streams, swamps, lakes, or extremely mountainous country .
(2) Detail of an outpost, (See FM 17-10 and FM 17-20 .)
c. When practicable, select bivouac in daylight, move billeting
parties in and occupy bivouac after dark; the enemy
may observe these movements in daylight .
d . Make sure a definite system of recognition is in effect.
Supply vehicles, kitchens, vehicles for evacuation of wounded,
and messengers will be moving in and out all night. (See
FM 17-20.)
e, Security from air attack is obtained by concealment,
dispersion, and use of available weapons . Do not fire at hostile
airplanes unless attacked or unless sure your location has
already been discovered, as, this will disclose your position .
Dig slit trenches for protection .
SECTION VII
INFORMATION AND REPORTS
â¢ 22 . GENERAL. Information, no matter how accurate, is
useless if not placed in the hands of the commander in time
to be evaluated . Therefore, there must be a systematic and
fast method of recording information and transmitting it
to division CP.
â¢ 23. INFORMATION SOUGHT .-All information which may be
of any value to the commander must be sought and reported.
FM 17-10 lists specific items of information which should be
obtained . In general, information required isa
. Location of the enemy, his flanks, disposition, composition,
direction of movement, strength .
b. Location of gaps or weak points In enemy defense .
c . Confirmation of information obtained by air observation,
d. Identifications .
e. Terrain, such as obstacles, cover, concealment, ground
suitable for tanks, ground suitable for dismounted men only,
impassable ground.
3 2
RECONNAISSANCE BATTALION
24-27
â¢ 24. COLLECTING AND RECORDING INFORMATION .-Collection
and transmission of information by reconnaissance companies,
is covered in FM 17-20 . At reconnaissance battalion
headquarters, information is recorded and evaluated to some
extent . However, information which may appear of little
or no value may be of great value to the division G-2 when
evaluated in conjunction with information received from
other sources .
â¢ 25. TRANSMITTAL OF INFORMATION,-The division G-2 may
designate which information is to be transmitted at once
and which is to be sent in periodic reports . This may be
covered in standing operating procedure . Should this not
be indicated, then the battalion commander must decide .
Usually information of first contact with the enemy, any
large body of troops encountered, and any terrain information
which is vital to the division commander in his plan of
employment is transmitted at once . For methods of transmitting
information, see paragraph 8 .
SECTION VIII
OFFENSIVE COMBAT
126. GENERAL.-Offensive combat in general is covered in
FM 100-5. To gain information, the reconnaissance battalion
must act quickly and aggressively . It must be prepared to
fight for information . In addition to the armored cars, it
has a tank company which it may use to overcome enemy
counterreconnaissance or to repel an enemy attack.
â¢
27. ADVANCE TO CONTACT,--a. Zones, boundaries, axis of
advance, and phase lines are covered in paragraph 8 .
b. As the battalion advances in its zone, increasing enemy
resistance usually is met. Reconnaissance companies spread
out and seek the enemy's flanks and rear, constantly reporting
the situation to the battalion headquarters .
c. When the hostile covering force can be penetrated, the
reconnaissance elements feel out and determine the enemy
dispositions. They seek weak spots in the enemy defenses .
The reserve reconnaissance company may be committed to
move around the enemy flanks to his rear areas .

RECONNAISSANCE BATTALION
27-28
d. When the enemy flanks are unassailable and his covering
forces cannot be penetrated by reconnaissance elements, a
weak place in the covering force is sought . The reconnaissance
battalion commander then attacks through this weak
spot with his tank company, supported by air bombardment
and artillery, if available . Available assault guns of the
reserve reconnaissance company and of reconnaissance platoons
near the point of attempted penetration support the
tank company attack . The reserve reconnaissance company
moves through behind the tank company and proceeds to
feel out the enemy main defenses. The tank company seeks
to destroy the covering forces, thus permitting other reconnaissance
elements to advance .
â 28. COOPERATION WITn REGIMENTAL RECONNAISSANCE .-AS
combat commands close on the reconnaissance battalion,
liaison details from regimental reconnaissance companies join
their reconnaissance units . These units make detailed terrain
reconnaissance and contact elements of the reconnaissance
battalion in their zone . They may relieve elements
of the -reconnaissance battalion, thus permitting the battalion
to extend reconnaissance farther to the flanks . How-
FIGURE 23,-Operation when exploiting a penetration made by
other troops,

FIGURE 24. Envelopment .
RECONNAISSANCE BATTALION
28-32
ever, such maneuver usually is impractical, and regimental
reconnaissance companies may move to the flanks or be
placed in division reserve . When the reconnaissance battalion
is employed over a large front, regimental reconnaissance
companies may take over part of the front .
â¢ 29, ACTION IN A PENETRATION,-a . When passed through by
assaulting troops, the battalion is reorganized and follows
the last echelon of attack, ready to move out on reconnaissance
missions when the penetration has been made .
b . When the division passes through a gap in the hostile
line to exploit a penetration made by other troops, the reconnaissance
battalion leads .
â¢ 30. ENVELOPMENT,-a . When the division attacks by envelopment
of one flank, the bulk of the reconnaissance battalion
reconnoiters on the exposed flank and seeks enemy vital
installations .
b . When the division attacks by double envelopment, the
battalion operates on both flanks .
â¢ 31, SEIZING CRITICAL AREAS .In offense, the reconnaissance
battalion may be given the mission of seizing and holding a
critical area until the arrival of other troops . It may be given
the mission of moving forward rapidly to assist paratroops
in holding such areas . The battalion moves swiftly to these
areas, fighting to obtain them if necessary . It must be relieved
as soon as practicable .
132, PURSUIT.When the division engages in a pursuit, the
reconnaissance battalion operates with the encircling force .
It gains contact with the retreating columns ; operates on their
flanks : locates routes that will permit reaching the heads of
these enemy columns ; finds and reports on routes that will
enable the encircling force to avoid obstacles and hostile
security elements; and locates key positions from which the
encircling force may operate against the heads of the retreating
enemy columns, and thus facilitate the destruction of the
enemy by the direct pressure forces . This reconnaissance
during a pursuit must be pushed with great vigor, (See also
FM 100-5.)

RECONNAISSANCE BATTALION
33-36
SECTION IX
DEFENSIVE ACTION AND RETROGRADE MOVEMENTS
133, GENERAL .-In defense, the primary mission of the battalion
is to detect the strength and direction of movement of
the enemy . As the enemy approaches, the battalion may be
assigned a counterreconnaissance mission.
â¢ 34 . COUNTERRECONNAISSANCE The width of the counterreconnaissance
zone will vary with the terrain and the road
net. Normally no more than nine roads can be covered . For
counterreconnaissance missions the regimental reconnaissance
companies and one or more light tank companies may
be attached to the reconnaissance battalion .
. 35. DEFENSE OF A POSITION,-When the division is engaged
in defending a position, the reconnaissance battalion, reinforced
as necessary, contacts the enemy, reports his strength
and movements, and performs counterreconnaissance missions.
It may fight a delaying action to give the defenders
time to organize positions . It withdraws along previously
reconnoitered routes . It seeks to lead the enemy into a false
conception of the defensive position, and deceives him as to
its extent and strength . For this mission the battalion may
be reinforced with artillery . It is reinforced with engineers
for performing demolition work . The battalion then reconnoiters
to the flanks and prepares to resume the offensive or
to protect a withdrawal,
136. RETROGRADE In a retrograde movement, the reconnaissance
battalion operates on the hostile flanks to establish
road blocks, and to locate, harass, and delay hostile pursuing
forces, Withdrawal must be effected before becoming too
closely engaged . The delaying force must be kept constantly
informed of the progress of the hostile troops . Contact is
maintained and enemy progress reported by elements of reconnaissance
companies observing the hostile route of march
from positions along the flanks . These detachments harass
the enemy by firing into the flank of the hostile force and
quickly retiring to other points of observation . During a
retrograde movement, there will be frequent opportunities
41
36-37
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
for elements of the reconnaissance battalion to prepare well .
planned ambushes into which enemy troops, especially security
groups, can be drawn and then annihilated. The tank
company may be used with the delaying force, or may move on
routes parallel to the hostile route, prepared to crush enemy
security forces or other small groups . Unit commanders will
ordinarily be given mission type orders in an action of this
nature . Every means of communication will be used to effect
coordination and control . Air cooperation is invaluable in
maintaining hostile and friendly contact and In reporting
targets of opportunity . This cooperation is not restricted
to observation aviation but envisages the utmost use of combat
aviation to operate against the heads of enemy columns
and reconnaissance elements .

WASHINGTON May 22 94
FM 00-5 Field Service Regulations Operations is published
for the information and guidance of all concerned
It contains the doctrines of leading troops in combat and
tactics of the combined arms and constitutes the basis of
instruction of all arms and services for field service Additional
doctrines pertaining to the defense of coast lines and
landing operations on hostile shores are discussed in other
manuals
Field Service Regulations will be interpreted in the light of
FM 27- 0 Rules of Land Warfare FM 04-5 Field Service
Regulations Operations should be studied in connection with
FM 00- 0 Field Service Regulations Administration and
FM 00- 5 Field Service Regulations Larger Units
While the fundamental doctrines of combat operations are
neither numerous nor complex their application is sometimes
difficult Knowledge of these doctrines and experience in their
application provide all commanders a firm basis for action in
a particular situation This knowledge and experience enable
the commander to utilize the flexible organization with which
he is provided to group his forces into task units most suitable
for the accomplishment of his mission
Set rules and methods must be avoided They limit imagination
and initiative which are so important in the successful
prosecution of war They provide the enemy a fixed pattern
of operations which he can more easily counter
It is a function of command to coordinate the tactics and
technique of the various arms and services so as to develop
in the forces employed on a given task the teamwork essential
to success

THE EXERCISE OF COMMAND
DOCTRINES OF COMBAT
The ultimate objective of all military operations is
the destruction of the enemy's armed forces in battle The
ability to select objectives whose attainment contributes most
decisively and quickly to the defeat of the hostile armed farces
is one attribute of the able commander
â¢ 3 Simple and direct plans and methods with prompt and
thorough execution are often decisive in the attainment of
success
â¢ 4 Unity of command obtains that unity of effort which
is essential to the decisive application of full combat power
of the available forces Unity of effort is furthered by full
cooperation between elements of the command
s 5 Through offensive action a commander exercises his
initiative preserves his freedom of action and imposes his
will on the enemy A defensive attitude may however be
deliberately adopted as a temporary expedient while awaiting
an opportunity for counteroffensive action or for the purpose
of economizing forces on a front where a decision is not
sought The selection by the commander of the right time
and place for offensive action is a decisive factor in the success
of the operation
Numerical inferiority does not necessarily commit a command
to a defensive attitude Superior hostile numbers may
be overcome through greater mobility better armament and
equipment more effective fire higher morale and better
leadership Superior leadership often enables a numerically
inferior force to be stronger at the point of decisive action
A strategically defensive mission is frequently mast effectively
executed through offensive action It is often necessary
for an inferior force to strike at an early moment in
order to secure initial advantages or to prevent itself from
being overwhelmed by a growing superiority in the hostile
forces
22
OPERATIONS
6- 9
â¢ 6 Concentration of superior forces both on the ground
and in the air at the decisive place and time and their employment
in a decisive direction creates the conditions
essential to victory Such concentration requires strict economy
in the strength of forces assigned to secondary missions
Detachments during combat are justifiable only when
the execution of tasks assigned them contributes directly
to success in the main battle
7 Surprise must be sought throughout the action by
every means and by every echelon of command It may be
obtained by fire as well as by movement Surprise is produced
through measures which either deny information to
the enemy or positively deceive him as to our dispositions
movements and plans Terrain which appears to impose
great difficulties on operations may often be utilized to gain
surprise Surprise is furthered by variation in the means
and methods employed in combat and by rapidity of
execution
Surprise often compensates for numerical inferiority of
force
Surprise finds the enemy in a state of mental moral or
physical unpreparedness Every effort should be made to
deny him time to take effective countermeasures The effect
of surprise may be lost through dilatory methods of execution
â¢ 8 To guard against surprise requires a correct estimate
of enemy capabilities adequate security measures effective
reconnaissance and readiness for action of all units Every
unit takes the necessary measures for its own local ground
and air security Provision for the security of flanks and
rear is of especial importance
COMMAND
â¢ 9 Command is the authority which an individual in the
military service lawfully exercises over subordinates by virtue
of rank or assignment
Command and leadership are inseparable Whether the
force is large or small whether the functions of command are
complex or simple the commander must be the controlling
head; his must be the master mind and from him must flow
the energy and the impulse which are to animate all under
him
23
20- 24
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
20 Decision as to a specific course of action is the responsibility
of the commander alone While he may accept advice
and suggestions from any of his subordinates he alone
is responsible for what his unit does or fails to do
â 2 A willingness to accept responsibility is the foremost
trait of leadership Every individual from the highest commander
to the lowest private must always remember that inaction
and neglect of opportunities will warrant more severe
censure than an error of judgment in the action taken /The
criterion by which a commander judges the soundness of his
own decision is whether it will further the intentions of the
higher commander / Willingness to accept responsibility must
not manifest itself in a disregard of orders on the basis of a
mere probability of having a better knowledge of the situation
than the higher commander The subordinate unit is a part
of a tactical team employed by the higher commander to
accomplish a certain mission and any independence on the
part of a subordinate commander must conform to the general
plan for the unit as a whole
22 The commander's mission is contained in the orders
which he has received Nevertheless a commander of a
subordinate unit cannot plead absence of orders or the nonreceipt
of orders as an excuse for inactivity in a situation
where action on his part is essential or where a change in
the situation upon which the issued orders were based renders
such orders impracticable or impossible of execution If the
situation does not permit communication with the superior
commander and the subordinate commander is familiar with
the general plan of operations or the mission of the whole
command he should take appropriate action and report the
situation as early as practicable
23 The situations that confront a commander in war are
of infinite variety In spite off the most careful planning and
anticipation unexpected obstacles frictions and mistakes are
common occurrences in battle A commander must school
himself to regard these events as cgmmonplace and not permit
them to frustrate him in the accomplishment of his mission
â 24 Personal conferences between the higher commander
and his subordinates who are to execute his orders may at
times be advisable that the latter may arrive at a correct
24
I
OPERATIONS
24- 28
understanding of the-plans and intentions of their superior
Commanders do not justify their decisions to subordinates
nor do they seek the approval of subordinates for their
actions
â¢ 25 All the troops assigned to the execution of a distinct
mission should be placed under one command to function as
a task force for the duration of the operation So long as a
commander can exercise effective command he does not disturb
the established chain of command in his force In some
situations conditions dictate that attachments must be made
to subordinate commands Such attachments may be necessary
in marches during periods of development in rapidly
changing situations or in the later stages of any action and
in general when better support or coordination can be
effected
â¢ 26 A commander who is advanced to a higher command
should be relieved from the responsibility of direct command
of his former unit
ESTIMATE Of THE SITUATION
â¢ 27 In any tactical operation the commander must
quickly evaluate all the available information bearing on his
task estimate the situation and reach a decision
â¢ 28 The commander's estimate of the situation is based on
the mission of the unit the means available to him and to the
enemy the conditions in his area of operations including
terrain and weather and the probable effects of various lines
of action on future operations (See FM 0 -5 ) On the basis
of these factors he considers the lines of action open to him
which if successful will accomplish his mission and the
lines of action of which the enemy is physically capable and
which can interfere with such accomplishment He analyzes
the opposing lines of action one against another to arrive at
conclusions as to the probability of success for each of his
own lines of action On the basis of this analysis he then considers
the relative advantages and disadvantages of his own
lines of action and selects that line of action which most
promises success regardless of what the enemy may do If
two or more lines of action appear equally promising he
chooses that one which will most favor future action
25
29- 33
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â¢ 29 The estimate often requires rapid thinking with consideration
limited to essential factors In campaign exact
conclusions concerning the enemy can seldom be drawn
To delay action in an emergency because of insufficient information
shows a lack of energetic leadership and may
result in lost opportunities The commander must take
calculated risks
â¢ 30 In considering the enemy's possible lines of action
the commander must guard against the unwarranted belief
that he has discovered the enemy's intentions and against
ignoring other lines of action open to the enemy Even when
the weight of evidence warrants the belief that the enemy
is committed to a definite line of action the commander
must bear in mind that a change in the enemy's plans may
occur at any time
â¢ 3 Because of their great mobility and rapid striking
power the capabilities of the opposing air and armored
forces and the possible effect of their employment must be
continually evaluated In estimating the capabilities of air
armored and motorized forces both friendly and hostile
the commander must be provided with full and up-to-date
information on the existing and probable future weather
conditions and their effect both ground and air on employment
of such forces
â¢ 32 The estimate of the situation culminates in the decision
A decision once made Is not changed without some
compelling reason In combat the will and energy of the
commander must persist until the mission is accomplished
Estimation of the situation is however a continuous process
and changed conditions may at any time call for a new
decision Too stubborn an adherence to a previous decision
may result in costly delay loss of opportunity for decisive
action or outright failure
TERRAIN
â¢ 33 That part of the commander's estimate dealing with
terrain often exercises a decisive influence upon his decision
and plan Proper evaluation and utilization of the terrain
reduce the disadvantage of incomplete information of the
enemy The more important features to be considered in
evaluating terrain include not only natural ground forms
such as mountains ridges streams bodies of water woods
26
OPERATIONS
33- 36
and open spaces but also artificial features such as roads
railroads and towns The commander seeks always to
utilize the terrain to his own advantage and to the enemy's
disadvantage
â¢ 34 While the mission of a force is the basic factor in the
commander's estimate this may frequently be resolved into
terms of terrain Thus in the defense it may be vital to
hold certain dominating ground or to protect a certain defile
Similarly in the offense success may hinge on the capture
of such features which then become the immediate objective
of the attack Where possible it is an aid to proper evaluation
of the terrain to reduce the mission to terms of terrain
â¢ 35 Maps are the basis for terrain studies but should be
checked by air reconnaissance 'air photographs and ground
reconnaissance Map errors must be expected Moreover
changes in the terrain especially in the road-net and drainage
system occur continually
â¢ 36 Terrain can always be evaluated in terms of the following
five factors : observation fields of fire concealment
and cover obstacles and routes of communication
a Observation of the battlefield is essential in order to
bring effective fire to bear upon the enemy to control the
maneuver of one's own troops and to prevent surprise by the
enemy It is obtained from commanding elevations
b Fields of fire are essential to the defense On the offensive
the commander seeks to make his main attack in areas
lacking in good fields of fire to the defender Best fields of
fire are found in level or uniformly sloping streches of open
ground
c Concealment and cover may occur together Concealment
is protection against observation from the ground and
air Cover is protection against fire The ideal defensive
position is one having concealment and cover within but none
in front of it The attack is best favored by terrain affording
good concealment throughout the depth of the advance
Concealment and cover from ground weapons are to be
found in broken wooded terrain
d Obstacles are terrain features which impede the movement
of military forces They are of increasing importance
in modern warfare where masses of mechanized units are employed
Although chiefly of advantage to the defense they
3 62660-4 -3
27
36- 37
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
may be of great importance in protecting the flanks of attacking
units Some of the common terrain obstacles are
mountains rivers bodies of water marshes gullies steep inclines
and extensive woods
e Routes of communication include roads railrogds waterways
and airways and their facilities They are important
in both offensive and defensive operations for the movement
of troops and supplies Troops in small bodies move across
country readily but in the operations of large bodies of troops
routes of communication are of vital importance
5 37 Features such as bridges streams woods and towns
divide practically all terrain into more or less separate areas
Such an area frequently consists of a valley lying between
two ridges or an open space between two woods When the
terrain features enclosing the area prevent direct fire and
observation into it from positions outside the area is called a
compartment
A compartment of which the longer axis extends in the direction
of movement of a force or leads toward or into a
defensive position is called a corridor In -general a corridor
favors the attack because it limits observation and direct
fire from the flanks by the defender From the standpoint of
terrain it is desirable that boundaries between tactical units
in the attack should coincide generally with the boundaries
of corridors in order that a single unit may control the terrain
features from which direct fire can be brought to bear on
troops within the corridor
In the defense boundaries are usually located within corridors
To assure unity of defensive dispositions the boundary
within the corridor should be so located as to include within
the sector of a tactical unit of appropriate size avenues of
approach to the position To locate boundaries within an
avenue of approach divides responsibility at critical areas
A compartment which extends across the direction of
movement of a force or which extends parallel with a defensive
front is called a cross-corridor Cross-corridors favor
the defense However ridge lines perpendicular to the direction
of advance permit an attacker to deal successively with
elements of the hostile position During the advance these
crests offer the attacker facilities for observation and fire as
well as shelter behind which he may reorganize his units

CONDUCT IN BATTLE
39 The commander's decision for his unit as a whole and
the missions to subordinate units in support of the decision
are communicated to subordinates by clear and concise orders
which gives them freedom of action appropriate to their
professional knowledge to the situation to their dependability
and to the teamplay desired
40 After providing for the issuance of orders the commander
places himself where he can best control the course
of action and exert his leadership His command post affords
the advantage of established signal communication When
opportunity offers and when his presence at the command post
is not urgently required he visits his subordinate commanders
and his troops in order to inspire confidence and to assure
himself that his orders are understood and properly executed
â¢ 4 Whenever the commander leaves his command post
he should orient his staff as to further plans to be made or
measures to be taken in anticipation of future contingencies
and should inform his staff where he can be reached
â¢
42 During the decisive phase of battle the place of the
commander is near the critical point of action
â¢ 43 A commander influences the course of subsequent
action by his leadership by the use of his reserves by the
concentration of artillery and other supporting fires and by
the employment of combat aviation and armored units
44 The duration of a tactical operation can seldom be
predicted Successful engagements sometimes progress so
slowly that the gains made are not immediately apparent
At other times they progress so fast that the gains made can
be capitalized only by the most aggressive and farsighted
leadership
Troops are used up rapidly in the decisive phases of combat
This attrition must be anticipated by the commander
and his staff who take timely measures for replacement of
men units transport and weapons and for replenishment
of ammunition and other supplies When the situation permits
troops which have been heavily engaged are rested and
reorganized before being assigned a new and important
mission
29
45- 50
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
STAFF
2 45 The staff assists the commander to the extent that
he may require by providing information data and advice ;
by preparing detailed plans and orders in accordance with
his directions ; and by exercising such supervision over the
execution of his orders as he may prescribe A staff officer
as such does not exercise command
46 The staff may be divided into two groups-the general
staff and the special staff In large units these two staff
groups are separate and distinct ; In smaller units they merge
into each other and one staff officer frequently is charged
with duties pertaining to both staff groups
â¢ 47 In every headquarters there is a constant tendency to
multiply personnel expand the functions of staff administration
and accumulate records and office equipment The
commander must avoid this expansion He must organize
his headquarters so as to maintain its readiness for prompt
movement
i 48 The organization functions and duties of the various
sections of the staff and the employment and duties of liaison
officers are prescribed in FM 0 -5
COMBAT ORDERS
â¢ 49 The authority to issue orders is an inherent function
of command Orders are normally issued to next subordinate
commanders Bypassing the normal channels of command
is resorted to only in urgent situations; in such cases
both the commander issuing and the commander receiving
the order should notify intermediate commanders of its
purport as soon as possible
â¢
50 Orders may be either complete or fragmentary
The order is complete when it covers all essential aspects
and phases of the operation Complete orders include missions
to all subordinate units charged with the execution of
tactical operations in carrying out the commander's plan
Fragmentary orders are used when speed in delivery and
execution is imperative Fragmentary orders are issued successively
as the situation develops and decisions are made
and consist of separate instructions to one or more subordinate
30
OPERATIONS
50- 54
units prescribing the' part each is to play in the operation or
in the separate phases thereof This procedure will be usual
in divisions and smaller units Fragmentary orders may be
either oral or written They are concise but not at the
expense of clarity and omission of essential information
Instructions issued in fragmentary orders may be repeated in
a complete field order or in an annex if considered desirable
9 5 Orders should be originated sufficiently early and
transmitted in such form as to permit subordinate commanders
the maximum periods to reconnoiter to estimate
their own situations to issue their orders and to prepare
their troops for the contemplated operation Commanders
should be alert to forestall delays in the successive dissemination
of orders in their lower echelons
â¢ 52 In many situations it may be necessary or desirable
to issue an order to warn of impending operations (warning
orders) A warning order contains information which enables
subordinate commanders to make preparations for a
contemplated operation Its principal purpose is to gain
time for preparatory measures and to conserve the energy
of the troops
â¢ 53 An order should not trespass upon the province of a
subordinate It should contain everything that the subordinate
must know to carry out his mission but nothing more
54 Orders must be clear and explicit and as brief as is
consistent with clarity ; short sentences are easily understood
Clarity is more important than technique The more urgent
the situation the greater the need for conciseness in the
order Any statement of reasons for measures adopted
should be limited to what is necessary to obtain intelligent
cooperation from subordinates Detailed instructions for a
variety of contingencies or prescriptions that are a matter
of training do not inspire confidence and have no place in an
order Trivial and meaningless expressions divide responsibility
and lead to the adoption of half measures by subordinates
Exaggerated and bombastic phrases invite ridicule
and weaken the force of an order Expressions such as
""attack vigorously "" if used in orders are not only verbose
and meaningless but tend to weaken the force of subsequent
orders in which such expressions do not appear
3
55- 58
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â 55 Orders should prescribe only so far as conditions can
be foreseen Orders which attempt to regulate matters too
far in the future result in frequent changes Frequent
changes in orders overload the means of signal communication
cause confusion and misunderstanding impose needless
hardships on the troops and injure their morale '
Orders issued by subordinates should not be mere repetition
of those from higher authority with additions of their
own New orders are clearer and more satisfactory
â¢ 56 As a rule it is desirable to keep contemplated operations
secret as long as possible and to confine knowledge
thereof to a few staff officers and senior commanders However
upon entry into' action no unit should be in doubt as
to what the commander wants it to do Whenever knowledge
of his intentions is necessary to insure the cooperation of the
units engaged a commander does not hesitate to disclose them
to all concerned Ignorance of his intentions may often
lead to inactivity on the part of subordinates
â¢ 57 It is impossible to prescribe detailed forms of orders
to fit every tactical situation To attempt to do so would
result in a rigid form and a routine style of expression which
would not be in accord with the tactical requirements presented
by the diverse situations that arise in war To the
extent practicable however it has been found efficient and
convenient to clA-csify combat orders according to their purpose
and scope and for some of these to adopt a standard
sequence of composition This makes for ease of understanding
the avoidance of omissions and ready reference
Moreover experience has shown that an order which can
be misunderstood will be misunderstood and that to obviate
this danger it is necessary to follow certain rules relating to
the designations of boundaries details of time and place
military terminology abbreviations designations of units and
the like For details relating to these matters see FM 0 -5

"OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONAL TASKS
The broad Operational Functional Task areas provide an excellent framework for
analyzing the operational lessons learned from Operation SHINGLE. While analysis of all the
tasks can provide lessons, focus will be given to Operational Maneuver, and Operational C2.
OP1 - Operational Movement and Maneuver
As discussed above, an amphibious assault is the ultimate form of a joint operational
maneuver. In this case, Allied forces were committed to executing a left hook behind the
German lines, but then failed to continue their maneuver inland to accomplish their objectives.
The British believed the landing force would cause a German reaction favoring the Allied attacks
near Cassino. The American operational leader of the landing force, Lucas, never a believer in
the plan, decided to consolidate his forces on the beachhead and prepare for a counterattack
rather than risking any advance. He had studied Salerno and Gallipoli and concluded that to push
ahead and over-stretch himself before he was strongly ashore would be fatal. The Operations
Order of the 5th Army reinforced his opinion, uncompromisingly asserting that the Advance was
not to take place unless it can be synchronized with the operations of the remainder of 5th Army
in close vicinity of the beach-head31
OP5 - Operational Command and Control (C2)
Never far from anyones thoughts was the near-disaster of Salerno.32 On the fifth day
of the Salerno invasion, the Germans almost succeeded in driving the Allies off of the beaches,
but the beachhead was held and the Germans began their fighting withdrawal up the Italian
13
peninsula. The Germans were concerned about the surrender of the Italians, and sought to
ensure the safe withdrawal of forces from the southern Italy to the Rome area. Despite the
victory, the Salerno landing left the Allies with a legacy that hung like a dark cloud over the
entire Italian campaign.33 Despite this setback, progress was generally good: Italy had
surrendered in September, and the Allies were maintaining constant pressure on German forces.
For SHINGLE, American General Lucas commanded the 6th Corps, which included one
British and one U.S. division, fighting in support of the 5th U.S. and 8th British Armies, all under
the 15th Army Group, commanded by British General Alexander. The combined staffs proved to
be too much.
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual 3500.04C includes in its definition of
Operational C2 the requirement to provide operational guidance, direction and vision to
assigned forces.34 Probably the single most significant reason for the operational failure of
SHINGLE was the lack of guidance and vision from the operational commanders, primarily due
to the friction that developed at higher levels between British and American officers. As
previously described, the British saw the operation as an elaborate bluff, requiring great risk.
The Americans saw it as an unwise use of resources and sought to minimize the risk. To solve
this discrepancy they frequently chose to simply not communicate. This C2 problem can be
illustrated by some examples:
Starting at the strategic level - the British saw the Mediterranean as a vital part of the war
against Germany. It would lead to the soft underbelly of Europe, as Churchill described it.
They were not against OVERLORD, but they believed that fighting a prolonged Mediterranean
action could sufficiently weaken the Germans so that the inevitable cross-channel invasion
would be assured success. The Americans, who were also taxed by a war in the Pacific against
14
the Japanese, looked for a decisive attack against the Germans to end the war more quickly.
They had been working since the third month after the attack at Pearl Harbor on an operation
designed to get troops across the Channel and into a major battle on the classic invasion routes
into Germany.35 The differences of the two nations were embodied in their principle military
advisors. General George C. Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff favored a direct thrust into
northwest Europe, while General Sir Alan Brooke, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, favored
the indirect, or peripheral, strategy. Marshall advised Roosevelt bluntly in May of 1943 that
The Mediterranean is a vacuum into which Americas great military might could be drawn off
until there was nothing left with which to deal the decisive blow against the Continent.36
Ten days before the assault, an important difference emerged between Alexanders and
Clarks visions regarding the Alban Hills. Alexander repeated to Clark that the objective of the
landing was to cut the enemys main communications in the Colli Laziali [another name for the
Alban Hills] area Southeast of Rome, and to threaten the [German] rear.37 As Clark interpreted
this directive, the 5th Army was (a) To seize and secure a beachhead in the vicinity of Anzio and
(b) Advance on Colli Laziali.38 Clark, who had commanded at Salerno, expected to see the
same pattern of German opposition and turned his emphasis to securing the beachhead, diggingin,
and holding a large reserve force to face the counter attacks. By Alexanders plan the Anzio
forces were to move inland and take the critical Alban Hills. Clark saw the 5th Army capturing
them as part of its drive north.
In the event that the German resistance was slight, the 6th Corps, the invasion force under
Lucas, was expected to advance on the Alban Hills, but it would be the personal decision of
the corps commander whether to attack or defend. Lucas admitted that he had no faith in the
plan; he wrote in his diary, in fact, there is no military reason for SHINGLE.39 He also must
15
have had in his mind the advice he received from Clark, just before the convoys were to sail
from Naples; Dont stick your neck out as I did at Salerno.40 It seems clear that he went ashore
determined not to advance to the hills and never communicated his intentions to his British
subordinates.
Major-General W.R.C. Penney, commander of the British 1st Infantry Division - one of
the two divisions to make the amphibious assault - had been pressing for weeks to get any details
about the invasion plan after the initial landing. He received the reply:
This directive does not include plans for an advance from the beachhead to
or towards the final objective. Such plans are extremely tentative: this advance is
not likely to take place unless it is synchronized with operations of the remainder
of the Fifth Army in close vicinity of the beachhead.41
By the middle of February, the Allied commanders were feeling the strain of sustained
combat operations. While both Lucas and Penney had written in their diaries before SHINGLE
that they had a mutual confidence, trust and liking of one another,42 there was now a sense of
mutual frustration and dissatisfaction. On the evening of 10 February, Penney wrote a letter
which was a formidable indictment of Lucas as a field commander.43 On 16 February, Major-
General Truscott and Major-General V. Evelegh were both appointed as Deputy Corps
Commanders to Lucas in an effort to smooth inter-Allied relations. Aside from the international
aspect of command, Lucas did not seem to give clear and decisive guidance, and his conferences
were likened by some to an inefficient companys meetings.44 On 23 February, Clark made
Lucas his deputy army commander and command of the 6th Corps went to Truscott. Johnny
Lucas was ill  tired physically and mentally from the long responsibility of command in
battle...Ihad for some time been considering a change45
Verney correctly grasped the problem that a combined C2 structure mixed with differing
commanders visions were to produce, It was unsatisfactory to have both nations involved;
16
either an all-British effort or an all-American operation would have solved many problems of
administration and command.46
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
I felt like a lamb being led to the slaughter
-Remark by Major General Lucas, Commander U.S. 6th Corps, regarding Anzio.47
Conclusions about the Anzio landing have changed somewhat as the years since its
execution pass. There are those, including Churchill, who view it as a strategic success in that
the German forces expended in Italy were unavailable in France. But that is not the point.
SHINGLE was planned as an operation, and as such it failed. The U.S. Army Center of Military
History makes this clear by writing, The operation clearly failed in its immediate objectives of
outflanking the Gustav Line, restoring mobility to the Italian campaign, and speeding the capture
of Rome.48 If it was indeed an operational failure, then there must be blame, but where to assign
it?
Once the blame would have been placed squarely at the feet of Lucas, as Alexander
himself did when he stated Lucas, missed his opportunity by being too slow and cautious. He
failed to realize the great advantages that surprise had given him. He allowed Time to beat
him.49 Even mild defenders of Lucas acknowledge it cannot be denied that for Lucas to lose
contact with the Germans for two and a half days was wholly wrong.50 Churchill blames Clark
and Lucas:
In all his talk with meAlexander envisaged that the essence of the battle
was the seizure of the Alban Hills with the utmost speed, and to this end I was
able to obtain from the United States their 504th Parachute Regimentbut at the
last moment General Clark cancelled [it]and the American General
Lucasseems to have had the idea in his mind that at all costs he must be
prepared for a counterattackthe whole operation became stagnant.51
17
Some now seek to distribute blame to Alexander and Churchill. Blumenson writes, Alexander
failed also. The concept was daring, but he was too much the gentleman to make it work;52 and
Churchills Gallipoli of World War II, Anzio was not so catastrophic a failure, but was a
blunder nonetheless.53 While Churchill may have been the unstoppable force to resurrect
SHINGLE after it had been dropped in December of 1943, he shouldnt be held to blame for its
failure. It would be an extraordinary commander, in my opinion, who could directly influence
the outcome of a major battle once it has begun. To blame one seems like a far too easy solution.
Kesselring himself seems to have hit the mark most accurately, noting that the operation
was only half-attempted. It was doomed from the beginning as it was given insufficient
resources and placed in an untenable timeline  the unfortunate product of a Space-Time-Force
interaction.
Operation SHINGLE can offer todays military planner several valuable lessons and
bears examination. Immediate lessons from the campaign were applied during Operation
OVERLORD five months after the landings at Anzio. The Allies had learned to send more
strength ashore in the initial landing and to drive inland immediately to certain key points. They
learned that a small force, once established on a beachhead, could survive in the face of severe
difficulty if properly supplied by logistic lifelines from the sea. Issues of poor communication
and C2 relating to combined forces were largely resolved. These are all important lessons for the
modern U.S. planner to note as virtually every operation in which U.S. forces will be involved in
the foreseeable future will involve coalition or alliance partners and take place within evertightening
fiscal constraints. As the Allies were forced to discover at Anzio, not sticking ones
chin out too far may save an initial blow - but it can lead to catastrophic consequences if caution
turns invasion to attrition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

objective sometimes may be attained by maneuveralone ; ordinarily it must be gained by battle A sound tacticalmaneuver has a great influence on the successful outcomeof battle8 45 The purpose of offensive action is the destruction ofthe hostile armed forces To facilitate the accomplishment ofthis purpose the commander selects a physical objective suchas a body of troops dominating terrain a center of lines ofcommunication or other vital area in the hostile rear forhis attack The attainment of this objective is the basis ofhis own and all subordinate plansThis objective shouldhave the following characteristics :a Its capture must be possible within the time and spacelimits imposed by the assigned missionb Its capture should assure the destruction of the enemyin his position or the threat of its capture should compel theenemy to evacuate his positionc It should produce a convergence of effortd It must be easily identifiede Its capture should facilitate contemplated future operationsPI 452 The objective having been selected all components aredirected in coordinated effort towards its attainment Actionswhich do not contribute to this purpose are avoided9 453 Sound tactical maneuver in the offensive is characterized by a concentration of effort in a direction where successwill insure the attainment of the objective On the remainderof the front are used only the minimum means necessary todeceive the enemy and to hinder his maneuver to opposethe main attack9697			454-460FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONSOPERATIONS460-463DISTRIBUTION OF FORCES 454 In the offensive troops are distributed into two ormore principal tactical groupings : one or more main or decisive attacks in which the greatest possible offensive power isconcentrated to bring about a decision and one or moresecondary or holding attacks whose mission is to rendermaximum assistance to the main attackMain attack groupings are designed to secure the objectiveand to destroy the hostile force Secondary attack groupingsare designed to hold the enemy in position to force him tocommit his reserves prematurely and to an indecisive location and to prevent him from reinforcing the front of themain attack 455 In each tactical grouping the mass of the availableon which the main attack and the main efforts of subordinateunits are made often is determined by the possibilities whichthe terrain offers for effective employment of artillery andmechanized unitsSelection of the direction of the main attack also is influenced by the time available for movement before the attackmust be launchedIn many situations the most rapid anddecisive results are to be expected when the main attack iscomposed principally of large armored units or when suchunits lead the main attack Air superiority and effective support of the armored units by combat aviation are essentialto the sustained drive of the armored unitsFORMS OF OFFENSIVE ACTIONmeans of combat is concentrated in a main effort and is applied in a decisive direction 46 Attack maneuvers are classified as envelopments andpenetrations 456 Main attacks are characterized by narrow zones of 462 In an envelopment the main attack is directed againstaction by strong support of artillery tanks and other supporting weapons by effective support of combat aviation andby deep echelonment of reservesthe flank or rear of the initial disposition of the enemy'smain forces and toward an objective in rear of his frontlines It seeks to surround that portion of the enemy's forcesin front of the objective It is assisted usually by a secondaryattack directed against the enemy's frontA successful envelopment depends largely on the ucgreeof surprise attained and on the ability of the secondary attackto contain the bulk of the enemy's forces Surprise is securedby maneuvering to avoid observation by the enemy and bydeceiving himSuperior mobility increases the prospect ofsuccessAn envelopment avoids attacking on ground chosen by theenemy and forces him to fight in two or more directions tomeet the converging efforts of the attack An envelopmentwhich strikes the defender's flank or rear so as to avoid anypart of his organized front and small-arms fire from thatfront is preferableIt minimizes losses handicaps the defender's ability to meet it promptly compels the defender tomeet an attack on ground chosen by the attacker and whensuccessful is more decisive 457 Secondary attacks are characterized by lack of depthreduction of reserves to the minimum maximum fire power inthe attacking echelon and by wide zones of action for theattack units They will therefore usually be assigned limitedobjectives initially 458 When it is impracticable to determine initially whenor where the main attack is to be made the commander retains his freedom to act by disposing his forces in greatdepth by holding out strong reserves and by maintainingclose control of his supporting weapons 459 Attacking echelons once committed to action lose theirimmediate availability for employment in the execution ofother missionsDeployed and under fire they can changefront only at the risk of incurring heavy losses The commander can materially influence the course of an action oncebegun through the employment of reserves fire support andcombat aviation0 460 In selecting the direction for the main attack theterrain must be carefully studiedThe choice of the front 463 A turning movement is an enveloping maneuver whichpasses around the enemy's main forces striking at some vitalpoint deep in the hostile rear The force making the maneuver usually operates so far from the secondary attack that the9899		463-465FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONSOPERATIONSprincipal tactical groupings are beyond mutual supportingdistance (the distance by which forces may be separated andyet permit one to move to the aid of another before it can bedefeated by an enemy force) ; hence each grouping must bestrong enough or mobile enough to avoid defeat in detailWhen conditions favor such action all combat elements ofthe command may be employed in the turning force leaving only reconnaissance elements confronting the hostile dispositions The turning movement is adapted particularly tohighly mobile commands such as cavalry armored and motorized forces and forces transported by aircraft It is invariably employed by highly mobile forces in situations inwhich the vital objective in the hostile rear can be seized bysuch a maneuver before it is necessary to involve the enveloping force in a major engagement with the enemy Deceptionsecrecy and mobility are vital to successful execution of aturning movement 464 When the enemy takes up a defensive position thecommander of the attacking forces should consider the possibility of turning the enemy out of his position and forcinghim to withdraw and fight on ground more favorable to theattackerSituations may occur especially in the pursuit of a defeated force in which the enemy can be forced by directattack to take up a defensive position while a portion of themore mobile attacking forces executes a turning movementagainst his lines of communication 465 A double envelopment is executed by three principaltactical groups two enveloping attack forces and a secondary attack force A simultaneous envelopment of both flanksgenerally requires considerable superiorityThe command seeking to attack by double developmentmust be deployed or capable of deploying on a broad frontagainst an enemy on a much narrower front or with littlecapability or room for maneuver The maneuver is executedby fighting a holding battle with the center while envelopingforces strike on both hostile flanks When mobile' forces areavailable in reserve they may complete the envelopment byan attack from the rearWhen conditions favor it thismaneuvershouldbeused because of the decisiveform ofpromisesresults it466-469 466 An envelopment of one flank is executed by two principal tactical groups the main or enveloping attack forceand the secondary attack force After an initial envelopment of one flank favorable conditions for passing to adouble envelopment through the use of reserves may be created when the success of our troops has placed the enemy ina disadvantageous situation 467 The enemy's preparations to meet an envelopment ofhis flank ordinarily cannot be organized as completely asthe defense of his front especially if the envelopment islaunched from a locality deep on the hostile flank or rearThe defender strengthens an unsupported flank by reserves echeloned in depth and in width When threatenedwith envelopment he moves them to meet the maneuver Hemay attempt to envelop the attacking forces or to extendhis flank beyond that of the attack up to the limit of hisstrength An attempt on the part of the attacker to meetsuch hostile extension may lead to overextension or to a dangerous separation of the enveloping forces from those making the secondary attack It usually is better to take advantage of the enemy's extension and consequent weaknessby retaining a deep formation and to penetrate his thinlyheld front than to overextend in an effort further to outflank the position When the enemy extends his positionbeyond the enveloping forces particular attention must bepaid to protecting the exterior flank by the use of the general reserves of the higher commanderII 468 In a penetration the main attack passes through someportion of the area occupied by the enemy's main forces andis directed on an objective in his rear It is characterizedby the complete rupture of the enemy's dispositions ; theseizure of the objective by operations through the gap ; andthe envelopment of one or both flanks created by the breakthroughThe essential conditions for success are surprise sufficientfire power especially combat aviation and artillery to neutralize the front of penetration favorable terrain within thehostile position for the advance of the attacking troops andstrength to carry the attack through to its objective0 469 When the situation does not favor an envelopmentthe main attack is directed to penetrate the hostile front000		469-47FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONSOPERATIONSConditions which demand a penetration are enemy's flanksunassailable ; lack of time to make an enveloping maneuverConditions which favor a penetration are overextension ofthe enemy ; terrain and observation favorable for more effective cooperation of the combined arms Such an attack oftencan be organized more quickly than can an envelopment! 470In the penetration of a defensive position the mainattack is launched on a front wider than that of the contemplated break-through in order to hold the enemy in placeon the flanks of the penetration The attack on the remainder of the hostile front is designed to contain the enemyand prevent him from moving his reservesThe amount of artillery mechanized units and supportingcombat aviation available largely determines the width ofthe front of penetration The wider the front of penetrationthe deeper can it be driven and the more difficult will it befor the enemy to close the gap The deeper the penetrationthe more effective will be the action of mobile reserves inseizing the objective and rolling up the hostile flanksThe greatest distribution in depth is placed opposite theprospective front of penetrationThe distribution of troopsprovides for three separate impulses ; a break through thehostile position a widening of the gap thus created by enveloping one or both interior hostile flanks and the seizure of theobjective and exploitation of the successThe sequence of these impulses depends on the situationIn some situations it is practicable through the existence ofweaknesses or gaps in the enemy's front for mobile troops(armored motorized or cavalry divisions) to break throughand to proceed straight to the objective while operations oflocal envelopment and exploitation are performed by lessmobile troops In other situations foot troops must breakthrough the more mobile troops being held initially in reserve and used later to operate through the gap created bythe foot troopsi 47 The mission of the attacking echelon of troops is tobreak through the enemy's dispositions so that he will beunable to reconstitute his front on a rearward line Untilthis mission has been accomplished the attacking troops donot divert their strength to the attack of the flanks of thegap Hostile counterattacks against the flanks of the pene0247-474tration are met by reserves by the fire of the artillery andby combat aviationThe missions of rolling up the flanks of a gap createdbypenetration and of exploiting the break-through are assignedto reserves Cavalry armored and motorized units are especially suitable for seizing the objective and for exploitationThese units are supported by combat aviation operatingagainst hostile reserves and artillery and other importantobjectives Troops transported by air may be used to support these operations 472 In large commands a penetration often is initiatedbylaunching simultaneously two or more powerful attacks (amultiple penetration) against weak localities on the hostilefront Strong localities are contained initially by secondaryattacks When the penetrating attacks have advanced farenough to permit the interior strong localities are reducedby maneuver and the penetrating attacks are united into asingle main attack The pinching out of strong hostile localities often is facilitated by launching multiple penetrations inconverging directions The doctrines applicable to a singlepenetration govern the organization and conduct of a multiple penetration 473 Whether the maneuver adopted is an envelopment ora penetration success will depend primarily on intelligentenergetic and coordinated executionThis execution mustbe based on a sound plan which is influenced largely by theobjective and direction of the main attackThe doctrines which underlie the employment of the combined arms in the offensive are conservation of the combatpower of troops in the attack echelon provision of assistancefor them to close with the enemy and thereafter support oftheir attack until the enemy's power of resistance is brokenFRONTAGES AND DEPTHS 474 The frontage assigned to any unit in an attackvarieswith the mobility type of armament mission andcombatpower of the unit the terrain the amount of fire supportavailable and the probable hostile resistance As a generalguide an infantry battalion at full strength in a main attackseldom is assigned a frontage less than 500 yards or morethan 000 yards measured on the front of the hostileposition03		475-480FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONSOPERATIONS0 475 Units are distributed in depth to provide flexibility ofmaneuver continuity in the attack and security For infantry units depth of formation for combat rather than a wideextension of front is necessary in the initial deploymentThe progress of battle will call for maneuvers that cannot beclearly foreseen This condition can be met only by initialdistribution in depthLaterally the distribution of troops in attack is governedprincipally by the doctrine of the main attack and main effortIt is influenced also by the relative advantages offered bydifferent sections of the terrain When the situation requiresan unusually wide extension of the command the increaseis effected by widening the gaps between unitsRESERVES 476 The initial strength and location of the reserve willvary with its contemplated missions the type of maneuverpossible hostile reaction and clarity of the situation Afterthe attack is launched the reserve and the fires of supportingarms are the principal means available to the commander forshaping the course of action and for enforcing favorabledecisionThe primary mission of the reserve is to enter the

favor the maneuver When thesituation is obscure the reserve may consist initially of thebulk of the command centrally located and prepared tomove to any point on the front or flanks 48The location of the reserve should combine a maximumof protection for itself against hostile observation and airand mechanized attack with a road net which facilitates rapidmovement to any point of possible employmentMotor vehicles should be held available for the movement of reserveslacking organic means of rapid movement 482 Choosing the proper time at which the reserve shouldbe used is often the commander's most difficult and mostimportant decisionNevertheless at the decisive moment of action every manthat can be used to advantage must participate in the battleand the reserve must be launched

MEDIUM TANK, M4, WITH WELDED HULL AND SAND SHIELDS. 75 MM AND CAL. .30 GUNS ARE IN COMBINATION GUN MOUNT, M34A1
These medium tanks, nicknamed ""General
Shermans"" by British troops, have
played an important part in Allied victories
in Africa, Sicily and Russia ever
since they first helped rout Marshal Rommel's
troops at El Alamein .
Standardized' in October, 1941, they
introduced a number of improvements
over the Medium Tank, M3, Series, which
they replaced in production .
The 75 mm gun was relocated in the
turret, providing 360Â° traverse and
greater elevation and depression than was
possible in Medium Tank, .M13 The silhouette
was lowered by the elimination
of the cupola, thus making the tank a less
conspicuous target and also resulting in a
lowered center of gravity, making the
tank more stable . The 37 mm gun was
eliminated. The crew was decreased to
five, including an assistant driver .
The 75 mm gun breech was turned 90 Â°
from the vertical, allowing for easy righthand
loading. The radio was relocated in

a turret ""bulge."" Greater comfort and
safety were provided for all crew members .
Produced simultaneously by different
manufacturers, the various models differ
from each other principally in their
engines . A further difference is that the
M4A1 has a cast hull, whereas the others
have welded hulls . In addition, the M4A5,
produced in Canada, embodies differences
requested by the Canadian government .
All have cast turrets .
Principal armament (except for the
M4A5) is a 75 mm Gun, M3, mounted
with a cal . .30 machine gun in a combination.
gun mount in the turret . The turret
guns may be elevated from -10Â° to
+25Â° . They are fired electrically by means
of foot and hand switches. A gyrostabilizer
is provided .
An A.P.C . projectile, fired from the 75
mm gun, has a muzzle velocity of 2,030
feet per second, and will penetrate 3 .1
inches of face-hardened armor plate at
1,000 yards .
Other armament includes a cal . .30
machine gun in the bow, operated by the
assistant driver ; a cal . .50 machine gun,
mounted at the top of the turret, operated
by the commander for antiaircraft use,
and a 2-inch smoke mortar . A clip is

mounted in the turret to carry a cat .45
submachine gun, which can he used
through the pistol port in the side of the
turret .
The turret is a one-piece casting of
armor which rotates on a ball bearing race
recessed and protected against direct hits
and lead splash from enemy fire . The
turret basket is rigidly fastened to the
turret by means of a ring of bolts around
its circumference . The turret hatch ring
acts as antiaircraft gun mount .
The driver sits at the left bow of the
tank. The assistant driver sits at the
right bow . The loader sits in the turret,
to the left of the 75 mm gun, and the
gunner to its right . The tank commander
sits in the rear of the turret, behind the
gunner. Adjustable seats, allowing 12
inches of movement up and down and 5
inches fore and aft, are provided for the
gunner, driver and assistant driver.
Access to the tank is through two
hatches in the bow and a revolving hatch
in the turret . An emergency escape hatch
is located in the tank floor, behind the
assistant driver.
Indirect vision is provided for each
member of the crew by means of periscopes.
The gunner's periscope is synchronized
with the gun, contains a telescopic
sight, and changes its line of sight
only if the gun is elevated or depressed or
the turret rotated . All other periscopes are
mounted so that they can be tilted up or
down and rotated through 360 Â°. Early
models had direct vision slots, protected
by thick glass plates and hinged covers,
for the driver and assistant driver . Because
of their vulnerability to bullet
splash, these were eliminated in later
production, and additional periscopes
were provided .
The transmission has five forward
speeds and one reverse speed . A parking
brake is built into the' transmission . The

controlled differential transmits engine
power to the final drive unit, and contains
a brake system for steering and stopping
the vehicle . The final drive units transmit
power from the controlled differential to
the hub of the driving sprockets through
a set of reduction gears . The entire power
train can be removed from the vehicle
when necessary.
Six 2-wheeled, rubber-tired bogies or
suspensions, bolted to the hull, support
the vehicle on volute springs . The tracks
are driven by sprockets on the front of
the vehicle . Two idlers are mounted on
eccentric shafts at the rear end of the
hull, and provide for adjustment of the
track tension. The weight of the upper
portion of the track is carried by tracksupporting
rollers. (Some vehicles have
the track-support roller directly over the
suspension bracket. A second type has the
roller offset to the rear of the bracket and
is fitted with a track skid on top of the
bracket.)
Two fixed 10-lb . fire extinguishers are
provided in the engine compartment, and
may be operated from the driver's scat or
from outside the tank . Portable 4-lb . fire
extinguishers are provided in the driver's
compartment and in the turret.
The tank is equipped with a two-way
radio and an interphone system . An
auxiliary generator provides additional
current at times of unusual drain, and
may also be used in preheating the engine
compartment in cold weather.
The pilot tank, designated Medium
Tank, T6, was built at Aberdeen Proving
Ground, and had a cast hull . The vehicle
had an entrance hatch at the side and had
two additional machine guns in the bow,
which were eliminated from the production
tanks .
A number of changes were made during
production, with the result that newer
vehicles differ somewhat from those
produced earlier.
The original Combination Gun Mount,
M34, had a front shield which protected
the 75 mm gun only . Ordnance Committee
action in October, 1942, standardized
Combination Gun Mount, M34A1, a
modification which incorporated a direct
sighting telescope. This mount may be
recognized by its front shield which protects
the Cal . .30 machine gun and the
direct sighting telescope, as well as the
75 mm gun. It has two ""ears"" projecting
a few inches over the 75 mm gun .
The lower front plate of the hull on
early models consisted of three pieces,
bolted together . Later production vehicles
used a one-piece plate .
Introduction of sand shields over the
suspensions, and of water-protected ammunition
chests, were among other changes
on later vehicles .

MEDIUM TANKS M4 (105 MM HOW.), M4A3 (105 MM HOW.) STANDARD
These nIodifica .tions of \Tedium 'I""ank~,
1\14 and 1\14A3, were designed to combine
the firepower of a 105 n1m lniwiticr
with the performance characteristics of a

to the medium tanks with 75 111111
guns authorized by Tables of Basic
Allowances, and to replace the 75 lum
Howitzer Motor Carriages, M8, in Battalion
Headquarters Companies, Medium
Tank Battalions .
The 105 mm Howitzer, M4, is mounted
in a Combination Gun Mount, M52, with
one cal. .30 Machine Gun, M1919A4,
flexible, in a 360Â° hand-traversed turret .
No gyrostabilizer is provided . The howitzer
is a redesign of 105 mm Howitzer,
M2A1.
Other armament is the same as for
Medium Tanks, M4, and M4A3.
The cast turret has a partial turret
basket. A fighting seat for the gunner, a
convoy seat for the tank commander and
a riding seat for the loader are provided .
All seats traverse with the turret.
A commander's vision cupola is provided
above the turret . Equipped with
six prismatic vision blocks, of 3 inch,
laminated, bullet-resisting glass, it affords
a wide field of view .
There is a suitable floor over the
stowage space on either side of the power
tunnel. Pistol ports and lifting hooks are
the same as for Medium Tanks, M4, and
padding and safety belts are furnished
wherever required. A pintle for towing
an ammunition trailer is provided .
Construction of two pilot Medium
Tanks, M4A4, mounting the 105 mm
howitzer, was authorized by Ordnance
Committee action in December, 1942.
Designated Medium Tank, M4A4E1, the
vehicle was tested at Aberdeen Proving
Ground and at Fort Knox, Ky . Modifications
deemed necessary were incorporated
in new pilot models designated Medium
Tank, M4E5. Standardization of the
vehicles was approved in August, 1943 .

MEDIUM AND HEAVY TANK ENGINES (Continued)
The variety of medium tank engines
shown here is a tribute to the resourcefulness
of American industry, in cooperation
with the Ordnanct_ Department, in
meeting an emergency.
When the program for the quantity
production of medium tanks was inaugurated
in 1940, it became necessary to find
sources of sufficient engines. Medium Tank
M3 used the Continental (Wright)R-975
engine, an aircraft, type of engine adapted
for use in tank ~i; . tlium Tank M3 (Diesel)
used the Guiberson T-1400 Diesel engine,
but only a few of these were built .
To avoid conflicting with the Air Forces,
whose need "" for engines was equally imperative,
efforts were made to adapt commercial
truck and passenger car engines,
already in production, for use in tanks .
First such engine authorized for use as
an alternate power plant was the G.M.

and bus and truck type engines . In the
medium tank installation, the engines,
located one on either side of the engine
compartment, are connected through a
step-up gear and double clutch housing
to a common propeller shaft . Originally
authorized for use in Medium Tank 1M13A3
by Ordnance Committee action in December
1941, these engines are now used in
Medium Tank M4A2 and in vehicles
based on these tanks .
The Chrysler A-57 power unit consists
of five conventional passenger car engines,
geared together to operate as a
single unit . Originally authorized for use
in Medium Tank M3A4, it was used subsequently
in Medium Tank M4A4.
The Ford GAA engine is an 8-cylinder,
V-type engine designed specifically for
tanks. It was introduced in Medium Tank
M4A3 by Ordnance Committee action in
January 1942. A modification known as

"rthodox method of attack. Simonds hinted
in the appreciation that the attack would be made at night, supported by
heavy bombers. The outline plan that he submitted with it called for the
tanks to lead rather than support the infantry. To get the infantry
through the front line, tracked, armoured personnel carriers would be
used in combat for the first time. Simonds had seventy-six superfluous
self-propelled 105-mm Priests stripped of their guns and converted to
carry infantry. The Kangaroos were then issued to the assault brigades
in the days preceding the operation.28 In this fashion, the infantry would
be able to move through the forward defensive line in relative safety,
then dismount before taking the initial objectives.
Simondss notion of using air support to neutralize the enemys
counter-armour forces was feasible, as Operation Cobra had shown, but
only if German tanks and antitank guns were concentrated within the
target areas. Apart from some shaking of the enemys morale, bombs that
fell in open fields accomplished little. The bomber targets specified in
the outline plan would be the strong-points preventing the infantry from
cracking the forward defensive line and through which Simonds
expected the counterattacks to be delivered: west of the road, the towns
of May and Fontenay, which had been denied him since mid-July; and
east of the road, a forest south of La Hogue which he suspected to be a
tank harbour.29 The Lancasters of Bomber Command were to obliterate
these areas beginning at H-hour (the time the attack would commence),
tentatively set for 2300 hours on 8 August. Between the two
target areas lay, straddling the road, a narrow zone through which 2nd
Corpss armoured columns would advance.30 Three years after the fact,
Simonds gave a lecture during which he explained that he had wanted
[air support] in Phase I, to seal off the flanks of the very narrow corridor
through which the armoured columns were to pass and, in particular,
from enemy armour.31 It therefore seems that Simonds was less concerned
with actually destroying the enemy in the target areas than with
preventing him from interfering with the advance.
When the appreciation was written, 1st SS and 9th SS held the line
in front of 2nd Corps with the bulk of their tanks and self-propelled guns.
Getting past the SS divisions in Phase I was expected to be the most difficult
part of the operation. Bombing would, in theory, prevent them

from counterattacking into the flanks of Simondss armoured columns
and possibly disorganizing the entire operation. Once the initial objectives
were secure, a firm base would be available through which the
armoured divisions could continue the assault.
As the advance would move out of the effective range of artillery
near the second German defensive line, Simonds now had to solve a puzzle
that had been pondered since the Great War: how to maintain the
momentum of the attack. His appreciation stated that
If all available air support is used for the first break in there will
be nothing for the second except diminished gun support, unless
a long pause is made with resultant loss of speed. If on the other
hand the first break in is based upon limited air support (heavy
night bombers) all available gun support and novelty of method,
the heavy day bombers and medium bombers will be available for
the second break in, at a time that gun support begins to
decrease and it should be possible to maintain a high tempo to the
operations.32
The outline plan, in the second phase, called for [a]ll available
medium bombers to lay [a] fragmentation carpet along the Falaise
road near the second line and [h]eavy day bombers (Fortresses) to
drop high explosive on Bretteville, Gouvix, Hautmesnil, and Cauvicourt.
Another attack with fragmentation bombs was proposed over a wider
area stretching further south, to neutralize German gun positions.33 This
concept applied the lessons of Goodwood, which had died out partly due
to a lack of fire support in the latter stage of the operation. Bombing in
Totalize would accompany the ground assaults and was arranged in progressive
waves timed to move with the troops, almost like a creeping barrage
of the Great War.
On 2 August Crerar sent a planning schedule to Brigadier C. C.
Mann, First Canadian Armys Chief of Staff, ordering conferences to
decide the technical matters related to the bombing attacks. Air force
doctrine by this point in the campaign called for the RAFs Second Tactical
Air Force (TAF) to work with 21st Army Group, constituting
together a combined force operating under separate commanders but in
furtherance of one combined plan. This relationship was extended to
subordinate formations, so Second Armys air support was provided by
83 Group RAF while 84 Group RAF was assigned to work with First
Canadian Army. The final decision to commit air forces or put air plans
into effect rested with the RAF, so requests by the army for support
therefore went to its associated group, and those that were beyond the
latters resources, such as heavy bomber strikes, were submitted through

parallel channels: First Canadian Army to 21st Army Group, and 84
Group to Second TAF. Requests were then passed up from Army GroupTAF
level to Allied Expeditionary Air Forces (AEAF) headquarters and
its commander, Air Chief Marshal Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory, who finally
coordinated with Bomber Command or the Eighth Air Force.34 The chain
of command denied the armies a direct communications link to the
strategic bombers providing support on any given occasion.35 The potential
negative consequences of this cumbersome arrangement had been
revealed in Operation Cobra: if the tactical situation changed after the
planes left the ground, or if there were any bombing errors, a flexible
response while the planes were in the air would not be possible.
Because 84 Groups headquarters did not become operational until
after the completion of Totalize, 83 Group was then coordinating air support
for both Crerar and Dempsey.36 Accordingly, Mann sent a tentative
air plan over to 83 Group in preparation for an important conference on
the air plan for Totalize. The meeting, held at First Canadian Army headquarters
on 4 August, was attended by Crerar, his staff officers, and
Simonds; C. A. Richardson, the Brigadier General Staff (Plans), 21st
Army Group; Leigh-Mallory; Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham, commander
of Second TAF; and the commanders of 83 and 84 Groups.37
Absent were any representatives from Bomber Command or Eighth Air
Force, which would not become involved until after plans were considered
at the TAF level. Procedural matters for the bombing were
explained to the army officers, and Leigh-Mallory explained that for
technical reasons, better accuracy can be obtained by using the heavy
bombers of Bomber Command on the targets to be hit with high explosive.
Simondss outline plan had called for Fortresses, but this specification
may simply have been due to a habit of thought because Eighth
Air Force was considered the day-bombing specialist. The decisions
taken at the conference concerning the timing of the attacks would force
Simonds to adhere to a strict timetable. If it became necessary to alter
the time of the air strikes, the army was told that the RAF require 5
hours prior to H hour, which Simonds had set for 2300, if a 24 hours
postponement is required on D-Daythen set for 8 August, but later
advanced twenty-four hours. Five hours notice was also required for a
postponement of the bombing in Phase II, slated for 1400 on D plus 1.
NO change was possible, therefore, after 0900 hours. This require34.

ment meant that despite any changes in the tactical situation on the
ground after 0900, the second-phase bombing could not be aborted.
Simonds would have to decide by that time whether or not to proceed
with the air strike.
First Canadian Armys formal Request for Air Support listed the
purpose of the first-phase bombing as the destruction of the main
enemy defensive localities and tank harbours on flanks of the attack.
Targets 1 to 5 would be attacked with high explosive, which was effective
against tanks and would also crater the ground, making it impassable to
either tracked or wheeled vehicles. The ground advance would begin
simultaneously with the air strikes, which were timed to last until H plus
forty-five minutes. Bombing in the second phase was to be more complicated.
Cratering was accepted for targets 6, 7, and 9, the main centres
of resistance in the enemys defensive system on the flanks of the
attack. H-hour was requested as 1400 on D plus 1, depending on the
weather, with the bombing to be completed by H plus thirty minutes.
Target 8, straddling the axis of advance, would have to be attacked by
means of a fragmentation carpet. The change in bomb type was due to
two factors. Cratering was unacceptable because it would impede the
advance, and as most of the German armour was expected to be in the
forward positions, high explosive would not be required. Secondly, the
purpose of the attack was the neutralization of enemy weapons and
infantry expected to garrison the second defensive position. Fragmentation
bombs would not knock out tanks, but they could be quite effective
against infantry and artillery given the right circumstances, as Cobra had
demonstrated. Fragmentation attacks were also requested against the
enemys main gun areas further south of the BrettevilleSt. Sylvain
linetargets 10, 11, and 12at the time that the break through is gaining
momentum.38
A target intelligence report outlined the probable enemy dispositions
within the target areas listed in the Request for Air Support. Target 6,
Bretteville-sur-Laize, was believed to be the headquarters for the western
part of the defensive line, and two roads ran through the town to the
Fôret de Cinglais, the main tank harbour in the area. Targets 7 (St. Sylvain),
8 (a cluster of areas astride the road), and 9 (Gouvix) contained
infantry, machine guns, tanks, SPs, mortars, artillery, and antitank guns
in various combinations and concentrations. The larger area of targets
10 through 12 showed few signs of occupation, but included prepared
inf[antry] def[ence]s and some bays suitable for reception of SP
art[iller]y or t[an]ks.39 There was even more to the target areas than
Canadian Intelligence knew. Bretteville-sur-Laize was another gun area,

the quarry south of Hautmesnil (target 8) contained Nebelwerfers, and
guns of Pickerts 3rd Flak Corps were located just to the north. Moreover,
suspicions that a major gun position was contained in the area to the
south, encompassing Bretteville-le-Rabet and Grainville-Langannerie,
were justified.40 If these defences could be neutralized by bombing, there
would be very little standing between 2nd Corps and Falaise.
While preparations for Totalize proceeded, the Germans were busy
making changes to their order of battle in the Caen area that would eventually
cause significant modifications to Simondss plan. By 2 August, 9th
SS Panzer Division had withdrawn from the line and moved west. 2nd
Corps Intelligence noted that its departure meant only 1st SS and 12th
SS were left to hold the hinge of Caen, but another formation was
expected to move into the line, possibly from Bretteville-sur-Laize. The
next day [a] large column was . . . reported moving West on our Left
flank, thereby confirming these suspicions.41 The Hitlerjugend also
withdrew from the line on the night of 3/4 August, moving back into
reserve north of Falaise. It was relieved by 272nd Infantry Division,
which had assumed a position on the eastern flank of 1st SS.42
By the early morning of 5 August, when it issued its summary for the
4th, First Canadian Army Intelligence was uncertain about the whereabouts
of 12th SS but expected it to form a reserve somewhere in the
area.43 It then learned through Ultradecrypted German signals provided
by British intelligencethat 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte
Adolf Hitler was being relieved that day, although there was some uncertainty
concerning the time at which this would occur and the strength of
the elements still in the line.44 Mann called Brigadier N. E. Rodger, 2nd
Corpss Chief of Staff, at 1330 hours to tell him that the Leibstandarte
seemed to be pulling away on our front.45 There was no information on
where it was withdrawing to, however. At 1415 hours Crerar called

phases, the latter should take priority. Simonds also told Crerar that the
timing of the air strikes in the second phase should not be changed. Crerar
recorded in his telephone log that Simonds want[ed] all interval.46
Mann had left that afternoon for AEAF headquarters in England,
where a major conference was scheduled for 1800 hours to settle the
details of 2nd Corpss air support. While in England he received a signal
from Crerar relating the main points of his discussion with Simonds
about the changing enemy dispositions which concluded, earlier time
for H h[ou]r phase two NOT repeat NOT acceptable. May require later
time on notice discussed.47 It is likely that Simonds wanted to delay the
start of Phase II until his artillery could move up, following his tactical
doctrine. Major-General George Kitching, commanding 4th Canadian
Armoured Division, later said that 1400 was chosen as H-hour because
it was assumed that it would take several hours of daylight to organize
the full scale assault by two divisions on the German defences in that
area.48 Another possibility, although less likely, was that Simonds,
expecting to launch that phase from a base just north of the second line
and knowing that the Germans would react with violent counterattacks,
hoped to catch them in the open where they would be destroyed by the
bombing. Previous air attacks on strong-points like Tilly had accomplished
little besides adding rubble to the defenders fortifications
because the infantry always dug in. The fragmentation bombs Simonds
wanted dropped on the areas of target eight would have an altogether different
effect if they caught soldiers moving over open ground.
The conference at AEAF was attended by senior officers from the
strategic air forces, 21st Army Group, and SHAEF. Mann outlined the
plan for Totalize, which had been issued that day to the divisions concerned.49
He explained the intention to break through two successive
German defensive positions and exploit toward Falaise, beginning with a
night attack astride the Caen-Falaise road supported by heavy bombing
on the flanks. West of the road, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division was to
break through the forward linemounted in the converted Priestsled
by the tanks of 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. East of the road, 51st
Highland Division and 33rd British Armoured Brigade were assigned similar
tasks. The armoured columns would advance to the infantrys objectives
where a base would be secured for the continuation of the attack in
Phase II by 4th Canadian Armoured Division. As per the instructions

Mann had recently received in the signal from Crerar, he told the airmen
that this phase would not begin before 1400 hours, and would also be
accompanied by preparatory bombing if possible.50
Manns pitch to the airmen for the proposed air support is detailed
in the conference minutes. He said that the area was heavily defended,
and they had been trying for nearly two months unsuccessfully, to break
through. Their own artillery could cover part of the area, but they had
only 400 guns against 400/500 enemy guns.51 Perhaps Mann felt compelled
to overstate his case considering that he proceeded to request the
bombing of the southernmost targets, 10 through 12, which intelligence
reported as mostly unoccupied. Bombing empty space was not likely to
be smiled upon by that particular audience, especially considering the
ongoing complaints from the air forces about the armys persistent failure
to cash in on the opportunities the former had provided since the
invasion began.52
Nevertheless, First Canadian Army had earlier predicted that the
likely German reaction to a breakthrough would be to move remaining
guns and tanks into prepared positions in the rearward lines. Mann
explained that the choice of these areas [targets 1012] was not always
based on what there was there at the moment, but on what could be
moved there during the battle. Some of the [other] aiming points were
villages through which the Germans might move up [sic] their armour
and guns. He made certain to mention that the ground attack would
commence at the same time as the air strikes on 7 August, in order to
take full advantage of the bombardment. The second phase, he said,
would have to proceed even if air support were not available, although
he noted that the second defence zone was the stronger of the two,
reflecting the changes in enemy dispositions over the previous two days.
Mann explained that cratering was acceptable on the flank targets (6,
7, and 9) in this phase, but that fragmentation and a blast effect was

for the entire operation.
52. In mid-July at AEAF, the Chief of Operations and Plans had discussed with
the Senior Air Staff Officer a proposed recommendation to Leigh-Mallory that
because the army was failing to take advantage of its successful close support and
interdiction attacks, there would appear little point in continuing the planned
attacks on rail centres and rail and road communications. . . . He considered that the
air effort expended might be better employed in a return to attacks on German Industries

needed over a wide area on the axis of advance. Because Bomber Command
normally used high explosive rather than fragmentation bombs,
the second-phase attacks were to be conducted simultaneously and
jointly by the two air forces. The Eighth, which did use fragmentation
bombs, would take on the centre targets. General Carl Spaatz, commanding
the U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe, objected that his aiming
points would be obscured by smoke created by the RAFs bombs.
After further discussion Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, SHAEFs
deputy commander,
suggested that in view of the difficulty of arranging the timing in
order to allow the smoke to clear from the target between the
bombing of Bomber Command and the 8th Air Force, and in view
of the doubt whether cloud conditions would be suitable for high
level bombing by 8th Air Force, it would be better for Bomber
Command to take on all the bombing in the phase 2 area.
To avoid obscuring the central targets, the flanks would be bombed
one hour before the army advanced. The centre would then be hit at Hhour,
Bomber Command ensuring the minimum of cratering effect.
Tedder also said that the southernmost target areas (10, 11, 12) were too
large to allow more than a very thin effect, at which point Leigh-Mallory
advised the employment of fighter-bombers to watch for the movement
of guns into those areas. The conference thus wound up with
decisions that the heavy bombing in both phases would be done by the
RAF, while air support in the exploitation phase of the operation would
be provided by Second TAF assisted by the Ninth U.S. Tactical Air Force,
with additional reconnaissance supplied by fighter-bombers of Eighth Air
Force.
While the conference proceeded, the changing enemy situation had
prompted some contingency planning at First Canadian Army Headquarters.
German movements obviously had Canadian Intelligence confused
as to the enemys order of battle. In the event of a general enemy
withdrawal from his forward positions prior to the beginning of the operation,
the first phase would commence with an assault on the second
defensive position at the original H-hour, 2300 on 7 August. The air plan
would go ahead, but with the Phase II targets substituted for targets 1 to
5.53 Ultra intelligence and the recent move of 12th SS may have led the
Canadian officers to engage in some wishful thinking, but the success or
failure of Totalize depended on having the right kind of fire support on
the right targets at the right time. Because the air plan was in large part

crafted in order to counter the SS divisions, it was essential to locate
them.
Canadian probing attacks near Tilly revealed that 1st SS was still
there. The 2nd Corps Intelligence staff was convinced that both regiments
of the Leibstandarte were holding the front near Verrières, and
concluded in the summary for 5 August that [i]n spite of reports to the
contrary today the infantry of 1 SS has not fallen back.54 Beginning that
same night, however, the division was relieved by 89th Infantry Division,
which took over the entire area formerly held by 1st SS and 9th SS
between the river Laize and the Caen-Mézidon railway. Army Intelligence
reported that interrogation of prisoners of war from 1st SS that
night had revealed information which might lead one to suppose a
major change was taking place. Almost immediately upon taking over
the line, a deserter from 89th Division arrived, saying they had been
told they were relieving an SS formation. He thought that 1 SS Pz Division
had withdrawn to BRETTEVILLE SUR LAIZE.55
Such a move would profoundly alter the complexion of the operation.
The 89th was considered a low-quality pocket division, made up mostly
of men under eighteen or over forty, including a large proportion of nonGermans.
It had just arrived from Norway, had not yet seen combat, and
was not expected to be capable of strong opposition.56 Instead of the stiff
resistance that was expected in Phase I, which provided the rationale for
the night bombing in the first place, 2nd Corps now faced one low-quality
infantry division that had taken over the sector previously defended
by two panzer divisions. The trade-off was that Simonds would now have
to confront both 1st SS and 12th SS in the battle to pierce the second
line. The Phase II bombing thus took on an increased significance.
By the next morning Simonds had learned of the relief from Army
Intelligence. At 1000 hours on 6 August he held a conference with his
divisional commanders to inform them of critical changes that were to
be made to the original Operation Instruction in light of the new information.
He was certain by then that the SS divisions had been relieved,
but was still unsure about their exact locations. Both Army and Corps
Intelligence believed that the Leibstandarte had stepped back to the
Bretteville-sur-Laize area.57 As for the Hitlerjugend, a directive Crerar

issued to his corps commanders that day appreciated that it was now
concentrated to the east of the Totalize battlefield. It could be expected
to counterattack in some strength and with determination, so the task
of Crockers 1st British Corps was to secure its own front and thus guard
the left flank of 2nd Canadian Corps.58
Simonds decided, based on the new enemy dispositions, to alter his
plan for Phase II. The original plan had been for 4th Division to breach
the second line and advance on the west side of the road while 3rd Division
secured the flanks and formed a firm base just behind. The Poles
were then to continue the advance on the east side of the road in Phase
III, in order to capture the high ground north of Falaise. In the amended
plan, Phase III was eliminated. Now both armoured divisions would
advance simultaneously in Phase II, straight through to their final objectives,
while 2nd Infantry and 51st Highland secured the right and left
flanks and formed a base on the Bretteville-sur-Laize line. Following the
Polish Armoured Division would be 3rd Division, which would then take
over the area extending southeast from Hautmesnil through Brettevillele-Rabet
to the high ground at Point 140.59
Simonds explained the change of plan to Crerar later that day,
observing that the thickening up of SS troops on the second German
line necessitates a widening of the frontage and increase in the weight
of attack in the second phase.60 Kitching and Major-General Stanislas
Maczek, commanding the Polish Armoured Division, saw the matter differently.
Kitching later complained that while 3rd Division was initially
to make the hole through which I would pass, the change, made only
twenty-four hours before the attack, meant that now both armoured
divisions would have to make the hole ourselves. Equally problematic,
within the wider corps area woods and the river Laize would restrict
each division to a very narrow front. This would limit the flexibility of
the tanks to manoeuvre and still allow the enemy to concentrate his
defences.61 Historian John A. English notes, siding with Simonds, that to
overcome the almost invisible German defense in depth . . . one had to
attack in depth. This was the conundrum of the broad front
approach.62 Furthermore, Simondss options were limited. As the goal
was Falaise, he had few alternative routes from which to choose. First
Canadian Armys Plans Section had considered, in early August, the possibility
of an attack that would outflank the German defences to the east

frontages and a lack of roads, and was rejected.63 It is difficult to imagine
what other course of action Simonds could thus have chosen.

0515 to 0525. During the landings there was
little opposition from enemy aircraft.
35. In phase I our surface forces kept to
their time table despite shelling by enemy shore
batteries. Batteries situated to the south of the
town were slow to commence firing but when they
did were particularly destructive. Further smoke
screens were requested to cover our landings, a
necessity which had already been anticipated and
additional smoke aircraft were already on their
way to the scene of action.
Phase 2 (0550  0730 hours)
(0640 hours) 37. The Western Commando
had been completely successful in overcoming
the battery position at HESS and killing all the
personnel. The final assault on this position
was assisted by a Squadron of Spitfires which
attacked HESS Battery at 0620 just before our
men were due to attack. This assistance was
successful and the attack was made immediately
our aircraft had finished. The CP of this Battery
was in a Lighthouse close by which had been
attacked by two Spitfires at first light. The
landing on the Beach 1½ miles to the West of
Dieppe (GREEN Beach) was also successful,
capturing the RDF station and destroying their
other objectives.
38. The Eastern flank (BLUE Beach) initial
attack had, however, failed. A second attack
made at approximately 0740 resulted in a small
penetration, which, however, did not succeed
in silencing the guns on the Eastern Headland.
In the main landing on Red and White Beaches
the tanks were held up by the inability of the
Engineers to land the explosives necessary to
blast a passage through the promenade wall,
with the result that the majority of the tanks were
stranded, and the infantry were disembarked
whilst the tanks were still immobilised. Large
white houses overlooking the Beaches gave
considerable trouble and bombardment by
destroyers was requested from our troops
ashore.
(0605 hours) 39. In view of these difficulties
a further smoke screen was called for on the
Eastern Headland BISMARK but no aircraft
were immediately available for this. The smoke
carrying aircraft were at once ordered to load up
with smoke bombs and take off as soon as they
were ready.
(0621 hours) 40. Earlier attacks had failed
to silence the Eastern Headland defences and the
gun positions (HITLER and GOERING) South of
Dieppe continued to shell the Beaches.
(0605-0615 hours) 41. Twelve Bostons
had already been ordered off to bomb HITLER
and were quickly airborne.
(0640-0645 hours) 42. ROMMEL was
also still giving trouble and the landing on BLUE
Beach had in consequence failed. The only
remaining Bostons were, therefore, detailed to
attack ROMMEL followed by a further 6 when
they became available.
(0723 hours) All these Batteries continued to
harass our troops and an attack was called for
on BISMARK. A Squadron of Cannon Hurricanes
had already been dispatched to be on call to
the Headquarters Ship by 0740 and a second
Squadron of Cannon Hurricanes was despatched
to be on call to the Headquarters Ship 20
minutes later.
43. Thus at the end of the second phase
the RDF Station, 5 light AA positions had been
captured and the gun battery behind the ORANGE
Beach had been demolished. Throughout this
period air cover was afforded to the troops
against moderate enemy fighter opposition; the
number of enemy aircraft patrolling the area at
any one time during this period did not exceed
one Squadron.
Phase 3 (0730  1050 hours)
(0730 hours) This third phase covers the
withdrawal to the Beaches.
(0752 hours) 45. At 0752 two Cannon
Hurricane Squadrons were ordered to engage
enemy E-boats which had been reported
proceeding south from BOULOGNE. Two
fighter cover Squadrons accompanied these
Hurricanes. At the same time a message was
received cancelling the support on BISMARK
and ROMMEL. The Air Force Commander was
always doubtful whether this latter message
was genuine, but had to act on it as information

was received within a few minutes that a second
landing in BLUE Beach had been successful.
At this time one Bomber Squadron was on its
way to bomb ROMMEL and was beyond range
of recall. Aircraft were also on their way to drop
smoke bombs on the Eastern Headland; these
were recalled.
(0830 hours) 46. Th e s i t u a t i o n h a d
meanwhile deteriorated on the Western flank.
Heavy opposition was also coming from the
Western Headland and the houses behind the
beach. Machine gunning and shelling continued
undiminished from the Headland and from
HINDENBURG. (0916 hours)
(0926 hours) 47. A Squadron of Hurricane
Bombers and a Squadron of Cannon Fighters
covered by two Spitfire Squadrons were ordered
to attack these positions.
(0940 hours) 48. The situation in various
areas continued to grow critical and due to
various delays the time scheduled for the
evacuation was deferred from 1030 hours to
1100 hours.
(0956 hours) 49. At 0956 the following
reply was received to the Air Force Commanders
request for a situation report:
Situation too obscure to give useful report. Air
co-operation faultless. Enemy air opposition now
increasing. Have you any questions.
(1004 hours) 50. A few minutes later a
request was received for a 30 minute smoke
screen along RED and WHITE Beaches from
1100 to 1130 hours: Thruxton was ordered to
prepare as many aircraft as possible with SCI and
as many aircraft as could be fitted were ordered
off for this purpose. The Military Commander
gave GREEN Beach third priority after RED and
WHITE Beaches for smoke, and 3 Blenheims with
an escort Squadron were detailed to this task.
51. At 1039 hours a request was made for
maximum fighter support against machine gun
positions on both Headlands.
(1039 hours) 52. Four Close Support
Squadrons were ordered to these attacks with
two Squadrons as cover.
(1047 hours) 53. A further call for support
against the Headland came in 20 minutes later,
by which time Squadrons were already on their
way. At this time it appeared that the LCAs were
arriving at WHITE Beach, ready to re-embark
the forces on shore. Thus at the beginning of
this third period the right wing of our landing
Pilots of Canadas No.401 Squadron group themselves around Air Marshal A.M. Bishop during his visit to
the unit in September 1942 to congratulate them on their performance during the Dieppe operation.

forces had made progress but those in the centre
including the tanks were held up.
54. Enemy air opposition had by now
increased considerably, 20 to 30 fighters being
seen continuously in the area until 1000 hours
when enemy bombers appeared escorted by
fighters.
(1050 hours) 55. The enemy employed
a considerable number of bombers from
aerodromes in Holland in addition to small
numbers from BEAUVAIS. To counter this
increased enemy activity and in order to cover
re-embarkation, which was about to commence,
the strength of fighter cover over DIEPPE
was increased from 3 to 6, and at times to 9
Squadrons. Heavy casualties were inflicted on
the enemy bombers who were now concentrating
on shipping and landing craft.
Phase 4 (1050  1410 hours)
56. The fourth phase marks the withdrawal
from the Beaches. During this time the gun
batteries BISMARK and HINDENBERG on the
East and West Headlands continued their intense
bombardments, and in many areas the situation
was more than critical.
57. Until the expedition had safely withdrawn,
frequent and urgent requests were received for
bombing and close support attacks in enemy
gun positions, and calls for smoke screens were
made.
58. At 1030 hours a most successful prearranged
attack was made by 24 Fortress
Bombers escorted by four Spitfire IX Squadrons,
on the enemy Fighter aerodrome at ABBEVILLEDRUCAT.
Some twenty-five tons of high explosives
and a large number of incendiaries were dropped.
Many bursts were seen in the North West
dispersal areas and on the run-ways whilst fires
were started in woods adjoining the dispersal
areas. Bursts were also observed on storage sites
and clouds of black smoke were seen rising from
the whole target area. This very accurate bombing
of dispersal areas and run-ways  bombs fell near
to at least 16 aircraft in those areas  caused
considerable confusion to the enemy, and he was
denied the use of his aerodrome for probably
2 hours, his aircraft being instructed to land
at alternatives. The ABBEVILLE control was
out of action until the evening, when a new and
unfamiliar voice came on the air.
59. This attack on Abbeville was followed by
a diversionary feint made towards OSTEND by
a Typhoon Wing in an endeavour to draw enemy
Air Forces away from Dieppe.
(1100 hours) 60. The enemy air activity by
this time had increased and he had altered his
Flight Sgt. Mehew Zobell, brought this Spitfire back safely home after the Dieppe affair despite the fact that his forehead
had been injured - not seriously - by an exploding cannon shell from an enemy fighter. The holes which the shell made in
the cowling of his cockpit are clearly visible. In the other picture, the severe damage to his rudder can be seen. Despite
this he made a perfect landing. His only complaint was that the medical officer would not allow him to fly during the rest
of the day. I missed a lot of fun, he said bitterly.

form of attack. The tactics of our fighter cover
were changed to meet this situation by adding a
high Squadron of Spitfire IXs at 23,000 feet.
(1200 hours) 61. Dur ing thi s pe r iod
bombing attacks were made by Boston Squadrons
on BISMARK and HINDENBURG.
62. Further attacks were also made by three
Close Support Squadrons and smoke was laid
between the East and West Headlands across the
port of DIEPPE to cover the final withdrawal.
63. The constant requests for bombing,
close support and smoke were met to the limit,
demands frequently being anticipated as a result
of the clear picture available in the Fighter Control
Room and Uxbridge. All types of Squadrons were
called on to operate a shuttle service.
64. It was decided that Tactical Reconnaissance
aircraft could serve no further useful purpose and
their operational flights were discontinued.
65. In the final withdrawal a maximum effort
was directed to protect our re-embarking forces
from both ground and air attack.
(1310 hours) 66. By 1310 hours it appeared
doubtful whether any more troops could
be evacuated. An hour later the last craft was
reported 3 miles from the French Coast. The
withdrawal from DIEPPE had been completed.
Phase 5 (1410  2245 hours)
67. As our forces cleared the enemy coast
smoke-laying aircraft laid a protective screen
between them and the enemys defences.

coming from the direction of Holland.

deterioration in the weather and the enemy took
advantage of the increasing cloud cover to send
out single bombers to attack our ships as they
neared the English Coast. One or two formations
of FW 190s were also employed for this purpose.
In addition to standing cover over the returning
convoy, 86 interception sorties were made.

71. The enemy reacted almost as had been
foreseen; at first he did not appear to appreciate
the scale of our effort and he used only 25/30
fighters in each sortie. As the day went on the
strength of his sorties increased to between
50/100 aircraft. At first fighter bombers, and
later, when the moves from Holland had been
effected, night bombers in increasing numbers
were used until all his resources on the Western
Front were in action.
72. Early in the day enemy air effort was
confined entirely to fighters patrolling the area
in small numbers. Occasionally dive attacks on
our ships were made from height. The German
control merely instructed his aircraft to go to
the DIEPPE area where large numbers of British
bombers and fighters were operating.
73. It was not until about 1000 hours, some
six hours after our assault, that our patrols
encountered enemy bombers. It would seem,
therefore, that these had not been at a high state
of readiness.
74. The first bombers came in small numbers
and were escorted by FW 190s. Later larger
formations up to 15 in number operated under
the main German Fighter Force which was
engaging our cover patrols. Reports from pilots
indicate that a small number of reserve training
bombers were included.
75. The German Bomber Force throughout
confined its attentions to our convoy and did not
harass our troops ashore. A bomber jettisoning
its bombs crippled HMS Berkeley shortly before
1300 hours. She was later sunk by our own
forces.
The attack on ABBEVILLE  DRUCAT at 1030
hours was undoubtedly successful in striking
at the enemys most congested aerodrome at
a critical period in the operation. This attack
was timed and prearranged to this end and it
undoubtedly succeeded in considerable reducing
the efforts of the GAF against our expedition.

Casualties
76. Details concerning air effort, serviceability
of aircraft, casualties to aircraft and personnel
and results achieved by the Air Forces during
operations at Dieppe are shown in Appendix C
to this report.
77. The very low rate of casualties suffered
in all types of Squadrons during each intensive
daylight operation in close support of a combined
expedition are of particular interest.
Administration
78. The concentration and redisposition
of Air Forces in No. 11 Group was for security
reasons undertaken as a reinforcing exercise,
under the title of VENOM.
79. No serious administrative difficulties were
experienced throughout the operation, though the
shortness of the period of activity did not perhaps
bring to light some of the difficulties which might
have arisen had it been more prolonged.
Communications
80. Communications on the whole were
excellent. Signals were promptly and clearly
received at Uxbridge. The majority of outgoing
messages from Uxbridge to the Headquarters
Ship retransmitted by Portsmouth, did not reach
the Military Commander afloat, so that requests
for Close Support from the Ship were often
repeated unnecessarily.
81. The Control organisation in the Ships
worked very efficiently and this system is capable
of further expansion and development.
82. Additional land line links to Uxbridge
for the operation worked fairly satisfactorily,
although some of the temporary lines were not
up to the high standard necessary.
83. The operations and Intell igence
Teleprinter Operators worked at high pressure
but were able to handle the traffic without serious
delays.
Conclusions
84. (i) This operation showed that such
expeditions can be successfully supported and
protected by home defence Fighters operated by
the normal Home Defence Fighter Organization,
assisted by forward direction through R/T in
ships. This efficient organization is fully capable
of so operating Air Forces to the limit of present
fighter range and is bound to be superior to any
alternative forward control scheme which could
never provide anything like equal facilities.
(ii) Landings on such a scale in occupied territory
in daylight effectively pin the enemy air forces
to an area enabling our supporting Fighters to
operate at height and in conditions best suited
to them. In existing circumstances the enemy is
forced to employ his night bombers in daylight,
at times unescorted by fighters thus sacrificing an
appreciable part of his limited bomber resources.
(iii) Close Support attacks by Cannon
Fighters are effective only whilst they are engaging
their targets, but they have no lasting material
effect on well protected defensive positions.
they are extravagant in as much as each aircraft
is in action for a few seconds only. To achieve
any lasting moral effect would demand such
a large expenditure of these Fighters that our
efforts in other directions would be reduced to
unacceptable proportions.
(iv) A very much higher standard of interservice
recognition is essential in combined operations.
As modern aircraft are all so alike, it is imperative
that all personnel have a very thorough knowledge
of and frequent practice in recognition.
(v) Airborne smoke is extremely valuable in
combined Operations. Smoke is often likely to
have better effect than bombing, particularly if it
is intended to protect surface forces against well
placed gun positions. It is essential, however,
to speed up the present rate of turn round for
smoke carrying aircraft and to be able quickly to
alternate between SCI and bombs and to change
over from one to the other on the ground in the
shortest possible time.

"al surrender"" of all of
North Africa, with hundreds of thousands of prisoners, and with abandoned equipment that
hasn't yet all been counted .
The stories told here were told at the front wherever armored troops were found .
LEADERSHIP
Platoon leaders learned in the North Africa fighting that to lead, you've got to be out
in front. LIEUTENANT HILLENMEYER of company ""H"", 1st Armored Regiment, said, ""As a platoon
leader, I learned that you've just got to lead your men . When you get out in front, they'll follow
you easily. If you're moving in sections, the platoon leader must go in the forward section .
And what's almost as important is the fact that every man must know what's going on . You've
got to take them into your confidence and explain the show to them . They'll always respond
with better fighting.""
(See Page 24)
SERGEANT BE KER of the 1st Armored Regiment told me, 2nd I quote : ""It's a funny
thing, being tank commander. You have got to run the crew, be stern, and show leadership . I
had a new driver -for an M3 tank . I told him to drive up a slope to a certain place and
then stop . He got excited and went all the way up the hill . I told him to back up to the right
place. He got excited again and went all the way back down the hill . He wouldn't listen to
the inter-phone communication so I hollered to the 37 gunner to stop him, as I had my head out .
Finally we stopped him and we drove up to a safe firing place and I asked him why he didn't
pay attention to me. Over night, I explained how I wanted him to drive and how I wanted him
to pay attention, and I told him if he didn't I would close his slot up completely and make
him drive blind. That fixed him . I think I have a good driver now.""
(See Page 28)
I was also told of how PRIVATE MOORE, ompany ""L"", 6th Infantry, led a charge of 20
men to recapture a hill from which his company had been driven . PRIVATE MOORE, through
*NOTE: Also see pages 21 and 46 . These accounts do not agree and should not agree because all
grades must exercise initiative and the application of principles varies according to circumstances .

/N rROOV r/oN
his own leadership, in the absence of any commissioned or noncommissioned officer, gathered
together a group of men and charged the hill, all standing up with the exception of two men
who crawled up, one to throw hand grenades into a machine gun nest and the other to shoot
the enemy when they came out.
LIEUTENANT OLONEL RINGSOK told me : ""Frankness with your subordinate leaders is
the biggest thing in leadership . The officer should be truthful . If he doesn't know, he should
admit to the noncommissioned officers that he doesn't know all the answers and that they
must work it out together . You can't impress the organization of the battalion too much in
the States . Let them learn it there rather than have to learn it here, for it is absolutely necessary
that-the men know the workings of a unit when leaders turn up missing in action and subordinates
take their places .""
(See Page 40)
Vft . RE ONNAISSAN E
""A reconnaissance of the field, if you are lucky enough to be able to make it, is the
most important thing I can think of,"" LIEUTENANT OLONEL HIGHTOWER told me . ""In tank
fighting nothing is more important than expert reconnaissance of your routes of advance and
withdrawal. Several times both we and the Germans have moved up on what we thought was
a good clear route only to find a dry wash, nine or ten feet high, blocking our way, causing
us to withdraw .""
(See Page 19)
LIEUTENANT HILLENMEYER, also of the 1sf Armored Regiment, said, ""Sir, if we're going
to get anywhere, we must put greater emphasis on good reconnaissance . I know of one
instance where we went into battle not knowing what was there . We saw the enemy tanks
go into Faid Pass and that night we had a dry run back in our concentration area . Next
day when the attack came off we found the thing was a blind-the pass was covered with
deadly antitank stuff . It plastered our one company that went in .""
(See Page 24)
STAFF SERGEANT' WILLIAM HAGLER of ompany ""E"", 1st Armored Regiment, related
this incident to me : ""At Medjes-el-Bab there was little or no reconnaissance. Our infantry attacked
in the morning . One platoon of tanks was supposed to follow the right flank, and it was
supposed to be protected by another platoon . We had no reconnaissance other than our own
on foot . We walked the tanks in. We had no orders other than to await a tank attack . The
following morning about 0900 hours, we lost two tanks to the 88-mm guns . The first was the
command tank . I went forward to get the crew and lost my tank by three 88-mm gun hits.
Subsequently the entire command tank crew was lost by mortar fire. I was wounded and
taken to the rear. I am confident that reconnaissance would have saved those two tanks . The
light tanks followed us around .""
(See Page 33)

LIEUTENANT Mc RA KEN of the 1st Armored Regiment told me, ""Everyone thought
Sergeant Jackson's buddy, Sergeant Hamner, was cracked when he remarked that he saw a
building moving around . But it was a German gun position . They are very smart and
use houses, sand dunes, or hay stacks as gun positions . The moving building turned out to
be a vehicle with windows painted on representing windows of a house .""
(See Page 32)
However, it was SERGEANT FRANK SABIN, of Headquarters ompany, 6th Armored
Infantry, who really summed up the whole subject of reconnaissance when he said, ""The battalion
commanding officer and the commanding officers of the companies do better when they
make reconnaissance. Seems like the battalion does 100% better when they do .""
(See Page 41)

TANK TA TI S
In discussing tank tactics with LIEUTENANT OLONEL HIGHTOWER, I was told, ""Generally
they (the Germans) try to suck you into an antitank gun trap. Their light tanks will
bait you in by playing around just outside effective range. When you start after them, they
turn tail and draw you in within range of their 88-mm guns . First they open up on you with
their guns in depth . Then when you try to flank them you find yourself under fire of carefully
concealed guns at a shorter range. We've just got to learnn to pick those guns up before
closing in on them .""
(See Page 19)
LIEUTENANT OLONEL HIGHTOWER then added, ""Take it very slowly . Germans do it
that way all the time. Do not shift gears once you start, particularly in the dusk, because the
backfires will give you away . Keep the tanks out of column at all times . Never travel in
column, travel in `V', line, wedge, but never in column. Stay off the roads . Get off the roads
and never use them. In this country, too, we've learned to move slowly so as not to reveal
our position . You can't boil up to battle at high speed without broadcasting your coming in
a bigcloud of dust.""
(See Page 19)
LIEUTENANT THOMAS B. RUTLEDGE of the 751st Tank Battalion said, ""One thing I
learned : the next time we move up, before we close up on the objective, it is a good thing to look
down on the ground in front of the objective and if you see anything that looks like the enemy
or enemy guns, fire away at it with canister . We were so close that with keen observation, even
two or three rounds or some machine gun fire would have downed many machine guns. I believe
this would save us a lot of grief afterwards . We know there are lots of mines, but
when approaching the objective we seem to forget those machine guns . So, instead of covering
4
/ N T R O D !/
r / O N
the ground in front of the. objective with machine gun fire, we thought only of the objective,
which was on the hill .""
(Sec Pagc 52)
SERGEANT LASLEY of the 1st Armored Regiment, who had been a tank commander for
eleven months and had been in several actions, told me, ""When you are fired upon, if you have
a good tank like an M4, you try to find out where the enemy is and fire even before you find
a good position. Of course, it is best to get under cover as soon as you can . You should go
from one firing position to another as a platoon . But at times, we must go on our own. Some
times you must act on your own because you can see the ground that you are going on better
than the platoon leader . The driver and assistant driver should assist in picking our targets .
They call be on the alert and pick out targets that the gunners can't see.""
(Sec Page 37)
Tactics as practiced by SERGEANT BUTLER'S platoon, of ompany ""I"" of the 1st Armored
Regiment, was to have one section of the platoon advance while the other section covered
it. He said, ""One must act on his own a great deal of the time . You can't wait to be told
when to fire or where to fire. When you see something which you think worth firing upon,
take the chance. The function of the officer is to keep the men together and tell them what is
going on. The soldier has to use his individual judgment .""
""You should keep your troops on the alert always, ready for quick movement,"" SERGEANT
BUTLER added as an afterthought .
(See Page 40)
TANK GUNNERY
LIEUTENANT OLONEL HIGHTOWER, in talking about our armored tank gunnery,
said, ""Bore sight to beat hell but don't let the boys try to do it at 1000 yards so the axis
of sight and tube coincide, because when you are shooting at 6000 yards there is no telling
where it will hit . Keep your sights parallel . Bore sight on a distant object ; the more distant
the more effective.""
(See Page 19)
Listen to what SERGEANT JAMES H . BOWSER of the 1st Armored Regiment says about
gunnery: ""The gunnery instruction they gave us in the States was good . No sir, I wouldn't
change it . There's just one thing you must remember when you're fighting Germans . When
you shoot at them they stop and try to kid you into thinking you knocked them out . Then
when you turn your back on them, they open up again. Sir, we shoot until they stop and then
keep shooting until they burn up . It's a good idea, too, to check your ammunition closely .
Once I had to climb out of a tank during an action to ram a bent shell case out of my gun
and then hurry back in before the machine guns got me .""

TANK MAINTENAN E
In tank fighting, one of the most important things is to keep your tank and its weapons
in good condition . In many cases you will be on your own, a long way from any maintenance
equipment . As LIEUTENANT NORMAN of the 1st Armored Regiment told me, ""You
don't get a Goddam thing done to the tanks unless you do it yourself-and don't delay doing
it. Bring lots of brushes to clean the guns .""
STAFF SERGEANT WILBUR R. WHITE of the 13th Armored Regiment said, ""When
full maintenance is not available, look out for certain things : battery, water, keep check on
control boxes in turret.""
He added, ""The night before this attack (at El Guettar) started, our M3 threw a
track. SERGEANT McVEY and I put it back with the tools we had on the tank . The captain
complimented us because if the tank had been left, Jerry would have shelled it when daylight
came.""
(See Page 49)
INDIVIDUAL PROTE TION
OLONEL HAINES, ommanding Officer of the 1st Armored Regiment, told me a story
of the difficulty he had had for a while getting one soldier to wear his helmet . The soldier
had claimed that it was too heavy . But the other day the soldier came to OLONEL HAINES
and said, ""I'll never be without this helmet again . You will never have trouble getting me to
wear it.""
When OLONEL HAINES asked him why, the soldier showed him the helmet and said,
""See this dent! Just look at it!""
(See Page 30)
LIEUTENANT OLONEL HIGHTOWER told me, ""Although we've knocked down several
enemy aircraft we find that our men are having trouble with their leads . You've got to shoot
planes as you would ducks . The big fault with our antiaircraft fire is that about 60% of it
does not have enough lead. Our boys don't seem to realize the speed of those ships . The .50
caliber machine guns, however, will keep them high. German pilots seem to despise the stuff .""
(See Page 19)
LIEUTENANT OLONEL HIGHTOWER then added, ""We've also learned that it's important
for everyone to know what to do with wounds, especially shock . Although 1 saw one man die
6
/NTROoU TION
of shock from a simple hand wound, I've also seen our men save almost 500 casualties by
prompt treatment of their wounds with sulpha drugs and proper treatment for shock . Most of
the sulpha drugs are administered by the men themselves . A couple of weeks ago one of my
sergeants fixed up a man who had been severely wounded on the head and neck when he
was blown off a tank. Today, the man is back in action .""
(See Page 19)
STAFF SERGEANT WILBUR R. WHITE said, ""When under artillery fire, stay in your tank
-it's better than any foxhole."" LIEUTENANT HOLTZMAN showed that he agreed with SERGEANT
WHITE when he said, ""The tank is the best slit trench in the world when shells or bombs are
falling . I feel safe in it and stick close to it at all times .""
(See Pages 49 and 35)
SERGEANT JOHN T. MAHONEY expressed his views as to personal security by saying,
""In a bombing attack, don't try to run too far from your half-track . Go about 20 . or 30 yards
and then hit the dirt.""
(See Page 43)
SERGEANT FRANK SABIN said, ""Dig good foxholes . We learned in Sbeitla Valley that
foxholes offered smaller area and less chance of getting hit by bombs and shrapnel .""
(See Page 41)
LIEUTENANT THOMAS B. RUTLEDGE told me the following incident : ""I gave the order
to abandon (the tank) to the right because the gun was on the left . As we opened the door,
machine gun fire started. I went to the front of the tank to see where it was coming from,
and it was coming from both sides . We flattened out and started crawling. I stayed behind
the rest with a Tommy gun. The driver was leading. One of those guns saw us and when
one man raised up it hit him in the tail, and another man was hit in the back and another in
the shoulder. Immediately I ordered everyone to freeze themselves flat to the ground.""
(See Page 52)
SERGEANT DuHAMEL of the 60th Infantry told me, ""We moved up into the hills here
night before last . Yesterday I got permission to go out scouting, and took a man with me .
""Today I came alone and didn't tell them I was coming, because I didn't want one of those
other men with me. It was because the men on patrol exposed themselves so much that I
went off alone today. The commanding officer of the other company up where I am, a second
lieutenant, I overheard saying he wanted to get away from this new group because they
exposed themselves so much .""Â°
(See Page 13)
SERGEANT WILLIAM T. ETRITGE of the 6th Armored Infantry had this to say : ""Three
main things that I think are important : the first is to keep your weapons clean-they won't
fire if you don't. Stay under cover. I have had men who were not under cover and they
haven't come back . Then get all the fire on the enemy that you can . It is best to keep very

talking while out in front . They never reported back .-TJ

quiet. At any time at night whenever you make a slight noise the enemy immediately opens
up with machine gun fire and mortars.""
(See Page 14)
""You can find anti-personnel mines if you watch closely as you go along . You can see the
three prongs sticking out . About seven pounds of pressure will set them off . We have taken
them out and put the pins back .""
SERGEANT LELAND A. SUTHERLAND also confirmed the need to keep down when he
said, ""The scouts drew enemy fire . All the machine guns fired and the men had to learn one
thing-that was to stay down. I lost three men . I can harp and preach but the men won't
get down. I have learned that artillery couldn't hurt you if you just got down in a foxhole
while the firing was going on .""
""I have no experiences to relate, but have had the hell scared out of me here for a
month or so. I have learned that we have to play for keeps . I think that my men are getting
smarter now. In our company we have not got many replacements . We got sixteen last
night. Everyone felt good to get them . I put my best men with them, I picked a good old
man for each new man . The old man showed the new one just how to dig his foxhole and
told him everything . We were sorry they were mostly from ooks' and Bakers' School . We
need riflemen.""
(See Page 16)
STAFF SERGEANT SEABORN DU KETT of the 6th Armored Infantry wanted me to tell you
this : ""The first thing is to keep your head and have good concealment . Keep your eyes open
because the Germans are pretty smart and you have to keep awake to get them . At Kasserine
Pass I know we lost some men by going to sleep . You got to be awake all the time .Â°
We lost men by wanting to go to sleep . They seem to get the idea that they should have rest
more than anything else. They don&t . get scared until it's too late .
""Up at Kasserine Pass a man didn't carry out orders that he should have, orders to
move to the top of the mountain, and some of those that went to sleep didn't come out . It is
necessary to obey orders .""
(See Page 17)
PRIVATE JA K MOORE of the 60th Infantry, who led the charge I have already referred
to, had this to say, ""It seems like everything the enemy uses is designed to harrass a
man. They start firing at night and the guns seem to crack overhead, and it makes it seem
as if they were right on top of you . The tracers seem to have curves on them . But if you
wait, and take it easy, you can soon tell where they are. They have snipers that don't have
much of a chance of hitting anything but scare the hell out of you . I am not afraid of it
now anymore but last Monday we took a pretty good beating from their artillery . It was our
second attack, and many men were pretty scared, but you readily realize that if you are in
the ground it is pretty ineffective .""
(See Page 17)
Â°NOTE: Another story of guards not being alert to investigate noise or trouble : Eight Italians came
into an American position, killed two officers and four men, and captured six men . This incident was later
reported to higher headquarters as an attack by forty enemy tanks .

/N T JQ O D (/ r / O N
STAFF SERGEANT FRED W. ERDWINS of the 6th Armored Infantry told me, ""1 have never
seen a man killed in a slit trench, but I did see three men killed who did not start in digging as
the others did . Entrenching tools are very valuable and almost as necessary as a man's arms .""
(See Page 47)
PRIVATE BLAIR H . ONARD, 6th Armored Infantry, said : ""In this war there is no front.
The enemy may come from the rear as the enemy tanks did to my company . We saw the tanks
at the rear, but thought they were our own . One half hour later they moved up and shot
hell out of our half-tracks .""
(See Page 47)
LIEUTENANT WILLIAM S. NORMAN, 13th Armored Regiment, suggested, ""In training,
get recruits used to sound of artillery shells. Many men shiver and shake and are terrified
of artillery fire. But remember when you hear the `freight trains' coming, most of them aren't
coining anywhere near you."" Then he added, ""The most important lesson is not to worry .
Respect Jerry, but don't worry .""
(See Page 48)
A
TRAINING
Many men offered suggestions for increasing the efficiency of the basic training they
had taken here at Fort Knox . I mention a few of them here to show how these battle scarred
veterans are thinking .
When I spoke with SERGEANT SWATZLANDER of the 1st Armored Regiment, he said
to me, ""Sir, if I had a brother coming in combati .I would want him to know well the functioning
of the tank and all its guns . I would want him to know personal care-just how long to
stay with a damaged tank before leaving it . After it has been hit it is a big fire hazard . You
stay as long as you can . If you have to leave, you do it quickly .""
(See Page 28)
When I asked SERGEANT HAGLER of the 1st Armored Regiment what was the most
important thing for a tanker to know, he answered, ""Everything . Every man must know his job
and the tank commander must know them all .""
(See Page 33)
LIEUTENANT HOLTZMAN suggested to me, ""Try to arouse interest in learning first aid .
The most valuable asset when a tank is hit is to know the use of sulpha powder and pills and
the treatment of burns, puncture and laceration wounds ."" He also added, ""Everyone in the
armored force should be able to drive a tank. Everyone should be able to do everyone else's
job so that he can carry on under casualties .""
(See Page 35)
SERGEANT FRANK SABIN of the 6th Armored Infantry had several things to say : ""1
wish I had learned in the States to have a lot of real fire over my head. We got scared awfully
9
r N K E #Q 5 / N ~!/ N/ 5 / 4
at first . Am, kind of firing over your head would help . It would still pay if you lost one or
two men when you considered whole armies . The way to do it is to crawl and see where they
hit, then either cross to the right or to the left . Just look and use your head . As soon as
they fire fall flat on the ground, and when they reload jump up and run while they do. Experience
and guts count.
""The driver should be ready no matter what happens . Should know all guns, etc. Back
in the States they didn't teach that, but we have to know it here . In garrison I didn't care so
much for work, but I do here . I don't mind it here. New men aren't well-trained. I had a
hard time when I was first in the front lines . I was gun shy, scared. New men should work
themselves in. They shouldn't be in too big a hurry . They must be cautious.""
(See Page 41)
SERGEANT GEORGE LELAND, 6th Armored Infantry, said, ""Men in the States should
be trained to dig foxholes. It will save lives . Foxholes are better than slit trenches because
they protect a man more and you can fire out of a foxhole and you can't very well out of
a slit trench .
""If I went to the States to train men the first thing I would stress to a new man is
leadership. I would make the man have confidence in his leader, and train him in every
weapon, camouflage, and to dig foxholes; also to cover up tin cans . (Tin cans reflect light
and give away positions .)
""If you are going to harden a soldier up, keep him hardened up and don't let him get
soft . Start hard training and keep it up . Men should be hardened before they go into combat .Â°
""In the States we didn't have enough night training . Men should be trained in use of
stars for navigation . All men should be trained to know organization in the States .""

SERGEANT JOHN D. MAHONEY of the 6th Armored Infantry said, ""I found at Maknassy
that too many men stand around the ,.observation point and give the position away . We lost a
man in a counter-battery fire that way .
""We have the most need for training in the .30 and .50 caliber machine guns. Not
all our men can read a compass or a map. We should have had some training in booby
traps. Don't pick up things . Watch where you step.
""I don't think the recruit training is tough enough . The new men are too soft. The
more training the better. We need harder training right now so we won't get soft . Every
man should know how to fire every gun in the battalion and be able to operate the radio .""
(See Page 43)
LIEUTENANT KENNETH D. WARREN of the 6th Armored Infantry had the following suggestions
with reference to training: ""Some of our replacements have been riflemen only. We
need men trained in the machine gun and in the 37-mm gun. We have had to train most of
our mortar men. None knew the 75-mm gun . Men should be trained to dig in a machine
gun as well as themselves. A machine gun that can be seen will draw fire just as a vehicle
will .""

APTAIN D. A. KERSTING told me, ""Recruits need much more night training before coming
over. I remember spending only 4 nights out in all my night training, but here we spend
40 nights out of every 45 doing night work ; night attack, night outpost, night patrol, etc .
Night training should not have to be learned here when the men have to do it for record .
""The organization of the unit should be known thoroughly, not only by the leaders but
by the privates and by everyone else . You should know what every person does .
""Don't shoot at any plane except when attacked . There should be no shooting at night
even if bombed . All leaders should know compass reading and terrain study thoroughly .
You should always drive without lights except for blackout lights away from the front lines .""

GENERAL
To the things the soldiers and officers at the front in Tunisia tell I add the following
observations :
The American tin hat is the finest military washing and laundry equipment ever
given a soldier. With it soldiers can keep themselves and their clothing clean . Remember
a dirty soldier is a bum and mighty liable to be a sick bum .
Our American soldiers have been our best diplomats in Africa . The soldiers like children;
they have given them part of their rations to eat, a piece of candy or a piece of chocolate .
The kindliness of our soldiers to these people has made friends not only of the children but
of their families and all the people, and this is a priceless asset .
The smart American soldiers learned to -give respect and consideration to people who
talk and dress differently from themselves . The dumb American soldier is liable to jeer at anything
strange. This dumb American soldier must be taught very carefully to have good manners,
otherwise he can do more damage in a few minutes than a hundred smart men can ever
atone for. You can figure for yourself how you would feel if a British soldier, or a French
soldier, or an Arab soldier, jeered at the way you trained, or shot, or talked, or ate . Our
soldiers and our officers do represent our country and they absolutely must represent it
properly .
A British officer of the widest tank experience told me that our M4 tank was the
finest tank in the world. He thought it was better than anything else the United Nations
had and was better than anything the Germans had. He thought it would be the best tank
for the next five years. The American soldiers in Africa who fought in these tanks feel the
same way. The confidence and satisfaction of our soldiers in their equipment was well expressed
by SERGEANT BE KER when he said, ""I like the M4 . I look at the German tank
and thank God I am in an M4 .""

INTERVIEWS AT THE FRONT
SERQEANT R . DuHAMEL, Headquarters ompany,
3rd Battalion, 60th Infantry . Djebel
bou Douaou, 3 April 1943.
I was sent as a replacement . I sailed
from New York 5th March ; landed in Oran
19th March ; sailed from Oran 21st March;
arrived Phillipeville night of 24th March ; left
Phillipeville by truck 25th March ; arrived at
a post near onstantine 25th March; left
26th March ; arrived Ain Beida 27th March ;
left Ain Beida 31st March ; arrived 9th Division
31st March ; was on outpost on this
mountain 1st April.
I am one of 100 replacements of the 60th
Infantry who are on this section of the mountain
range. Some of these men never fired
the rifle. Some, including myself, have never
thrown a live hand grenade. The men have
little respect for authority . They always talk
back as if something was being put over on
them, and never take their orders cheerfully.
The men talked as they came up the mountain
in spite of being cautioned not to . (The
older soldiers, who had been there ten days,
nodded emphatically that this was the case .)
We moved up into the hills here night
before last. Yesterday I got permission to
go out scouting, and took a man with me .
Today I came alone and didn't tell them I
was coming, because I didn't want one of
those other men with me. Yesterday I guarded
some prisoners back. The other men are
quieter today. It was because the men on
patrol exposed themselves so much that I
went off alone today. The commanding officer
of the other company up where I am, a
second lieutenant, 1 overheard saying he
wanted to get away from this new group
because they exposed themselves so much.
13
I left my blankets and pack carrier back
with the APO (Rear echelon of the 1st Armored
Division), and am in with another boy
in a cave. He had four blankets . I didn't
know we were going to stay out . I asked,
and no one knew anything . We left with
one day's rations.
On the way to the front we had good
food and shelter, were in pup tents part of
the time. I had a ride in a truck to a steam
bath near Ain Beida . In camp near onstantine
we were lucky, we had mattresses with
straw. I left my extra clothes back at the
APO; it is all in one barracks bag. The
rations on the way up were good-if they
were "" Â° rations, they were heated .*
(At 2200, 4 April, Germans made a night
attack on this position. It was repulsed by
hand-to-hand fighting and grenades .)

For five miles the track we followed to the foot of
the mountain was under observation and within range
of various German guns, and for that reason our
party was limited to one peep load of 3 . The Germans
frequently fired guns, up to 88's even at small
vehicles . The officer who drove the peep had perfected
himself in the SOP for single vehicles to avoid
fire. This procedure is to use a change of pace .
Drive at a relatively high speed long enough for the
Germans to figure a lead, then change abruptly to
a relatively low speed and keep this speed about
long enough for the Germans to figure a new lead,
then go fast again . If this is done properly a vehicle
is hard to hit . We were not fired upon .

"f deal with brigade orders, the fire plan and
administrative matters.18 Foulkes, who had been appointed to command the
division by General Crerar days before Simonds arrival, had a poor reputation as
brigade commander and no combat experience, so Simonds was determined to
supervise every aspect of the divisions training.19 As a follow-up to
CONQUEROR, Simonds attended a Tactical Exercise without Troops (TEWT)
conducted by 5th Brigade and Exercise JANG conducted by the three divisional
field regiments.20
Throughout March and April 1944 Simonds orchestrated a series of
exercises all directed at breakout attacks and sustaining an advance along a single
thrust line. Study periods for all commanders and staffs down to GSO2s were
organized, one of which was attended by General Montgomery. The corps, under
First Canadian Army, was to advance to the River Seine on the eastern flank where
From Captain to Corps Commander

it was assumed they would meet a German army withdrawing in good order to
defend the river line. The Seine in the Canadian sector was a major obstacle, and
2nd Division began training for the assault crossing of a tidal estuary in mid-April.
Much of May was spent near the mouth of the River Trent practicing for Operation
AXEHEAD, the designation for the Seine crossing. The infantry battalions of 4th
Armoured Division used the River Medway for their assault boating and bridge
crossing experience.21 Operation AXEHEAD was cancelled once it became
evident that the German armies in Normandy had been routed but no one could
have foreseen the scale of the defeat of the German armies in May 1944.
The documents reproduced below offer a remarkably detailed picture of
Simonds ideas on leadership and command during this period of preparation for
OVERLORD. The ideas expressed were based on his experience as a staff officer
and his service commanding at the brigade and divisional level. They constitute
one of the most important sets of statements about leadership and command in
Canadian history and deserve to be read with care.

To All Formation Commanders 2nd Canadian Corps
OPERATIONAL POLICY  2 CDN CORPS
1. A corps operates in a territorial corridor covering the
communications along which it moves and is maintained. The number
From Captain to Corps Commander
11
and types of divisions, independent brigades and artillery groups included
in it will depend upon the nature and width of the allotted frontage and
the task of the corps. It is impracticable to lay down a clear-cut doctrine
for the employment of a corps when its composition is, and must be,
variable. It is practicable to define the probable roles and methods of
employing the different types of divisions operating within the corps under
specific conditions.
2. The probable role of 2 Cdn Corps will be to pass through a beachhead
which has been secured by assaulting forces and attack, wear down
and destroy German troops which oppose it, within the corps corridor
defined by the Army Commander.
3. Once a firm lodgement has been secured on the continent and we are
able to build up reserve formations within a beach-head, the German
armies will probably try to sap the strength of Allied armies in a series of
defensive battles. The main battles will be fought on successive positions
chosen by the Germans. When driven from one position the Germans may
give ground, gaining time to re-organize on the next rearward position on
which they have elected to fight again. 2 Cdn Corps will be prepared:
(a) to follow up and harass whenever the Germans give ground
(b) attack when the Germans make a stand to fight a defensive
battle
4. The sequence in which these types of operations may occur cannot be
foreseen. Once a firm beach-head has been established, the Germans
may decide that the ground on which they find themselves is unsuitable
for a main battle and they may step back to a position some distance in
the rear. Alternatively, they may stabilize the initial beach-head
operations in front of a position on which they are prepared to fight. In
the first case the immediate operation of 2 Cdn Corps would be to follow
up; in the second case the first operation would be an attack against an
organized defensive position.
FOLLOWING UP A GERMAN RETIREMENT
5. When the Germans decide to give ground to some depth they may
endeavour to gain time by extensive demolitions in conjunction with the
liberal use of mines and booby traps. Demolitions may be covered by
small rear parties, including machine guns, multiple light flak and antitank
guns. The purpose of these detachments will be to inflict casualties
and impose caution on the advancing troops. Such rear parties operate
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
12
on the hit and run principle and they will seldom make a prolonged
stand. Determined infiltration, with quick artillery support controlled by
forward observing officers will usually dislodge these rear parties. Such
detachments are most likely to be found covering demolition of the
crossing of a continuous obstacle or narrow bottle necks.
6. Where the ground favours it, the Germans may occupy a rearguard
position on principles similar to our own. They may intend to hold such a
position to gain a specific period of time  from midday until it is dark, 24
hours, 2 days, 3 days. Such positions will be strong in machine guns,
anti-tank guns, and will be backed by reserves of tanks, self-propelled
guns and small bodies of infantry. They are unlikely to be wired or
protected by extensive minefields. The Germans so disposed will seeoff
attempts at infiltration by our leading troops. A well prepared and
co-ordinated brigade attack organized by leading divisions will usually
succeed in overrunning these rearguard positions.
7. Either infantry or armoured divisions may lead in a follow-up.
Divisions will be directed on centres of front-to-rear and lateral
communications as their objectives. The securing of those restricts the
enemy power of manoeuvre and lateral switching of formations, whilst the
opening of front-to-rear communications for all types of traffic is essential
to maintain the momentum of our own advance, and the opening of lateral
communications, as they are secured gives us the power to switch
formations and concentrate against any part of the enemy defensive
position when the Germans make a stand.
8. Either infantry or armoured divisions should advance on a single
thrust line, disposed in depth on a one-brigade front, opening a two-way
maintenance route as they advance. Leading brigades should be preceded
by strong reconnaissance across the whole front of the division. In the
case of the infantry division, infantry brigades may be passed through one
another, the leading brigade being directed on to ground of tactical
importance and there forming a firm base through which the next brigade
can be passed. Thus, the division will be disposed in depth with
successive brigades established on a firm base covering centres of
communication. In the case of the armoured division, the infantry or
armoured brigade will lead, depending upon the suitability of the country
for the employment of infantry or armour. When the infantry brigade
leads the armoured brigade forms the firm base from which it operates
and when the armoured brigade leads the infantry brigade forms the firm
base from which the armour operates.
From Captain to Corps Commander
13
9. When the enemy detect the thrust line on which the division is
operating they tend to concentrate their strength astride it. It is then
advantageous to move a reserve brigade to a flank to force the enemy to
dissipate his strength on a wider frontage. When a second brigade is
thrown wide of the leading brigade in this manner, it may be possible to
site the divisional artillery so that the whole of it may support either
brigade. But the weight of artillery support must NOT be divided.
10. Advancing on a single thrust line with brigades disposed in depth had
the following advantages:
(a) The divisional artillery, even if reinforced by a proportion of
medium and field artillery from the corps, is only sufficient to
support attack by one brigade.
(b) If the Germans are using demolitions extensively, the
divisional engineers are only sufficient to open and maintain one
all-weather two-way traffic road.
(c) With the division in depth, with rearward brigades
established on firm bases, the leading brigade may be pushed along
its thrust line without worrying about flanks. Any move of the
enemy against a flank can be dealt with by a counter-thrust from
one of the brigades held in depth.
(d) The leading brigade, operating from a firm base, can act
with great boldness, for there is always a solid anchor on which
recovery can be made if the Germans make a sudden, strong
counter-thrust.
(e) By passing one brigade through another the staying power of
the division is preserved, so that on coming up to the main position
on which the Germans intend to fight, the division is fit for a main
attack.
(f) The depth in which the division is disposed given great
flexibility for manoeuvre.
11. The divisional artillery and engineers should be centralized under the
control of the CRA and CRE, respectively, and operate in support of the
leading brigade. The necessity for strong reconnaissance across the
whole divisional front has already been indicated. This must include
engineer reconnaissance across the whole divisional front, so that
engineer examination of alternative crossings of obstacles proceeds
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
14
simultaneously and an early decision as to the place of crossing may be
made without premature commitment of engineer resources to what may
later prove to be a difficult and slow crossing.
12. When an infantry division leads in the advance an armoured regiment
will be placed under its command, and one medium regiment will always
be either in support or under command of a forward division, whether
infantry or armoured.
ATTACK
13. When the Germans decide to stand and fight a defensive battle, attack
without adequate reconnaissance and preparation will not succeed. The
attack must be carefully organized and strongly supported by all available
artillery. The frontage of attack must be limited to that on which really
heavy support may be given. The essence of the German system of
defence is the counter-attack. His forward defences are not thickly held in
terms of men, but are strong in automatic weapons and well supported by
mortars, sited up to three or four thousand yards in rear of forward
defended localities. These mortars are capable of bringing very heavy
fire to bear in front of, or within, the German defensive position. A well
planned infantry attack, with ample fire support, will penetrate such a
position with comparative ease, but the first penetration will stir up a
hornets nest. As long as fresh reserves are available the Germans will
counter-attack heavily and continuously, supported by self-propelled guns
brought up to close range and by any mortars which have not been overrun
in the initial assault. The success of the offensive battle hinges on the
defeat of the German counter-attacks, with sufficient of our own reserves
in hand to launch a new phase as soon as the enemy strength has spent
itself. The defeat of these counter-attacks must form part of the original
plan of attack which must include arrangements for artillery support and
the forward moves of infantry supporting weapons  including tanks  on
the objective. Further, in selecting the objectives, the suitability from the
point of view of fighting this battle of counter-attacks must receive
important consideration. The following points must be considered in the
initial planning:
(a) The depth of initial objectives. To over-run the German
mortar positions requires penetration of his forward defences to a
depth of some four thousand yards. Unless these mortars are
dislodged, or dealt with by a pre-arranged counter-battery
programme (this is often very difficult, owing to the siting of the
From Captain to Corps Commander
15
mortars behind very steep cover) the effect of mortar fire makes
mopping up and reorganization on the objective a most difficult task
for the infantry. The Germans do not hesitate to engage a position
on which their own troops are still holding out.
(b) The phase of the attack at which the bulk of the artillery is to
be moved forward must receive early consideration. There is bound
to be a pause during this phase when the leading troops on the
objectives are going to be without the full support of the artillery.
This is the period at which the employment of all available air
support is most useful to tide over the gap. When the Germans
really stand to fight, it is seldom that the full depth of their defences
can be penetrated without a forward displacement of the bulk of the
artillery.
(c) The way in which the Germans support their infantry in the
counter-attack must be clearly understood. They move tanks or selfpropelled
guns to within close range of the objective they are trying
to retake. These do not support by neutralizing fire, in the ordinary
sense, but with aimed shell fire directed through telescopic sights at
a range at which individual infantry dispositions can be picked out.
The moral and material effect on our own troops of this type of fire
is considerable.
14. Any one of the following have proved effective in making the German
tanks or self-propelled guns stand off at a range which greatly reduces
their effect:
(a) Anti-tank guns well up with the leading infantry.
(b) Tanks following close behind the leading infantry.
(c) Medium artillery concentrations directed onto the enemy
tanks or self-propelled guns by a forward observing officer with the
leading troops.
The initial plan of attack should legislate for at least two of these forms of
support being available to leading infantry on arrival on their objective.
15. For a defensive battle the Germans generally dispose their main
position behind an anti-tank obstacle or thick mine-fields. The initial
attack, therefore, must be made by infantry to secure gaps through
minefields or a bridgehead across an obstacle.
16. The infantry division is the sledge-hammer in the attack against an
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
16
organized defensive position, for it is strong in infantry and has the
staying power to carry an attack through in depth. The armoured division
is a weapon of opportunity for it has not strength enough in infantry to
carry through an attack in depth through an organized defence and still
retain fresh infantry to co-operate with the armour in more fluid
operations for which it is specifically designed. The armoured division,
however, must be prepared to deal with a rearguard position, for after we
have made a successful break through a defensive position the Germans
will try to cover their withdrawal and reorganize behind a rearguard
formed some distance in rear of their main position. The armoured
division, on passing through to exploit, may find their task that of clearing
a way through such a rearguard position, before the can disorganize the
enemys further withdrawal by thrusting deeper.
17. In the planning of an attack, as in all military operations, the correct
allocation of troops and simplicity of command arrangements are of great
importance. The correct allocation of troops is best assured if each
commander thinks in terms of formations or units two below his own
command. Thus the divisional commander should think in terms of unit
tasks and the brigade commander in terms of squadron or company tasks.
By grouping tasks so that each group of tasks comes within the
power of achievement of each of his immediately subordinate formations
or units, each commander will arrive at a correct allocation of troops
without breaking up existing organization  the latter always a bad
practice in battle where team work counts for so much. Each commander
should explain to his immediate subordinates how he visualized the tasks
two below his own command when he allots them their tasks and issued
his orders. It simplifies command arrangements if each distinct phase of
an operation can be carried through to completion without changes of
responsibility in respect to command and changes of commanders of
supporting arms working with the infantry or armoured commander
concerned. Operations should be phased accordingly. A new phase 
the transfer of responsibility between units and formations and their
commanders for continuance of operations in a given area of the
battlefield  necessitates a pause and pauses always give valuable time to
the enemy. The higher the level at which transfer takes place the longer
the pause necessary (a company can be quickly passed through another
company  to pass one battalion through another takes longer  to pass a
brigade through a brigade is a matter of hours). It is therefore
advantageous to operate formations and units in depth on narrow
frontages, giving them staying power, rather than on wide frontages
From Captain to Corps Commander
17
necessitating early relief by passing through new formations or units. If
on examination, a plan of attack shows complications in command
arrangements or a number of apparently unnecessary phases or pauses, it
is a good indication that the allocation of troops has been badly done and
the whole plan should be reconsidered.
18. A sound, simple plan bases upon:
(a) The ground
(b) Enemy dispositions and probable intentions
(c) The support available
(d) The characteristics and capabilities of our own arms and
troops
And pressed home with resolution, will usually succeed. Complicated,
involved plans seldom succeed.

To All Formation Commanders 2nd Canadian Corps
EFFICIENCY OF COMMAND
1. If well trained, directed and led, the Canadian soldier is unsurpassed
by any in the world. Coupled with a rugged courage, ready adaptability,
initiative and amenability to sound discipline, the average standard of
intelligence of our soldiers is very high indeed. If properly directed in
battle, this intelligence is a great asset, for it makes troops very quick to
take advantage of the breaks on the battlefield. But if indifferently
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
18
directed or led, this same intelligence becomes a great disadvantage, for
Canadian soldiers are quick to detect a badly planned or organized
operation or wavering indecision in leadership, and their confidence is
more easily shaken than is the case with a more stolid soldiery. They
result in failure with heavy casualties and a loss of confidence requiring a
long time to recover. The responsibility which falls to those who
undertake to lead Canadian troops in battle is not a light one.
2. In battle, every command from the highest to the lowest, is a one man
job and a whole time job. Once he has made his plan, communicated it
clearly to his subordinates and made certain they understand what they
have to do, a commander must be looking and thinking ahead  thinking
of what the enemy may be doing, how they may react and planning his
own future moves. This he cannot do unless he has full confidence of his
subordinates. He cannot concentrate his attention on the future if he is
worrying about the capacity or determination of his subordinates to do
their duty. He will be much dependent upon their knowledge and
judgement in representing to him the situation and condition of their
troops and this in turn will influence his own assessment of a situation. A
commander must have subordinates in whim he has full confidence  if he
tries to carry weaklings in battle, his own duties will suffer
correspondingly. This may well result in a failure with serious
consequences and is an injustice to the troops.
3. I regard it as a first duty of every commander and commanding officer
to see to it that the command of his subordinate formations or units is in
fit, competent and energetic hands. In this matter there can be no
compromise and I consider a commander or commanding officer who
tolerates ineffective subordinates is himself unfitted for the responsibilities
of command. There is no lack of material to provide first class leadership
in all levels of command in the Canadian Army. It is the duty of every
commander to see that the best use is made of this material. Commanders
who for reasons of age, character, inefficiency or indifference are unfitted
to hold command in the field, must be removed and those who sow
promise of ability to carry higher responsibilities must be tested and given
opportunities.
4. As a guide to commanders in assessing their officers, I attach as an
annexure a list of the qualities which I consider are essential. They are in
no sense in any order of priority  all must be present in some degree.
Some of these qualities are inherent and some may be acquired. It must
be recognized that many men who are quite prepared to serve their
From Captain to Corps Commander
19
country to the best of their ability, have a ceiling beyond which they
cannot go.
5. In judging the usefulness of officers to the service a commander is
justified only in having regard to military qualities. Personal friendships,
length of service and past services rendered in other capacities must not
be permitted to influence judgement as to the usefulness of an officer now
in his present post or a post for which he is being considered, except
insofar as the last indicated special abilities. I specially caution
commanders against allowing personal prejudices or considerations other
than the military usefulness of officers, to influence their judgement. They
must carefully and conscientiously examine each doubtful or promising
case and act as their conscience dictates. Each case should be discussed
with his superior commander before action is taken. Doubt must not be
used as an excuse for doing nothing. Everyone makes mistakes and
mistakes may be made, for battle is only the final test and we cannot wait
for that to set our house in order. If in doubtful cases, injustices may be
done, bear in mind that it is better to do injustice to an individual than to
the many for whom that individual will be responsible and who will suffer
the consequences if he fails in his duty.
REMOVAL OF OFFICERS
6. I fully appreciate that the removal of officers who may have given long
and faithful service, particularly when they may be personal friends with
whom one has been associated in the same regiment, is a most distasteful
duty. Nevertheless, it is a duty that must be faced and a commander who
shirks it is unlikely to possess the resolution to drive through a difficult
situation in battle. It is a duty too easily postponed and I will remind you,
that as long as an ineffective commander remains in command of a
formation or unit, the training, efficiency and morale of all the troops in it
suffer accordingly. Consideration of its effect on an officers family has
occasionally resulted in dilatory action in dealing with those who are
believed to be ineffective. Such matters must not receive consideration
and if they come to the mind of a commander dealing with such a case he
must answer this question:
I know this officer has given long and faithful service and he and
his family may suffer if I take action to remove him. But he is
responsible for the training and leadership in battle of some
hundreds of Canadian soldiers, who are voluntarily risking their
lives in the service of their country and who also have families
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
20
and friends. Just because I do not know them, or their families
and friends as well as I know this officer, am I justified in taking
the risk that their service and sacrifice may be nullified, out of
consideration for him?
7. Officers who commanders of commanding officers consider unsuitable
to their posts will be recommended for removal on an adverse report or
recommendation for change of employment. I require that these reports
shall be strictly honest, stating clearly the reason why the officer is
considered unsuitable. Recommendations for other employment will only
be made when the initiating officer has first hand knowledge that the
officer under report is full qualified and conscientiously believes him
competent for specific employment. Otherwise, they will be recommended
for review by higher authority or for a disposal. I will not subscribe to a
recommendation that an officer be employed in a training capacity, if he
has not proven a success in a unit, unless he is being removed for age or
physical disability alone.
RECOMMENDATION FOR PROMOTION
8. Promotion will be based upon promise of ability to perform a task in a
higher sphere and not upon past services rendered except where the latter
clearly indicate special abilities. Length of service in a particular
appointment does not in itself establish any claim to advancement.
Assessment must be based upon the constructive contribution made by an
officer in the appointment he is holding, not upon the length of time he
has held it. Opportunities must be taken to test promising officers in their
administrative and tactical ability to carry the responsibilities of a higher
command. All commanders will carefully review recommendations for
promotion submitted by them through their formations, and in doubtful
cases will take steps to test and amend previous recommendations as
required.
9. I cannot stress too strongly the very high importance which I attach to
this question of efficiency in command. In the stress of action mutual
confidence between a commander, his superior commander, his
subordinate commanders and his troops is vital to success. With the most
careful combing out and selection, taking into account all the qualities on
which it is possible to base sound judgement, there will still be a
proportion who cannot stand up to the final trial of battle itself, and only
the actual test of battle will show it. No pains must be spared to ensure
that these are very few in number.
From Captain to Corps Commander
21
10. 2nd Canadian Corps will go into battle wit most of its units untried
and may be involved in heavy fighting from the outset. Their first real
action comes as a shock to the best of troops and only good direction and
leadership can bring them through with a heightened instead of a lowered
morale. Courage in leadership is not enough. Cool headed direction and
skill must be there also. This requires the application of a sound battle
training in actual battle. It will not be there unless troops have been
trained and are led into battle by fit, competent and determined
commanders.

ESSENTIAL QUALITIES IN THE LEADER
1. These qualities are in no sense listed in any order of priority. All
must be present in some degree. For instance, drive and self-confidence
unless balanced by knowledge and judgement may be positive dangers. It
is the degree and balance in which they are present in an individual which
will determine his service ceiling.
2. Certain of these qualities are inherent and certain may be acquired 
thus knowledge, physical fitness and skill at arms may be acquired, given
the mental and physical capacity. It is the duty of every commander to
develop the art of leadership in those under his command and
commanders should mark for special training and trial, those who have
the inherent qualities.
MORAL QUALITIES
(a) Character  Resolution, determination and the drive to get
things done. The generation of good ideas and intentions becomes
useless theorizing unless they show results in the form of high
morale, battle discipline and fighting efficiency of a formation or
unit. A man who originates good ideas and intentions but who is
unable to get them put into practice may be useful in pure research
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
22
or in an advisory capacity, but is quite useless in any executive
command. A man who has the character, deter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"characteristics are possessed in varying degree by different
types of tanks. The characteristics dictate the manner
of employment . All types of tanks are limited by their
restricting vision devices.
b. Light tanks, as compared to medium tanks, have less
fire power, lighter armor and armament, greater speed, and
better maneuverability . They are particularly fitted for-
(1) Feeling out and developing weak spots in the enemy
position through which medium tanks may attack .
(2) Screening the advance against light enemy resistance.
(3) Leading an attack against an unarmored enemy weak
in antitank defense, when speed is essential .
(4) A fast maneuvering force to exploit the success of other
tanks .
(5) Maneuver to flank or rear to strike the enemy command
posts, communication centers, reserves, and vital
installations .

c . Medium tanks, because of their greater fire power, guns
of heavier caliber, increased armor protection, and shocking
power are used to-
(1) Lead an attack against an enemy whose position and
strength are known .
TANK PLATOON
3-4
(2) Support by fire the attack of either light or medium
tanks .
d. It is essential that tank crew members know the strength
and weaknesses of their tank and its weapons . Furthermore,
they must know the strength of their weapons as compared
to enemy weapons likely to be encountered.
14. OPERATION .-The tank platoon is the smallest tank battle
unit . It normally operates as part of the tank company .
However, it may operate as an independent unit as advance,
flank, or rear guard or on similar missions .
a. Methods.-Tanks operate by surprise, fire and maneuver,
and in mass. The violation of these fundamentals will
lead to ineffectual effort and perhaps disaster .
(1) .Surprise.-Surprise is gained by striking the enemy
at an unexpected time, from an unexpected direction, with
all strength possible. Speed of movement, use of covered
approaches, and coordination of fires assist in gaining surprise
. Seek to surprise the enemy but do not let yourself
be surprised . Give the enemy credit for being as capable
as yourself. Do not underestimate his ability . Do not become
careless. Expect the unexpected and be prepared for it .
(2) Fire and maneuver.-An advancing unit is covered by
the fl re of weapons in stationary position. This is important
as the tank in the open is not only extremely vulnerable
but movement, dust, and restricted vision make the locating
of new targets extremely difficult. Tanks in defiladed position
can quickly locate and promptly bring fire upon hostile
weapons that fire upon the advancing tanks . This procedure
of fire and movement may be by section, platoon, or company.
(3) Mass .-Concentrate effort . Do not waste strength on
numerous unimportant targets . Strike on a key position with
all power that can be mustered. If this falls, others may
then be taken . If effort is made on several positions, the
enemy may easily destroy you by concentrating successively
on each attacking element .
b. Coordination .-Coordination of effort, that is, timing of
all elements, is essential . An uncoordinated effort violates
the fundamental of the use of mass . Therefore, in attack,
time the movement of the tanks and the opening of fire by
4 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
supporting weapons or supporting tanks so that maximum
effect is obtained . Teamwork is essential .
c . Initiative and aggressiveness.-In order to obtain success
in battle, leaders must exercise initiative and act aggressively .
A small force acting under direction of an aggressive, alert,
leader can overcome a much larger force whose leader is slow
and nonaggressive. Do not let the enemy have time to get
set . Conversely, do not rush headlong into battle with no
plan of action . Think clearly, give clear orders, then act
fast .
d . Striking weakness .-Seek to strike the enemy where he
is weak in antitank defense. Do not drive headlong against
strong antitank defense. Bypass it or call for assistance to
reduce it .
e. Mission and echelons of attack(1) The mission of
tanks in the armored division is to attack and destroy vital
hostile installations such as command posts, communication
centers, supply installations, reserves, and artillery.
(2) The mission of tanks in the separate tank battalions
is to assist infantry, cavalry, or motorized divisions to advance
by destroying hostile machine guns, personnel, arid vital
installations .
(3) A tank attack will usually be launched in three echelons,
each echelon in a series of waves . ,
(a) The first echelon of attack, preceded by neutralization
by combat aviation and artillery, if available, is directed
against the antitank defenses, artillery, command posts, and
other rear installations . (See FM 17-33 and FM 17-32.)
Tank, platoons of this echelon destroy first the enemy antitank
defenses and second, enemy artillery. They attack
enemy infantry only when hindered by it in fulfilling their
primary missions .
(b) The platoons of the second echelon follow the first
echelon at such distance that the enemy will not have time
to re-form his antitank defenses, These platoons destroy
hostile automatic guns and personnel and clear the way for
the advance of infantry . Antitank guns passed over by the
first echelon must be silenced by the leading waves of the
second echelon. (See par . 38c.)
(c) The tank platoons of the third echelon advance with
4
TANK PLATOON 4
the infantry, destroy hostile machine guns passed over by
the second echelon, and hostile personnel . The mission of
this echelon is to assist the advance of the infantry. They
may lead the infantry attack if resistance is still heavy.
If resistance has been broken by the first two echelons, tanks
of the third echelon will follow the infantry, prepared to
attack isolated resistance as necessary. These tanks also
protect the infantry from counterattack, particularly of
mechanized forces.

SECTION III
WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION
â¢ 9, GENERAL .-The tank is armed with several weapons of
different calibers each of which is provided with more than
one type of ammunition . The tank crew must be carefully
trained in the characteristics of these weapons, their capabilities
and limitations, and the proper use of each . The
gunner and tank commanders must know instinctively what
weapons to use and the proper type of ammunition for each
target .
â¢ 10. DESCRIPTION,-a . Depending upon the type of tank, the
weapons available are the caliber .30 machine gun, the 37-mm
gun, and the 75-mm gun. In addition, the tank has 12
grenades, fragmentation, incendiary, and smoke, and the
individual weapons of the crew, submachine gun and pistol .
b. The machine gun is an antipersonnel weapon . When
fired from a stationary tank it may be effective at ranges
up to 2,500 yards . However, it will normally not be used
beyond 1,000 yards . From a moving tank not equipped with
the gyro stabilizer, the machine gun should not be used at
ranges greater than 300 yards . With the gyro stabilizer,
ranges are the same as from a stationary tank . The M1919A4
caliber .30 machine gun cannot deliver sustained fire like
the M1917 water-cooled gun . Caliber .30 armor piercing ammunition
will penetrate the shield of antitank weapons at
200 yards.
c. The 37-mm gun has three-types of ammunition : cannister,
high explosive, and armor piercing .
(1) Cannister ammunition is used against personnel at
ranges up to 200 yards. (See FM 23-80 and FM 23-81 .)
(2) High explosive ammunition is used against unarmored
weapons in position, such as machine guns or antitank guns,
from an unprotected side . It is no good against armored
vehicles or bunkers .
(3) 37-mm armor piercing ammunition is effective against
most hostile light and medium tanks up to a range of 800
yards . It is also used against emplacements .
30
TANK PLATOON
d, The 75-mm gun is equipped with armor piercing, high
explosive, and smoke shell,
(1) Armor,piercing ammunition is effective against most
hostile tanks up to a range of 1,600 yards. The armor piercing
shell itself is effective against unarmored vehicles beyond
limit of vision of the firer, normally 2,500 to 3,000 yards.
(2) High explosive ammunition is used against antitank
guns, machine-gun emplacements, and occasionally against
personnel . It is effective beyond the limit of vision (see (1)
above) . By indirect fire with an observer, it may be used at
ranges of 7,500 yards .
(3) Smoke ammunition is effective as in (1) and (2) above .
It is used to screen antitank guns so that the tank may move
to a more favorable position . The smoke cloud from this
projectile is effective 50 yards downwind and the smoke element
burns for 10 seconds . The smoke is placed in front of or
on the target. For the greatest effect, fire to the windward
and just in front of the target. If wind direction cannot be
determined, fire just in front of the target on the line tanktarget.
Note direction of smoke cloud and fire another shell
if necessary. If wind is blowing indirectly toward you, fire
in or just behind the target . The smoke shell is also effective
against personnel and is incendiary .
E 11 .'CONSERVATION OF AMMUNrTION,-Each exercise scheduled
for company training must include training in ammunition
conservation . Although exercises are conducted without
ammunition, this subject must always be kept in mind .
During exercises, the 37-mm and 75-mm gunner should be
required to simulate firing and assistant gunners should keep
track of the number of rounds the gunner has simulated
firing . When all ammunition is fired, the gunner ceases
firing. This is one of the principal ways in which troops
can be trained in conservation of ammunition . If promiscuous
simulated firing without thought of ammunition supply
is permitted, wasteful habits will be developed . The tank
commander requires frequent reports from gunners concerning
ammunition supply . The chart below shows in a startling
manner what a comparatively small amount of ammunition
is available .

CHAPTER 3
CONTROL, ORDERS, AND RECONNAISSANCE
â¢ 12 . CONTROL,-a. Purpose.--Control is essential to coordinated
action . Loss of control leads to uncoordinated and
uneffectual effort . The platoon leader must at all times be
able to direct the maneuver of his platoon and to concentrate
the fire power of the platoon as desired,
b . Tactical control.-The platoon leader controls the platoon
initially by clear, definite orders as to direction of attack,
zones, and objectives. During the attack he controls movement
by means of radio orders and flag signals . Less frequently,
orders will be given to assembled tank commanders
during lulls in the fighting.
c . Fire control .-For fire control of individual weapons by
the tank commander, see Field Manual for the weapon concerned.
For list of Field Manuals and Technical Manuals,
see FM 21-6 . Prior to the attack the platoon leader points
out known targets and indicates which weapons are to fire
on these targets. For the advance, he designates tanks to
guard to the front, right, and left . (See FM 17-12, 23-80,
23-81, and 23-95 .) ' During the attack the platoon leader by
radio directs the fire of his platoon or of a .tank or section
upon certain targets if these targets have not already been
adequately engaged .
â 13 . ORDERS,-a. Initial orders are given to the assembled
tank commanders from a point from which as much as practicable
of the area over which the platoon is to advance can
be seen . If this is impracticable, show the zone and direction
of advance on a map, sketch, or aerial photograph . Indicate
objectives and rallying points . Make the order brief
but clear . The order should include-
(1) Information of the enemy and terrain .
(2) Mission of the company .
(3) Mission of the platoon .
(4) Fire support, that is, mortar, assault gun, or artillery .
(5) Attack position .
(6) Direction of attack .
54
TANK PLATOON
1 3-14
(7) Objectives.
(8) Formation of platoon .
(9) Scheme of maneuver, that is, attack straight to front
or one section making envelopment, orders for each section .
if platoon does not attack in one wave.
(10) Time of attack or signal for the attack,
(11) Rallying point.
(12) Alternate rallying point .
(13) Special signals, if any.
b. During, the advance, orders are given by radio or by flag
signal, except during lulls in combat, when section leaders
or tank commanders may be assembled for receiving orders .
FIGURE 46.-Do not give orders from map or by description alone if
you can reach a position from which terrain and enemy may be
pointed out .
â 14 . RECONNAISSANCE .-..a. The tank platoon is not a reconnaissance
unit although at times it may be used for
reconnaissance purposes. When on purely reconnaissance
missions, its functions are as described in FM 17-20 . This
paragraph covers employment and battle reconnaissance .
b. The tank has limitations as a reconnaissance vehicle due
to limited observation and noise . However, in many situations
tanks must be used for reconnaissance because of their
55
14
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
armament and armor protection . Much of the employment
reconnaissance, because of these restrictions and also to prevent
discovery of the presence of tanks, must be made on
foot. However, every effort should be made to thoroughly re=
connoiter the terrain and the enemy positions . Employment
reconnaissance may be classified as hasty and deliberate .
FIGURE 47.-Give order from point where terrain and enemy can
be seen .
i
(1) When attacking from march column or when making
a deep movement into enemy held terrain, deliberate reconnaissance,
because of the lack of time, may not be possible .
In such case the platoon leader makes a hasty map
reconnaissance, gains all the information he can from his
company commander, and passes all information along to
his tank commanders . He tentatively selects his route of advance
from the map or carefully studies the route designated
by the company commander. He notes what will apparently
be difficult places, places where cover Is meager or lacking,
and available cover . As he advances, he moves from observation
point to observation point and continuously studies
the ground to the front and flanks.
(2) (a) During combat, reconnaissance Is continuous . The
platoon leader and individual tank commander constantly
56
TANK PLATOON 14
observe in order to choose routes, select positions, and find
enemy installations . The platoon leader must keep his company
commander informed concerning the situation, He
should constantly ask himself the following questions :
1. Where am I?
2. Where is the enemy?
3. What is my mission?
4. What is the enemy doing?
5. What weapons is he using?
6. How can I best use the terrain?
(b) In his reports to the company commander, the platoon
leader should answer all or part of the following questions :
1. Where am I?
2. What am I doing?
3. Where is the enemy?
4. What is the enemy doing?
5. What weapons is he using against me?
6. What is enemy's strength?
7. What is on my flanks?
8. What are my losses?
9. What am I going to do?
(3) In a coordinated attack, particularly In the penetration
of a position, there will usually be more time for reconnaissance.
If infantry or reconnaissance units are in contact
with the enemy and time Is available after receipt of
orders (see FM 17-22), the platoon leader, section leaders,
tank commanders, and drivers if possible, reconnoiter the
ground from the attack position to the line of departure .
From an observation point, the zone of advance is studied
as far forward as practicable and routes for each tank
selected . Maps or aerial photographs are studied to determine
character of terrain beyond, the limit of vision . This
reconnaissance cannot be too detailed .
c. During battle, reconnaissance is continuous to discover
enemy positions and weapons, routes of approach, detours
around Impassable ground, and anything that will affect the
progress of the platoon .
d. The platoon leader must keep his company commander
fully informed of the results of reconnaissance. When reporting,
be sure to give your own position .

CHAPTER 4
MARCHES
15. GENERAL .-For detailed discussions of marches, see FM
17-10, 17-50, 17-32, 17-33, and 25-10 . For security on the
march, see chapter 5 .
a . A good march places men and equipment at their destination
at the proper time and in condition to fight . The success
of a march depends upon good march discipline which
can be obtained only by practice and rigid enforcement of
march rules .
b . The platoon, except when detailed on security missions,
marches as part of the company. The platoon leader, when
contact with the enemy is not imminent, marches at the head
of the platoon and is responsible for the proper distance from
the unit ahead . He frequently observes to the rear to check
on his platoon . When contact is imminent, platoon leaders
will usually march at the head of the company and platoons
are conducted by the platoon sergeant,
c. Radio silence is maintained when in the presence of the
enemy and as otherwise ordered. However, radio receivers
are turned on and tuned to the battalion or other frequency as
directed in order that immediate air alarm may be transmitted
to all tanks .
d . A march must not be considered as a joy ride . All men
must be alert . Weapons must be ready to repel a ground or
air attack. Tank commanders observe from the turret and
keep close watch for enemy air or ground troops and for distance
to the tank ahead .
e . The following should be particularly stressed (see also
FM 17-32) :
(1) Keep proper distance from vehicle ahead.
(2) Glance to rear occasionally to observe march of other
vehicles .
(3) Watch for air or ground attack .
(4) Keep to right of road when there is two-way traffic .
Travel in center of high-crowned road when there is one-way
traffic but watch out for vehicles trying to pass .

platoon precedes the company or battalion from an assembly
position to the line of departure and protects from surprise .
The covering detachment moves on a broad front, 100 to 200
yards between tanks, and precedes the leading echelon by
500 to 1,000 yards .

OFFENSIVE ACTION
.
SECTION I
GENERAL
â¢ 30. GENERAL .-Offensive action of armored force units is
discussed in FM 100-5 and 17-10 . The tank is primarily an
offensive weapon. Opportunity is sought at all times to
exploit its characteristics of fire power, mobility, armor protection,
and shock action .
â¢ 31 . FORMATIONS The various formations described herein
are suited for particular types of operation . They should
be practiced constantly so that one formation maybe quickly
assumed from any other formation . (See FM 17-5 .)
a. Line.-This formation develops great fire power to the
front . It is suitable for leading waves of the attack when
heavily supported by other weapons . It has no depth. It is
useful for a covering force .
b . Line of sections.This formation might also be column
of sections . It does not develop as much initial fire power
to the front as does line . . However, it lends itself readily to
fire and maneuver, one section occupying firing positions to
protect the advance of the other . The formation is easy to
control .
c. Column .-This formation develops little fire power to
the front. It is useful primarily for approach marches,
passing through heavy woods, and passing defiles . It is easy
to control
d. Echelon .-This formation is useful for a flank platoon .
It develops great initial fire power either to the front or flank .
It is difficult to control .

WEDGE INVERTEDWEDGE
FIGURE 107 .-Formations .
e . Wedge,-Wedge is a modified line-of-sections forma
tion . It affords good fire power to the front and either flank,
It is easy to control as far as direction is concerned . However,
its ire power is difficult to control due to the fact that
the platoon leader is not in a position to see his sections
readily.
122
TANK PLATOON
31-32
f . Inverted wedge .-Without radio, this formation is difficult
to control as far as direction is concerned. However,
when radio is operating ; the platoon leader can keep his platoon
under close control -as, he is able to see all tanks and at
the same time search the terrain for targets . He can by
radio readily direct the movement of either section . This
formation often results in combat when the platoon leader
sends one section on an enveloping movement, covers its
movement by the fire of the other section, and orders both
sections to assault when the enveloping section is in position .
IN 32 . INSTALLATIONS .-The installations with which the tank
platoon or section is primarily concerned are the assembly
area, attack position, line of departure, and rallying point .
a. Assembly area.-The assembly area is an area in which
troops preparing to attack are assembled . In this area the
tank platoon checks tanks, makes necessary adjustments on
tanks and equipment, refuels tanks, checks on food and water,
and receives information of the enemy and of the terrain .
Orders for the attack may be issued in the assembly area . .
Usually the general plan of attack will be given here and .
final orders issued in the attack position . The assembly
area is normally beyond hostile medium artillery range .
b . Attack position.-The attack position is the last covered .
or concealed position before the line of departure is reached . .
Here last-minute checks are made on vehicles and final Ordersissued.
Here the final coordination with infantry is effected . .
Tanks must not stay in the attack position more than a few
minutes. A long stay will cause surprise to be lost and will .
expose the platoon to hostile artillery fire .
c . Line of departure.-The line of departure is a well
defined, easily recognizable terrain feature such as a small
stream line or edge of a woods . Separate lines of departure
may be given for individual platoons or companies . This is,
particularly true when a portion of the unit is making an
envelopment .
d. Rallying point,The rallying point is a position where
the unit reorganizes after the attack . It should be a welldefined,
easily recognizable terrain feature. It should afford
concealment . It is usually in front of an objective. An_

contained therein must be repeated in order to insure
coordination
â¢ 59 In every unit standing operating procedure is prescribed
by the commander whenever practicable This procedure
covers those features of operations which lend themselves
to a definite or standardized procedure without loss of
effectiveness The adoption of such procedures will save time
in the preparation and issuance of orders minimize the
chances for confusion and errors when under stress of combat
and greatly simplify and expedite the execution of operations
in the field (See FM 0 -5 )
COMMAND POSTS
â¢ 60 For convenience of operation in campaign the headquarters
of a large unit is divided into a forward and a rear
echelon When desirable headquarters of smaller units may
be similarly divided
The forward echelon consists of the staff agencies immediately
required by the commander for assistance in tactical
operations The rear echelon consists of the remaining staff
agencies which have administrative duties
â¢ 6 The command post is the location of the forward
echelon of a headquarters All agencies of signal communication
center at the command post
62 In the selection of a command post consideration is
given to the disposition of troops in the plan of operations
routes of communication requirements of signal communication
space for staff activities cover and concealment
In the case of divisions and larger units the presence of
existing wire lines is important
Remote location of a command post with -respect to subordinate
units places an unnecessary burden on the means
of signal communication delays the transmission of orders
and information and makes tactical control difficult
Through the use of motor transport a command post can
be moved quickly over a considerable distance Frequent
changes in the location of the command post are avoided
particularly in large units In large units before a change
of location is made the necessary means of signal communication
for the new command post must be established
33
63- 68
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â¢ 63 A commander must keep superior and subordinate
units informed of the location and contemplated movement
of his command post
â¢ 64 Each large unit announces the location of its command
post and when practicable the location of the command
post of each of its major subordinate units In rapidly mov'-""
Ing situations it â¢ may be necessary to direct subordinate
units to select and report the locations of their own command
posts In closely coordinated operations requiring the
movement of command posts each large unit may designate
its own axis of signal communication by naming the probable
successive locations of its command post so far as such locations
can reasonably be foreseen and may similarly assign
an axis of signal communication to each of its major
subordinate units
â¢ 65 On the march a command post may move by bounds
along a designated route or it may move at a designated place
in a column
â¢ 66 In combat the location of command posts for small
units in proximity to a good observation post and for large
units in proximity to a suitable landing field is desirable
â¢ 67 The ability of mechanized units and parachute troops
to strike quickly in rear areas indicates the necessity of locating
command posts well forward both in the offense and
defense A forward location assures a certain degree of all
around protection by the combat troops; the command post
will not so easily be cut off from the units it controls and the
nerve center of the command is favorably located to meet
rapidly changing situations
â¢ 68 The maintenance of secrecy as to the location of command
posts particularly of large units is of great importance
They are the special objectives of hostile airplanes mechanized
units parachute troops and cavalry This threat
makes it necessary not only to provide security against surprise
attack from either the air or ground but also to use
great care not to disclose their locations to such troops
Concealment from the air is of major importance Traffic in
and out of command posts is rigidly controlled Landing
fields dropping and pick-up grounds and radio stations are
placed at a distance Signs to mark their locations and the

routes thereto are used sparingly-when the danger is great
not at all; in place of signs guides are posted to point the
way and messengers are given more precise instructions
SIGNAL COMMUNICATION
â¢ 69 The efficient exercise of command and the prompt
transmission of information and instructions require the
establishment of reliable means of signal communication
Signal communication is effected by technical means and by
messengers Entire dependence cannot be placed upon any
one means ; alternate means must be provided (See FM 24-5
and FM -5 )
â¢ 70 Every commander is responsible for the establishment
and maintenance of the signal communication system of his
unit and for its efficient operation as a part of the system of
the next higher command Signal communication systems
must be simple flexible and properly used
The establishment and maintenance of signal communication
between superior and subordinate units is the responsibility
of the superior commander; between adjacent units as
directed by their common superior A unit supporting another
by fire is responsible for the establishment and maintenance
of signal communication with the supported unit
â¢ 7 The various means of signal communication are so
employed that they supplement each other Those requiring
great expenditure of effort and materiel are not installed
when the service required can be effectively performed by less
elaborate means
â¢ 72 When headquarters are in movement signal communication
is maintained between and within columns by means
of vehicular radio airplanes and motor or mounted messengers
73 The command posts and advance message centers are
the control points in the initial installation of the signal
communication system Early information is given to the
signal or communication officer of a unit relative to projected
operations and the location and movement of command posts
in order to facilitate the prompt establishment of signal communication
The necessary instructions therefor are prepared
by the unit signal or communication officer in accord-
35
73- 80 FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
ante with the directions of the commander Communication
officers of higher units maintain close cooperation with the
signal or communication officer of the subordinate unit
N 74 Message centers are operated at the command posts
of all units down to and including battalions and at the rear
echelons of headquarters of large units by the signal coma
munication personnel of the command Message centers
assist the commander and staff by coordinating the transmission
of outgoing orders reports and other messages with
the available signal agencies and by expediting the delivery of
incoming messages In general the cryptographing and decryptographing
of messages are the responsibility of the
message center
2 75 Advance message centers are established whenever
needed for the reception and relay of messages Information
as to their location is always transmitted to the troops
Advance message centers are frequently employed in the
reconnaissance operations of large units as collecting points
for messages of several reconnaissance detachments
0 76 The message center is not responsible for those messages

Transmitted directly by the writer to the addressee by
telephone or personal agency
b Handled by the military or civil postal service
c Local messages between staff sections of the same headquarters

â¢ 77 The message center transmits messages in accordance
with the classification as to urgency indicated by the writer
For classification of messages in accordance with the urgency
of handling see FM 0 - 0
â¢ 78 The writer does not ordinarily designate the particular
means by which a message is to be sent If he desires a
message transmitted by a particular means he so marks it
â¢ 79 Means of signal communication include wire radio
visual and sound communication pigeons airplanes and
messengers
â¢
80 Wire communication (telephone telegraph and telegraph
printer) constitutes the basic technical means of

OPERATIONS
80- 82
signal communication for the infantry division and this
larger unit headquarters It will not however always be
available for signal communication between forces operating
at a considerable distance from each other between troop
units and the higher command on the march and between
the advanced troops and the rear in combat Rapidly
changing situations such as a pursuit or retreat restrict the
practicability of its employment The possibility of failure
to function in critical situations must also be reckoned with
A wire system must therefore be supplemented by other
means
Although wire communication is a relatively safe means
there is always the possibility of hostile interception When
such interception is practicable it is inadvisable to employ
wire communication for 'the transmission in clear text of
plans which are not to be executed immediately
â 8 Radio communication is especially applicable in spanning
distances between widely separated mobile forces between
ground and air and in the fire-swept zone of the
forward area It is less vulnerable than wire communication
to hostile fire and is therefore a valuable supplement to wire
systems in combat It is subject however to static to
hostile interference to interception and to location by the
enemy
Interception of radio messages must be presumed Discretion
must be used even in the sending of messages in code
or cipher When prompt action is called for the commander
must decide whether the urgency of sending the message in
the clear outweighs the value to the enemy of information
contained therein Radio transmission in the clear is justified
in situations when the time available to the enemy is
insufficient for exploitation of the information contained in
the message
During certain phases of operations use of radio must be
rigidly restricted or' it may even be prohibited by higher
commanders
82 Visual signal communication (lamps flags pyrotechnics
panels) is not suitable for long messages or over long
distances but finds especial application for communicating
within and between small units and with airplanes by a few
short signals in accordance with a prearranged code (See
FM 24-5 )
37
83- 90
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â¢ 83 Sound communication is used chiefly to spread an
alarm as a means to attract attention and to transmit short
prearranged messages
84 Homing pigeons are a means of communicating from
front to the rear when other means have failed
85 Airplane messengers may be employed when distance
intervening obstacles on the ground or other factors of the
situation prevent the use of other means or when more rapid
transmission is required than can be otherwise accomplished
!~ 86 Signal communication between airplanes and ground
is accomplished by means of radio visual signals and drop
and pick-up messages In combat dropping and pick-up
grounds are established near unit command posts as required
On the march they are established near the location of higher
commanders and at points along the route of march Dropping
and pick-up grounds are identified by the display of
panels Moving vehicles designated to receive dropped messages
are provided means by which they can be easily identifled
from the air Airplanes in flight may be used to relay
radio messages between ground forces
0 87 Sole reliance cannot be placed upon the technical
means of signal communication Their absence or failure
to function does not relieve the commander of his responsibility
of keeping higher lower and adjacent units informed
of the situation Each commander provides for the transmission
of orders information and reports by means of
messengers
â¢ 88 Messengers are dispatched by the most efficient means
of transport available In hostile territory it may be advantageous
to use airplanes or armored vehicles or to provide
an armed escort In combat mounted bicycle motorcycle
and motor messengers are employed as far forward as hostile
fire and the terrain will permit Runners are used in the
more advanced units
â¢ 89 For covering long distances relays of messengers may
become necessary When relays are established ' relay (connecting)
posts are generally placed at well-marked points
on the messenger routes

CHAPTER 9
THE Or viiNSIVE
SECTION I
GENERAL
THE OBJECTIVE
0 450 An objective sometimes may be attained by maneuver
alone ; ordinarily it must be gained by battle A sound tactical
maneuver has a great influence on the successful outcome
of battle
8 45 The purpose of offensive action is the destruction of
the hostile armed forces To facilitate the accomplishment of
this purpose the commander selects a physical objective such
as a body of troops dominating terrain a center of lines of
communication or other vital area in the hostile rear for
his attack The attainment of this objective is the basis of
his own and all subordinate plans This objective should
have the following characteristics :
a Its capture must be possible within the time and space
limits imposed by the assigned mission
b Its capture should assure the destruction of the enemy
in his position or the threat of its capture should compel the
enemy to evacuate his position
c It should produce a convergence of effort
d It must be easily identified
e Its capture should facilitate contemplated future operations
PI 452 The objective having been selected all components are
directed in coordinated effort towards its attainment Actions
which do not contribute to this purpose are avoided
9 453 Sound tactical maneuver in the offensive is characterized
by a concentration of effort in a direction where success
will insure the attainment of the objective On the remainder
of the front are used only the minimum means necessary to
deceive the enemy and to hinder his maneuver to oppose
the main attack
97
454-460
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
DISTRIBUTION OF FORCES
â¢ 454 In the offensive troops are distributed into two or
more principal tactical groupings : one or more main or decisive
attacks in which the greatest possible offensive power is
concentrated to bring about a decision and one or more
secondary or holding attacks whose mission is to render
maximum assistance to the main attack
Main attack groupings are designed to secure the objective
and to destroy the hostile force Secondary attack groupings
are designed to hold the enemy in position to force him to
commit his reserves prematurely and to an indecisive location
and to prevent him from reinforcing the front of the
main attack
â¢ 455 In each tactical grouping the mass of the available
means of combat is concentrated in a main effort and is applied
in a decisive direction
â¢ 456 Main attacks are characterized by narrow zones of
action by strong support of artillery tanks and other supporting
weapons by effective support of combat aviation and
by deep echelonment of reserves
â¢ 457 Secondary attacks are characterized by lack of depth
reduction of reserves to the minimum maximum fire power in
the attacking echelon and by wide zones of action for the
attack units They will therefore usually be assigned limited
objectives initially
â¢ 458 When it is impracticable to determine initially when
or where the main attack is to be made the commander retains
his freedom to act by disposing his forces in great
depth by holding out strong reserves and by maintaining
close control of his supporting weapons
â¢ 459 Attacking echelons once committed to action lose their
immediate availability for employment in the execution of
other missions Deployed and under fire they can change
front only at the risk of incurring heavy losses The commander
can materially influence the course of an action once
begun through the employment of reserves fire support and
combat aviation
0 460 In selecting the direction for the main attack the
terrain must be carefully studied The choice of the front
98
OPERATIONS
460-463
on which the main attack and the main efforts of subordinate
units are made often is determined by the possibilities which
the terrain offers for effective employment of artillery and
mechanized units
Selection of the direction of the main attack also is influenced
by the time available for movement before the attack
must be launched In many situations the most rapid and
decisive results are to be expected when the main attack is
composed principally of large armored units or when such
units lead the main attack Air superiority and effective support
of the armored units by combat aviation are essential
to the sustained drive of the armored units
FORMS OF OFFENSIVE ACTION
â¢
46 Attack maneuvers are classified as envelopments and
penetrations
â¢ 462 In an envelopment the main attack is directed against
the flank or rear of the initial disposition of the enemy's
main forces and toward an objective in rear of his front
lines It seeks to surround that portion of the enemy's forces
in front of the objective It is assisted usually by a secondary
attack directed against the enemy's front
A successful envelopment depends largely on the ucgree
of surprise attained and on the ability of the secondary attack
to contain the bulk of the enemy's forces Surprise is secured
by maneuvering to avoid observation by the enemy and by
deceiving him Superior mobility increases the prospect of
success
An envelopment avoids attacking on ground chosen by the
enemy and forces him to fight in two or more directions to
meet the converging efforts of the attack An envelopment
which strikes the defender's flank or rear so as to avoid any
part of his organized front and small-arms fire from that
front is preferable It minimizes losses handicaps the defender's
ability to meet it promptly compels the defender to
meet an attack on ground chosen by the attacker and when
successful is more decisive
â¢ 463 A turning movement is an enveloping maneuver which
passes around the enemy's main forces striking at some vital
point deep in the hostile rear The force making the maneuver
usually operates so far from the secondary attack that the
99
463-465
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
principal tactical groupings are beyond mutual supporting
distance (the distance by which forces may be separated and
yet permit one to move to the aid of another before it can be
defeated by an enemy force) ; hence each grouping must be
strong enough or mobile enough to avoid defeat in detail
When conditions favor such action all combat elements of
the command may be employed in the turning force leaving
only reconnaissance elements confronting the hostile dispositions
The turning movement is adapted particularly to
highly mobile commands such as cavalry armored and motorized
forces and forces transported by aircraft It is invariably
employed by highly mobile forces in situations in
which the vital objective in the hostile rear can be seized by
such a maneuver before it is necessary to involve the enveloping
force in a major engagement with the enemy Deception
secrecy and mobility are vital to successful execution of a
turning movement
â¢ 464 When the enemy takes up a defensive position the
commander of the attacking forces should consider the possibility
of turning the enemy out of his position and forcing
him to withdraw and fight on ground more favorable to the
attacker
Situations may occur especially in the pursuit of a defeated
force in which the enemy can be forced by direct
attack to take up a defensive position while a portion of the
more mobile attacking forces executes a turning movement
against his lines of communication
â¢ 465 A double envelopment is executed by three principal
tactical groups two enveloping attack forces and a secondary
attack force A simultaneous envelopment of both flanks
generally requires considerable superiority
The command seeking to attack by double development
must be deployed or capable of deploying on a broad front
against an enemy on a much narrower front or with little
capability or room for maneuver The maneuver is executed
by fighting a holding battle with the center while enveloping
forces strike on both hostile flanks When mobile' forces are
available in reserve they may complete the envelopment by
an attack from the rear When conditions favor it this
form of maneuver should be used because of the decisive
results it promises
00
OPERATIONS
466-469
â¢ 466 An envelopment of one flank is executed by two principal
tactical groups the main or enveloping attack force
and the secondary attack force After an initial envelopment
of one flank favorable conditions for passing to a
double envelopment through the use of reserves may be created
when the success of our troops has placed the enemy in
a disadvantageous situation
â¢ 467 The enemy's preparations to meet an envelopment of
his flank ordinarily cannot be organized as completely as
the defense of his front especially if the envelopment is
launched from a locality deep on the hostile flank or rear
The defender strengthens an unsupported flank by reserves
echeloned in depth and in width When threatened
with envelopment he moves them to meet the maneuver He
may attempt to envelop the attacking forces or to extend
his flank beyond that of the attack up to the limit of his
strength An attempt on the part of the attacker to meet
such hostile extension may lead to overextension or to a dangerous
separation of the enveloping forces from those making
the secondary attack It usually is better to take advantage
of the enemy's extension and consequent weakness
by retaining a deep formation and to penetrate his thinly
held front than to overextend in an effort further to outflank
the position When the enemy extends his position
beyond the enveloping forces particular attention must be
paid to protecting the exterior flank by the use of the general
reserves of the higher commander
II 468 In a penetration the main attack passes through some
portion of the area occupied by the enemy's main forces and
is directed on an objective in his rear It is characterized
by the complete rupture of the enemy's dispositions ; the
seizure of the objective by operations through the gap ; and
the envelopment of one or both flanks created by the breakthrough
The essential conditions for success are surprise sufficient
fire power especially combat aviation and artillery to neutralize
the front of penetration favorable terrain within the
hostile position for the advance of the attacking troops and
strength to carry the attack through to its objective
0 469 When the situation does not favor an envelopment
the main attack is directed to penetrate the hostile front
0
469-47
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
Conditions which demand a penetration are enemy's flanks
unassailable ; lack of time to make an enveloping maneuver
Conditions which favor a penetration are overextension of
the enemy ; terrain and observation favorable for more effective
cooperation of the combined arms Such an attack often
can be organized more quickly than can an envelopment
! 470 In the penetration of a defensive position the main
attack is launched on a front wider than that of the contemplated
break-through in order to hold the enemy in place
on the flanks of the penetration The attack on the remainder
of the hostile front is designed to contain the enemy
and prevent him from moving his reserves
The amount of artillery mechanized units and supporting
combat aviation available largely determines the width of
the front of penetration The wider the front of penetration
the deeper can it be driven and the more difficult will it be
for the enemy to close the gap The deeper the penetration
the more effective will be the action of mobile reserves in
seizing the objective and rolling up the hostile flanks
The greatest distribution in depth is placed opposite the
prospective front of penetration The distribution of troops
provides for three separate impulses ; a break through the
hostile position a widening of the gap thus created by enveloping
one or both interior hostile flanks and the seizure of the
objective and exploitation of the success
The sequence of these impulses depends on the situation
In some situations it is practicable through the existence of
weaknesses or gaps in the enemy's front for mobile troops
(armored motorized or cavalry divisions) to break through
and to proceed straight to the objective while operations of
local envelopment and exploitation are performed by less
mobile troops In other situations foot troops must break
through the more mobile troops being held initially in reserve
and used later to operate through the gap created by
the foot troops
i 47 The mission of the attacking echelon of troops is to
break through the enemy's dispositions so that he will be
unable to reconstitute his front on a rearward line Until
this mission has been accomplished the attacking troops do
not divert their strength to the attack of the flanks of the
gap Hostile counterattacks against the flanks of the pene-
02
OPERATIONS
47 -474
tration are met by reserves by the fire of the artillery and
by combat aviation
The missions of rolling up the flanks of a gap created by
penetration and of exploiting the break-through are assigned
to reserves Cavalry armored and motorized units are especially
suitable for seizing the objective and for exploitation
These units are supported by combat aviation operating
against hostile reserves and artillery and other important
objectives Troops transported by air may be used to support
these operations
â 472 In large commands a penetration often is initiated by
launching simultaneously two or more powerful attacks (a
multiple penetration) against weak localities on the hostile
front Strong localities are contained initially by secondary
attacks When the penetrating attacks have advanced far
enough to permit the interior strong localities are reduced
by maneuver and the penetrating attacks are united into a
single main attack The pinching out of strong hostile localities
often is facilitated by launching multiple penetrations in
converging directions The doctrines applicable to a single
penetration govern the organization and conduct of a multiple
penetration
â 473 Whether the maneuver adopted is an envelopment or
a penetration success will depend primarily on intelligent
energetic and coordinated execution This execution must
be based on a sound plan which is influenced largely by the
objective and direction of the main attack
The doctrines which underlie the employment of the combined
arms in the offensive are conservation of the combat
power of troops in the attack echelon provision of assistance
for them to close with the enemy and thereafter support of
their attack until the enemy's power of resistance is broken
FRONTAGES AND DEPTHS
â 474 The frontage assigned to any unit in an attack varies
with the mobility type of armament mission and combat
power of the unit the terrain the amount of fire support
available and the probable hostile resistance As a general
guide an infantry battalion at full strength in a main attack
seldom is assigned a frontage less than 500 yards or more
than 000 yards measured on the front of the hostile position
03
475-480
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
0 475 Units are distributed in depth to provide flexibility of
maneuver continuity in the attack and security For infantry

echelon and targetswithin range on which artillery fire cannot be placed 502 The action of combat aviation in support of groundtroops is closely coordinated with the plan of attack Itsfirst objectives are those hostile elements the destruction orneutralization of which will contribute most toward a successful attack During battle combat aviation is especiallyuseful as a means immediately available to a commanderto exploit a success to correct an adverse situation to attackreserves or reinforcements or to support ground troops inovercoming unexpected resistance Its employment to complement the fire of artillery in a crisis or in fast moving situations is habituespecially in attacks by tanks and armoredforces 503 To assure effective cooperation supporting combataviation should operate from landing fields within shortflying time of the zone of action and must be included in theair-ground radio net and wire net of supported units Tofacilitate coordination of its effort with that of the groundtroops a liaison officer from supporting combat aviationshould be with the supported unit Supported ground troopsmust keep supporting combat aviation informed of the location of leading elements and of plans of maneuver and fireIt is especially important that adequate means of identification of friendly ground troops be carefully arranged andcoordinated 504 An integration of the attack into a unified whole requires complete coordination and cooperation prior to andduring the operation between supporting tanks artilleryand combat aviation (See chs 2 and 6 )H 505 Because of the difficulty of establishing and maintaining effective chemical concentrations in mobile operationsuse by the attacker of chemical agents other than smoke islimitedSmoke must be carefully employed in respect toboth

especially useful during shortt periods whentroops must cross exposed ground506 As soon' as the commander has made his decision hecompletes his plan of attack and issues his attack orderwherein he prescribes the necessary coordination for theaction(See FM 0 -5 )507 When conditions limit the ability of the commander toexercise a timely and direct influence on the action the initiative of subordinates must be relied upon to a great extentThe commander issues less detailed orders to those tacticalgroupings over whose action he can not exercise a direct influence and attaches to them the means necessary to accomplish their tasks He remains with and personally directsthe action of the troops whose mission is of decisive importance to the action This method of conducting an operationis most prevalent in pursuits in opening phases of a meetingengagement during crises of battle and in envelopments inwhich the main and secondary attacks are separated by wideintervalsThe greatest degree of coordination possible isprescribed initially , complete coordination is accomplished(See par 25 )as soon as the course of action permitsf visits0 508 Coordination is assured by command and stafto subordinates to see that orders are understood and are beingcarried outSECTION IIATTACK IN WAR OF MOVEMENT509 A meeting engagement is a collision between two opposing forces more or less unprepared for battle Ordinarilythe collision is caused by uncertainty or obscurity in the situationThis aspect is often present in the operations ofsmall units and in situations where the means of reconnaissance have failed or are unable to operateA meeting engagement may ensue when each opponent iscognizant of the other, yet both decide to attack withoutdelay to retain some tactical advantage to gain a decisiveterrain feature or from a feeling of superiority It mayoccur when one opponent decides to deploy hastily for defense while the other attacks' before this defense can beorganized2OPERATIONS5 0-5 45 0 In open warfare immediate orders and rapid actionaxe essential By the prompt exercise of initiative endeavormust be made to deprive the enemy of his freedom of actionand prevent the coordinated employment of his forcesAgreat advantage accrues to the force which first succeeds inmaking effective preparationsAction cannot be delayedawaiting the results of detailed reconnaissances Prompt estimate of the situation quick decision and prompt attack areessential to successThe tactical situation which develops on first contact has astrong influence on the subsequent course of action Commanders must be well forward when the enemy is engaged ,otherwise units may be employed improperlyOpportunities for decisive action must be exploited immediatelyThe rapidity of modern combat frequently makesthe time element decisive8 5Open warfare requires the widest possible exercise ofinitiative by commanders of all echelons in the execution ofthe general mission assigned to the commandInformation gained by reconnaissance agencies during theadvance affords a basis for the commander's preliminary disposition and may enable him to determine the general lineof engagement with the enemy and the plan of attack Asa rule however the enemy's intentions will remain obscureand will seldom be clarified until after the initial engagement 5 2 As soon as the prospect of an engagement becomesapparent the superior commander initiates plans for theoperation and disposes his command to facilitate its rapidentry into action One or more advance message centers areestablished to facilitate prompt signal communicationEarly and rapid transmission of orders to elements of themain body is essential to an orderly and timely employmentof the command and may be vital particularly in columns ofhigh mobility 5 3 Initial orders are ordinarily issued in fragmentaryform to the various elements of the command The sequencein which orders are issued is based upon the priority of andthe time required for execution 5 4 When timely information of the enemy is lackingsubordinate commanders are relied upon to exercise theirinitiative and make important decisions in consonance with3,,OPERATIONS5 4-5 75 7-520FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONSthe general mission and the intentions of the superior commander Without delay the superior commander coordinates the action which his subordinates have initiated(Seepar 507 ) 5 5 Employment of the advance guard is the commander'sfirst problem and is the basis for the employment of theremainder of the main body When contact is imminent orwhen entering the zone of effective hostile artillery fire theadvance guard moves forward on a broad front When hostile resistance is encountered the advance guard must securepossession of terrain that will afford good observation forthe artillery and other supporting weapons and gain thetime and space required for the development and deploymentof the main body These missions require aggressive actionagainst the enemy's leading troops Unfavorable terrain oran encounter with superior hostile forces may make a temporary defense or a limited retirement advisable to preservethe commander's freedom of action However all advanceguard actions are characterized by speed and aggressivenessby broad fronts and by small or no reservesThe advance guard performs its mission most effectivelywhen after securing possession of the essential terrain featuresit is disposed to protect the deployment of the main body Itsartillery deploys on a broad front opens long-range fire onenemy columns forcing them to an early deployment andinterdicts the principal routes of approachThe advance guard is strongly reinforced by artillery fromthe main body and by supporting combat aviationIt isreinforced with other elements of the main body only whenthe situation clearly demands it5 6 Cavalry after withdrawal from the front of advanceguard infantry may be employed on the flanks to screen ourown dispositions to execute reconnaissance or harassingaction against the hostile flanks and rear or may be heldin reserve5 7 The speed of modern offensive operations demandsthat supporting artillery be prepared to react immediatelywith fire when opportune targets are presented To do thisartillery observation and positions must be as far forwardas possibleEarly entry into action of the bulk of the artillery with themain body is essential to protect the development to givesupport and cohesion to the advance-guard action and togain an early superiority over the hostile artilleryIt may be necessary for a portion of the artillery to occupytemporary firing positions to Insure that troops do not comeunder hostile fire without artillery protection 5 8 The artillery preferably is deployed initially so thatit can protect the development and support the attack fromthe same position areas 'When initial positions are too distant the artillery in direct support must so displace forwardas to assure close support of the attack echelonWhile other troops are organizing their attack the artillery completes preparation of firing data and arrangementsfor supporting the attack Observation aviation is placedat the disposal of the artillery commander in order thatthe hostile artillery and large troop assemblies may be located and fire conducted on important targets at long range 5 9 In accordance with his estimate of the situation thecommander develops the main body and organizes a coordinated attack or attacks directly from march columnswith a part of his command and organizes a more coordinatedattack with the remainder or attacks with his whole forcefrom march columns as units become available(See pars485-487 492 and 507 ) 520 Regardless of whether the attack is launched fromassembly positions or directly from march columns themethod of approach to the hostile position is the sameEach battalion of the attack echelon moves to the most advanced position In which it can make its final preparationsunder cover from hostile small-arms fireThe commander of each attack unit directs its advancein the assigned zone of action so as to be able to cross theline of

It involvesa thorough study of the map and airphotographs of the enemy's combat zone and the use ofavailable air and ground reconnaissance agencies523 If air reconnaissance and advance detachments fail toestablish definitely the main hostile position the leadingtroops are reinforced strongly by artillery combat aviationother supporting weapons and if necessary by tanks Riflereinforcements are held to a minimum The reinforced leading troops execute a reconnaissance in force against criticalpoints in the enemy's outpost zone to drive in the enemy'scovering forces and determine the hostile main positionTheir mission is to seize the terrain which will permit theproper deployment of the command and permit observationof the hostile battle positionWhen the leading troops finally encounter a

M37 added another vehicle to the combat
team built upon the Light Tank M24
chassis and continued the line of powerful
weapons started with 105-mm Howitzer
Motor Carriage M7, which helped rout
Rommel in Libya.
All are lightly-armored, open-top
vehicles in which a 105-mm howitzer is
the pri1 armament. The pulpitlike
appearance of the machine gun compartment
caused the M7 to be nicknamed
""The Priest"" by British troops .
105-MM HOWITZER MOTOR CARRIAGE
M7 was standardized in April
1942 and was reclassified as Substitute
Standard in January 1945 . The vehicle is
based on a Medium Tank M3 chassis
which has a Continental R-975-01 gasoline
engine, syncromesh transmission, and
a vertical volute spring suspension.
Principal armament is a 105-mm Howitzer
M2A1 mounted at the front of the
crew compartment . The howitzer can be
elevated from -5Â° to +35Â° and can be
traversed 30Â° to the right and 15 Â° to the
left. An HE shell, fired from this howitzer,
has a muzzle velocity of 1,550 feet per
second at an elevation of 44 Â° and a
maximum range of 12,205 yards .
A Cal. .50 Machine Gun M2 HB (flexible)
on a ring mount is provided for use
against low-flying aircraft . Provision is
made for 3 cal . .45 submachine guns .
The crew of seven consists of the driver,
chief of section, gunner, and four cannoneers
. The crew compartment is protected
by i2-in. armor at the front, sides,
and rear, and is open at the top . The
upper portion of the side and rear armor
is hinged and held in position by lock
pins. Grip handles, which serve as ladders
leading to the crew compartment, are
at both sides of the vehicle .
Direct vision for the driver is through a
removable windshield and indirect vision
through a protectoscope . The vehicle has
five speeds forward and one reverse, the
maximum speed being 24 m .p .h .

and less expensive 105-mm howitzer
motor carriage than the earlier vehicles,
which were based on medium tank chassis,
and has better armor protection .
It is a full track-laying vehicle, with
individual torsion bar suspension, driven
from the front sprocket. Like the Twin
40-mm Gun Motor Carriage M19, it has
a chassis similar to the Light Tank M24,
forming another member of a combat
team of vehicles designed for maximum
interchangeability .

HALF-TRACK CARS M2, M2A1-LIMITED STANDARD
HALF-TRACK PERSONNEL CARRIERS M3, M3A1 LIMITED STANDARD
HALF-TRACK CAR M3AZ STANDARD
Half-Track Car M2 and Half-Track Personnel Carrier M3, the
basic half-track vehicles, were standardized in 1940 and
used throughout 1941 and 1942 . With the addition of ring
mounts for antiaircraft use and with other modifications, their
designations were changed to M2A1 and M3A1 respectively .
All of these vehicles are now classified as Limited Standard and
will be replaced in production by Half-Track Car M3A2.
Consisting, of a specially designed, commercial-type, frontand-
rear drive truck chassis with an armored hull, the halftrack
vehicle can attain a maximum road 'speed of 40 m .p .h .
Because of its endless-band track-laying rear drive, however,
it can be used over rough terrain . It will cross ditches which are
not sufficiently deep to cause the front or rear to become embedded
. Some models are provided with a roller at the front
to assist in climbing out of ditches . On other models, the roller
is replaced by a winch for use in towing the vehicle out of soft
terrain .
The body is protected by Y4-in . armor at the sides and rear.
Top and side protection is given the engine by the armored
hood. The radiator is protected by armored shutters which can

be opened or closed or set in three intermediate positions from
within the driver's compartment . The windshield is of shatterproof
glass .
For further protection, a Y2-in . armored shield is hinged
above the windshield frame, held open by three supports, and
additional armored shields are hinged to the doors . In combat
zones, the windshield can be removed and these shields swung
into place . They are provided with direct-vision slots .
The detachable top is of canvas and is supported by three
removable bows and the windshield frame . Removable side
curtains with transparent windows also are provided. Mine
racks are mounted on the sides of late production models .
Power is supplied by a White 160AX gasoline engine .
HALF-TRACK CAR M2-LIMITED STANDARD, has seats for
a crew of ten . A skate rail surrounds the interior of the vehicle .
By the use of two carriage mounts, a cal . .30 and a cal . .50
machine gun can be moved along this rail and fired in any
direction .
This vehicle can be used as a prime mover for the 105-mm
howitzer.

to the M2 but has an M49 ring mount for cal . .50 machine gun
over the assistant driver's seat . By use of this mount the cal .
.50 1113 machine gun can be traversed 360 Â° from a single position,
permitting rapid fire against low-flying aircraft as well as
against ground targets . It can be elevated from -15 Â° to +85Â° .
Three fixed pintle sockets are mounted, one on each side
and one on the rear of the body, permitting the use of a cal .
.30 machine gun .
HALF-TRACK PERSONNEL CARRIER M3-LIMITED STANDARD,,
is generally similar to the M2 but has seating accommodations
for 13 men . The body is about 10 inches longer than
on the M2 and has a door at the rear. Instead of a skate rail,
the vehicle has an M25 pedestal mount for a cal . .30 machine
gun, which is secured to the floor of the, personnel compartment .

HALF-TRACK PERSONNEL CARRIER M3A1-LIMITED
STANDARD, is similar to the M3 but has an M49 ring mount
for a cal . .50 machine gun over the assistant driver's seat .
Three pintle sockets are mounted, one on each side and one
on the rear of the body .
HALF-TRACK CAR M3A2-STANDARD, is a modification
of the Half-Track Personnel Carrier M3A1 designed to take
the place of Half-Track Personnel Carriers M3 and M3A1, and
Half-Track Cars M2 and M2A1 .
Variations in stowage arrangements, through the use of suit
able boxes, give the vehicle a variety of uses . Crews range fron
5 to 12 men, depending on the amount of stowage carried ant
the tactical purpose intended .
Normally the vehicle mounts one cal . .50 machine gun o
one cal. .30 machine gun, together with the required vehicula
accessories, tools, spare parts, and equipment which are provide
for all half-tracks . Under such circumstances, a crew of 12 ca
be carried . Three pintle sockets are provided to accommodat
additional machine guns when authorized.
When the vehicles carry special loadings or have radic
installed, personnel are displaced . As an example, if an SCR-50
radio is installed, the crew is reduced by two men .
The basic vehicle is equipped to stow and carry 330 rounc
of cal . .50 ammunition and 2,000 rounds of cal . .30 ammunitiol
When used as a machine gun squad carrier, however, addition,
ammunition is carried in place of two of the seat position
When used by a heavy machine gun squad armed with wate
cooled machine guns, these guns and their accessories are sul
stituted for the air-cooled cal . .30 machine gun .

Command headquarters in England, where he had gone to finalize the
arrangements made the previous evening. Simonds was present at Army
headquarters and took the opportunity to discuss the expected air support.
Despite the previous days contingency planning, it now seemed
that the thinning out of the forward line was not an indication of an
impending general withdrawal. Simonds told Mann that the enemy
showed every intention to hold his positions opposite 2 Cdn Corps [sic]
front, and reiterated the importance of the second-phase bombing.
Simondss later memo to Crerar reasoned that the thickening up of the
second line meant that 2nd Corps would likely meet stronger resistance
than originally anticipated, but because the air plan had, in any case,
been formulated to assist a second break-through operation, no
change in the air plan was required.64
That plan was, for the most part, finalized in two documents issued
by AEAF on 6 August and 2nd Corps in the early morning of the seventh.
Both documents reflect the decisions taken at the conference of 5
August, though there are some interesting discrepancies in the way the
army and the air force each articulated the purpose and the procedures
of the air strikes. The AEAF plan made no distinction between the purposes
of the bombing in Phases I and II. In both, it was to [d]estroy
enemy installations and forces in the target areas. Cratering was
acceptable in all first-phase areas, and desired in all second-phase
areas except target 8. H-hour for Phase II would not be earlier than
1400 hours 8 August.65 Simondss headquarters, meanwhile, specified
that [c]ratering has been accepted in the initial attack on 7 August,
with a view to isolating the corridor through which the armour and
infantry are to advance. Contrary to what the AEAF planned for targets
6 through 9, [c]ratering has NOT been accepted in these areas.66 The
latter attack, furthermore, was to be made at 1300 hours. The cause of
confusion over the timing was a difference in usage of the term H-hour.
The army referred to H-hour as the time at which leading troops would
cross the startline for the attack, while the air force used the term to

indicate the time that the first bomb was to be dropped.67 These inconsistencies
indicate a continuing confusion in communications between
the army and air force. In spite of all the meetings and memos, the two
did not think of the tactical support problem in the same terms.
As it turned out, Bomber Command would not be responsible if cratering
occurred in the wrong target areas. At some point between 1100
and 1535 hours on 7 August, it was decided that Eighth Air Force would
make the Phase II attacks after all, and would hit the targets on the
flanks where cratering was acceptable as well as those in the centre
where it was not. A final conference to confirm the arrangements for the
operation was held that morning, attended by representatives from First
Canadian Army, 21st Army Group, 83 Group, and 84 Group. It confirmed
H-hour on 8 August as 1400, subject to change by 2nd Corps
upon five hours advance notice to Bomber Command.68 Then at 1535
hours, First Canadian Army received word through 21st Army Group
that H-hour on the following day was 1300, but the bombing of the flank
targets (6 and 7) would PROBABLY COMMENCE BEFORE H HOUR. The
remaining targets would be hit at H-hour, and all bombing was to be completed
by H plus forty-five minutes. The reason for bombing earlier on 8
August was a meteorological forecast predicting that after 1300 hours
the weather would be unsuitable. If this late change regarding timings
caused Simonds and his staff to scramble, it has been recorded nowhere.
The message concluded that detailed arrangements would be completed
by First Canadian Army and Eighth Air Force, through 83
Group.69 An RAF draft narrative explains the reason for the latter
change:
The settled fair weather was marked by an absence of wind
which resulted in persistent morning fogs. This entailed the
risk of R.A.F. Bomber Commands forces having to land away
from their bases after a night operation and thus it would be
impossible to guarantee a sufficiently strong force for the second
phase of the bombing operations on the following day.70
More major alterations, this time to the air plan rather than the ground
plan, were thus being made virtually at the last minute. The change in
timings and air forces would have unfortunate consequences the next
day.

MILITARY HISTORY ? 161
While the final arrangements for the air support were being made,
German dispositions were again changing. There was considerable
uncertainty as to the status of the SS divisions during the two days
immediately preceding the start of Operation Totalize. By the early
morning hours of 7 August, Army Intelligence had confirmed the relief
of 1st SS, but speculated that it may have left behind some tanks to bolster
the defence by a weak infantry division. The two divisions were still
believed to constitute part of a counterattack reserve on the Caen front,
with one or two independent battalions of Tiger tanks possibly providing
additional support. The summary for 6 August stated that during the
entire campaign any significant reserves collected had always been sent
to plug holes in the German line, and an unstable flank now existed
south of Vire as a result of the Cobra breakout, so there could be no certainty
as to how the enemy would use his reserve.71
Corps Intelligence, meanwhile, reported the westward shift of considerable
portions of both divisions to meet the threat across the
ORNE posed by Second Armys bridgehead to the north of Thury-Harcourt.
Although Canadian Intelligence did not realise it, the Hitlerjugend
had in fact been split into three battle groups, two of which had been
sent to check Second Army in the Vire and Grimbosq areas while the
third alone remained on the Canadian front just south of Bretteville-surLaize.72
Large elements of 1st SS had also been identified further west
near the town of Vassy, about fourteen miles west of Falaise.73
The picture cleared somewhat at 1320 hours on the seventh with an
appreciation of enemy strength and dispositions produced by Lieutenant-Colonel
P. E. R. Wright, Crerars chief intelligence officer, which
considered the probable German reaction to Totalize. He did not expect
89th Division to be capable of strong resistance if subjected to extraordinary
bombardment or its positions were penetrated. Though still convinced
that 12th SS was in the Mézidon-Valmeray area to the east,
Wright reported that elements were known to be as far west as Bretteville-sur-Laize.
The division was assumed to have about eighty tanks,
including thirty-five Panthers. The only other troops in the area were
probably some [tanks] of 1 SS Pz Regt which may have been left, either
to give additional [strength] to the [forward defensive] line or to provide
an [armoured reserve], and twenty-five Tiger tanks of the 101st Heavy
Tank Battalion. In fact, 12th SS had available only about thirty-nine of
its own Panzer IVs and the eight or so Tigers of the 101st with which to

meet the Canadian assault on the morning of 8 August.74 Wright recognised
that the Germans did not have adequate strength to stabilise the
situation on their western flank, and [f]or that reason 1 SS Pz Div may
be assumed to have gone there [south of Vire] and its place taken by 12
SS Pz Div with responsibility extended over a wider area. Wright evaluated
the reserve12th SSas insufficient either to maintain the front
line or to stabilise the second. This judgment would prove the only significant
error in the appreciation.75
Although Wright underestimated the abilities of 89th and 12th SS
Divisions, the importance of the appreciation lay in the provision for
Simonds of a fairly accurate description of the forces that he could expect
to oppose the advance of 2nd Corps. By 0100 hours on the eighth, Army
Intelligence had further learned that several elements of 1st SS, including
artillery, had been identified in the Mortain area. While it could not
be assumed that the entire division had left, most of it was out of the way
except for parties likely to be left to give strength and encouragement to
89th Division. That left only 12 SS known to be in the area.76
The Leibstandarte was no longer on the Caen front, as Wright had
surmised. It had been gone for about twenty-four hours by the time his
appreciation was prepared. The relief of 1st SS had been effected in
order to free it up to take part in Operation Lüttich, Hitlers desperate
counterattack against the American breakout on the western flank near
the town of Mortain. The attack began shortly after midnight 6/7 August,
and was quickly contained by the Americans.77 By the time this information
filtered through to Montgomery, Crerar, and Simonds, the
impending Canadian operation had taken on immensely greater importance.
The transfer west of the German reserve weakened the enemys
defences on the Canadian front, and Second Armys gains along the Orne
threatened the flank and rear of the German positions opposite First
Canadian Army. When Lüttich was stopped and General George S. Pattons
Third U.S. Army continued to sweep around the German forces to
the south and east, the famous Falaise Pocket was formed, in which
the remnants of the German Seventh Army were trapped. Panzer Group
Westnow renamed Fifth Panzer Armyat the eastern, open end of the
pocket also faced envelopment if the Canadians could close the gap by
taking Falaise and blocking the roads leading out of the pocket to the
east. The Germans had made a huge strategic gamble by committing the
bulk of their available reserve at Mortain, and Montgomery was now pre74.

sented with the opportunity to bag all of the German forces in Normandy
if the envelopment could be completed by a thrust to Falaise.
At 2300 hours on 7 August, Bomber Command executed the first
ever tactical support mission by heavy bombers at night. Five minutes
earlier, the twenty-five-pounder field guns of 2nd Canadian Infantry Division
began firing green flare shells on May-sur-Orne and Fontenay-leMarmion.
East of the Falaise road, 51st Highlands divisional artillery
fired red flares on La Hogue, Secqueville-la-Campagne, and the wood to
the immediate south of the latter town. Mosquito Pathfinders led the
bomber stream to the target areas, where 1,019 Lancasters and Halifaxes
began to drop 3,460 tons of high explosive.78 The weather was relatively
clear, but a lack of wind meant that the smoke and dust from the explosions
dispersed slowly. The target markers thus became obscured and,
consequently, only 641 aircraft bombed their targets. Despite some
claims exaggerating the positive effects of the air strike, 21st Army
Groups No. 2 Operational Research Section later reported that the
bombing was inaccurate and hit relatively little of importance.79
The artillery, meanwhile, opened up with a thunderous roar at 2343
hours, lending further support to the men of 2nd Canadian Corps. Once
the bombing was completed, 2nd Divisions twenty-five-pounders fired
green flare shells onto Point 122, the high ground near Cramesnil, to
mark the interdivisional boundary. Radio beams, searchlights providing
artificial moonlight, and Bofors antiaircraft guns firing tracer bullets
were used to maintain direction during the night attack.80 The assault
forces had been marshalled into seven armoured columns, each with its
own objective, astride the Caen-Falaise road. A gapping force composed
of tanks of the Sherbrooke Fusiliers and an assortment of navigational
tanks, engineers bulldozers, and mine-clearing Crabs mounting
large flails led the way. Following close behind was a fortress force of
three squadrons of the Fort Garry Horse that would secure the infantrys
dispersal area. At that point the columns would separate and the assault
forces, made up of carrier-borne battalions of 4th Canadian Infantry
Brigade, would take the first-phase objectives. Self-propelled guns of the

6th Antitank Regiment accompanied the columns to support the attackers
on the objectives while the infantrys own six-pounders were brought
forward. The battalions of 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade were to follow
behind on foot to mop up the areas bypassed by the armoured columns.
Similar tasks were assigned to 33rd British Armoured Brigade and 51st
Highland Division east of the road.81
The four columns on the Canadian side of the road had formed up
near the town of Ifs, just southwest of Caen, during the afternoon of 7
August. They crossed the startline at 2330 hours. The difficulty of keeping
direction in the dark during the Gallop to the dispersal areas was
aggravated by the great dust clouds raised by the bombing and the mass
of moving vehicles. The Germans added smoke shells to the dust. Visibility
was reduced to zero, and some of the tanks collided with or fired
on other Allied vehicles. Near Rocquancourt the three right-hand
columns lost their course, and the confusion was increased when a German
88-mm gun opened fire, causing heavy casualties to the vehicles of
the Essex Scottish on the right flank. In the centre, the Royal Hamilton
Light Infantry (RHLI) managed to sort itself out and was approaching its
objective by 0400 hours. By 0800 hours the battalion had dug in just
north of a quarry where the Germans were established with supporting
armour, and assisted by the Sherbrooke tanks, repelled a counterattack
from between eight and ten SP guns and [tanks] with some [infantry].
The RHLI spent most of the day consolidating its position, and not until
1800 hours did a patrol report the objective clear of the enemy.82 The
Royal Regiment of Canada took its objective near Gaumesnil, and was
then also occupied in fighting off German counterattacks. The 8th
Reconnaissance Regiment, meanwhile, was initially stopped short of
Point 122 on the left, the anchor of the first German line, but the high
ground was subsequently taken with help from some Fort Garry tanks.
The 8th Recce and a squadron of Sherbrooke tanks then moved to assist
the Essex Scottish, which had come up short of Caillouet. That town was
captured around noon.83 Brigadier Wyman of 2nd Canadian Armoured
Brigade had signalled at 0615 hours that the [objective] area was
securely held by our forces and that the situation appeared to be entirely
suitable for further ops to begin.84

Wymans report was premature, but the columns had nevertheless
succeeded in penetrating the German lines and were nearing the objectives
of the first phase by early morning. East of the road, 51st Highland
and 33rd British Armoured Brigade were having a similar time. After
some initial delay due to enemy fire, the right-hand column took
Cramesnil by early morning. On the left, St. Aignan de Cramesnil and
the wood to the south were captured with light casualties.85 The assault
had thoroughly disorganized the 89th Division and broken the forward
German line. Some historians have strongly argued that the way was
clear on both sides of the Falaise road for the second phase to begin.86
The formation that was to lead the way for 4th Armoured Division
was far from ready, however. The assignment had been given to
Halpenny Force, a battle group composed of the Canadian Grenadier
Guards tanks and infantry of the Lake Superior Regiment. The spearhead
of the force was 1 Squadron of the Guards, led by Major E. A. C.
Amy. It had been ordered forward from its concentration area just south
of Caen, beginning at 0030 hours, to the forming-up place (FUP) recently
vacated by the armoured columns that made the Phase I attack. From
there it would be marshalled for the advance to its startline for Phase II,
near the road running from Bretteville-sur-Laize to St. Aignan. An
account given by Amy recalled the chaos that dominated an orders
group preceeding the move forward, in which the noise from the aircraft
overhead and nearby artillery drowned out Lieutenant-Colonel W. W.
Halpenny of the Guards, and the lights had been doused so as not to
arouse the interest of the bombers. The move to the marshalling area
was further complicated by unfamiliarity with the ground and a lack of
adequate time to brief tank crews. This, in turn, led to much confusion
over timings for Phase 2. Our CO told me, 1 Sqn, to be ready to cross the
start line at first light (approx 0500 hrs) depending upon the success of
Phase 1.87 The disarray within Halpenny Force only added to the inherent
difficulties of coordinating such a complex operation.
Amys advance to the startline was delayed by the ongoing battle in
the forward areas bypassed by the armoured columns. Although the Germans
forward positions had been penetrated and 89th Division thoroughly
disorganized by the stunning success of Phase I, the defenders
continued to fight in scattered groups and held on to key towns anchoring
the line. Amy was subsequently told we were not to proceed to our
start line until 2 Div declared Roquancourt [sic] clear which we under85.

stood would be soon.88 Although the South Saskatchewan Regiment had
entered the town at 0045 hours, the area had not yet been made secure
enough to permit an orderly advance by 4th Division.89 Not until 1224
hours did 4th Armoured Brigade report ROCQUANCOURT now clear
and tell the tanks to get cracking.90 The helter-skelter move to the
startline continued. Elsewhere, repeated attacks by 51st Highland had
been necessary to capture Tilly-la-Campagne, which did not fall until
0700 hours. The Queens Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada fighting
for Fontenay, meanwhile, were in trouble. Under heavy shellfire, the battalion
was unable to clear the southern part of the village and had had
its main axis [to its rear] cut. Battalion HQ was hit, and for the second
time in twelve hours the battalion lost its commanding officer.91 Fontenay
was not cleared until the afternoon, after the South Saskatchewan
Regiment and a squadron of 1st Hussars tanks fought their way across
Verrières Ridge and linked up with the Camerons. May had been equally
difficult and costly to capture. The Fusiliers Mont-Royal had been subjected
to heavy fire and required the assistance of Crocodiles,
Churchill tanks fitted with flamethrowers, before succeeding around
1600 hours.92
While 2nd Corps did not have to deal with the armoured counterattacks
from the areas around May, Fontenay, and Secqueville that
Simonds had expected when 1st SS held the frontand for which he had
planned the first-phase bomber strikes89th Division had not disintegrated
as soon as H-hour arrived on 7 August. A new front line had
resulted from the successful armoured advance, but throughout the
eighth stubborn resistance and counterattacks had to be overcome all
over the Totalize battlefield, in May, Fontenay, Rocquancourt, St. Aignan,
and at Point 122 and the quarry confronting the RHLI. It was
through the midst of the ongoing struggle that the 4th Canadian and Polish
Armoured Divisions had to travel just to reach the startlines for their
own attacks. The inclusion of the Poles in the second phase also meant
that an additional division would have to move up through an area
already crowded with Canadian infantry, artillery, armour, and other services
and supplies.
Both divisions were slow in moving forward because their lines of
approach were under enemy fire. Maczek claimed that continuing opposition
on 51st Highlands objectives required his division to assist in

mopping-up before it could proceed with its own tasks.93 With the Poles
consequent delay in moving up, Amys spearhead faced an open left flank
during its move forward and a decided lack of knowledge about enemy
dispositions. Adding to his discomfort, the leading tanks were being
shelled. The advance was, understandably, cautious. Far from being
ready at the startline by 0500 hours, Amy was again told to get cracking
. . . ignore shelling at 1230 by an impatient 4th Armoured Brigade.94
Amys fire support was not ready either. Three field regiments, after ceasing
fire in the early hours of the eighth in order to move the guns up in
support of the second-phase advance, found their potential positions
being systematically shelled from three sides and under mortar fire from

still going on in their prospective areas.95 Behind the frontline, additional
units continued to move into the area. Traffic jams were inevitable
and added to the delays in moving forward.
Meanwhile, the rumble of four-engine bombers again filled the air
south of Caen. The Flying Fortresses of Eighth Air Force made their runs
against the second German line between 1226 and 1355 hours. Flak disrupted
the bomber formations on the run-in to the targets, and the
Mighty Eighth claimed that neither the target marker shells nor the
flares dropped by pathfinders were visible from the air. As a result, accuracy
was poor and the lack of wind allowed smoke and dust to obscure
the targets, making the problem worse. Only 497 Fortresses bombed,
and of the 55 tactical groups that made the attack, no more than 16
. . . bombed in or adjacent to the target areas.96
The attack seems to have accomplished littleGouvix was not
bombed at alland Kitching judged that it had not been as effective as
we had hoped, causing very few casualties amongst the Germans.97 Two
or three of the twelve-plane groups bombed First Canadian Army positions
just south of Caen, however, and the effect on the soldiers in the
packed rear areas was disastrous. Allied casualties totalled over three
hundred, including sixty-five killed. The 7th Medium Regiment, Royal
Canadian Artillery, was firing on the Germans when it was bombed near
Cormelles. The gunners lost eleven killed and eighteen wounded when
three of their guns suffered direct hits, and the adjacent ammunition

dump exploded.98 Also hit nearby was the 4th Medium Regiment, which
had moved to an assembly area in Vaucelles preparatory to taking up
new gun positions at Hubert Folie in support of the Polish Armoured
Division. Aside from devastating the supporting medium artillery regiments,
the bombing inflicted casualties on the Fort Garry Horse, Régiment
de la Chaudière, 1st Hussars, the Polish Armoured Division, the
headquarters of both 3rd Division and 2nd Armoured Brigade, and the
9th British Army Group Royal Artillery.99
By 1330 hours reports of the bombing were coming in to 2nd Corps
Headquarters. A message had to be passed through the First Canadian
Army-83 Group control centre before Eighth Air Force could be contacted
to stop the bombing. Without a direct link to the planes in the air,
nothing could be done in time. The fragmentation bombs had devastating
effects because, as Kitching later explained, several thousand vehicles,
guns and tanks and some 50,000 soldiers had moved into an area
approx 2 miles by 4 miles. The troops, caught in the open, presented
extremely vulnerable targets to the errant bombs.100 At 1700 hours,
Simonds spoke to Mann from his command post and delivered an optimistic
and undoubtedly erroneous evaluation of the bombing errors. He
said that his corpss fighting efficiency has NOT been affected by inaccurate
bombing by 8 USAAF. . . . One [ammunition] dump destroyed but
is being replaced. . . . [E]verything is in hand.101 On the contrary, it
must be re-emphasised that the operational plan depended on the availability
of overwhelming fire support. The Phase II bombing attack failed
to blast a path through the Germans secondary line, and the short drop
had taken a serious toll on the artillery units that were tasked to support
the armoured divisions assaulting that line. The mishap thus deprived
2nd Corps of crucial organic fire support, the absence of which may help
explain the slow progress made throughout the remainder of the day.
While the short drop was perhaps not decisive, it certainly marks the
symbolic turning point in the operation, after which little went right. Following
the first-phase breakthrough, Oberführer Kurt Meyer, commanding
the Hitlerjugend, redistributed his battle groups to stem the
Canadian assault. He ordered a counterattack by Kampfgruppe Waldmuller,
composed of infantry and 39 Mark IV tanks, which stopped the
Polish advance cold south of St. Aignan, while the lead troops of 4th
Canadian Armoured Division were brought to a halt north of Langannerie
by mines, enemy tanks, and antitank guns.102 A breakthrough of a

the forces objective was Point 195, on the other side of the Caen-Falaise

from reinforcements, and it was annihilated in a day-long siege.103 Point

When you are up in a place and not
firing and the enemy are dug in, unless you
can find something definite to shoot at, and
you are sure you can hit it, hold your fire .
It does nothing"" but draw enemy fire on you
and will draw mortar fire . Men are hard to
keep quiet and hard to make stay down in
places like that. I think the best place to
work is on the enemy flanks or in behind the
enemy. We traveled fifty miles behind the
enemy lines one time and they never got us .
This was at Kasserine Pass.
The enemy will shoot at anything that
moves and he will shoot anything that he has
got at it . He does a lot of wild firing.
We haven't had many replacements, two
or three in our platoon.
We eat "" "" rations and they are pretty
good. We don't cook them, but eat them
cold. Get along pretty well on that .
OLONEL STA K: "" "" ration cans open
below the top. This makes a very messy
dribble and gets the men dirtier than necessary
.

SERGEANT KEITH : We don't use our mess
kits except when we are back from the front .
Most of the men use the lemon juice in their
water because it seems to make it last longer .
We get a canteen a day and it isn't too much,
but we get along on it.
When you are moving men they are dependent
on the noncommissioned officer or
leader as to how to move forward. Sooner
or later they will lose contact with the noncommissioned
officer, as he has to stay at the
head. You should have a second-in-command .
It is a good thing to have the individual man
keep in contact with the man in front of him .
The new men don't know many of the men
in the company and get lost into some other
platoon or company. If you have a good
second-in-command he can keep them together.
The men follow better than trying
to send a man up by himself .
OLONEL STA K: That is why our losses
are so high in noncommissioned officers and
officers.
SERGEANT KEITH: There is another thing,
sir, we have men in our company that don't
know how to shoot rifles, and that is pretty

SERGEANT WILLIAM T. ETRITGE, ompany
""I"", 6th Armored Infantry, Maknassy, 5 April
1943.
Three main things that I think are important
: the first is to keep your weapons
clean-they won't fire if you don't . Stay under
cover. I have had men who . were not under
cover and they haven't come back. Then
get all the fire on the enemy that you can.
Our company has been longer in this battle
than any other company, from the 15th of
February to the 3rd of April. My men were
jumpy then but they are better now. We
get plenty to eat and get a canteen of water
a day.
INTER VIEW S
The enemy has a good machine gun, but
if you can get through you have got him . You
can get away from his artillery and his mortars
.
Three days ago we were going to attack,
we were going towards the hill . I put scouts
out in front. The enemy let my scouts get
within 20 to 25 yards of them and, I guess
thinking we were all there, put mortar fire
behind us and opened up with machine gun
fire ahead . They got my two scouts . The
scouts had got close enough so that they
couldn't be hit by mortar or machine gun,
but it looked as if they were hand grenaded .
The grenades set the grass on fire under the
scouts and when one got up to put the fire
out, they got him . We seen we could not
get past the machine gun so we were ordered
to withdraw.
I would say the enemy's best shots use
telescopic sights . Nobody could shoot that
long a distance and be as accurate . One took
a piece out of the seat of my pants at what
seemed a very long distance . Without a
telescope, he could not see to shoot that close.
After I got back I was watching the hill for
the two scouts and seen six Germans come
back and get one of the scouts ; I know that
he wasn't dead. They wouldn't let us get
up to the other one .
I have replacements that have never shot
a rifle . They came from Fort Knox from the
ooks' and Bakers' School. They came with
pistol belts and rifles . Most have never fired.
I have six of them .
The best way to fight is first artillery, then
tanks, and us to follow tanks up . That hill
is booby trapped and mined .
It is best to keep very quiet . At any time
at night whenever you make a slight noise
the enemy immediately opens up with machine
gun fire and mortars .
We can whip him if we can get to him .
AT TILE F ON T
At one place the enemy had machine
guns placed and protected by snipers . We
were to take the hill . I was 200 to 250 yards
from the enemy and was lying down . I seen
a sniper from the top of his nose up . I knew
that it would take a good shot and I had my
rifle pointed in his direction. I decided to
wait and finally he moved up to chest height
and I squeezed one off but didn't hit him .
Then I seen another, just his helmet, then
he raised and I squeezed another one off ; I
got him, he raised up on his toes and fell over.
I never did get any fire from them . I sent a
scout out to locate machine guns and a sniper
got him in the stomach. There was a bunch
on the hill that fired at everything . This scout
that got wounded knocked six out of one machine
gun nest with a hand grenade and the
other bunch thought that he was going to
throw another one and took off, but were cut
off from behind. That drove them back to
their gun.
All I know to do is to keep firing at them .
The boys have nicknamed the German
machine gun the `typewrites because it is so
fast
You can find anti-personnel mines if you
watch closely as you go along . You can see
three prongs sticking out. About seven
pounds of pressure will set them off . We
have taken them out and put the pins back .
We call them the `jumping jacks' .
One time a boy about 25 yards in front
of our half-track was fussing around and
digging in the ground. All of a sudden he
exclaimed, `Look what I have uncovered-a
bomb!' There was a large size bomb buried
in the ground . I told him to let it alone and
taped it off.
The boys always say that if you want to
spot an enemy plane in the sky to look about
2000 yards in front of the antiaircraft fire.

SERGEANT LELAND A . SUTHERLAND, ompany
""G"", 6th Armored Infantry, Maknassy,
5 April 1943 .
We were attached to the 2nd Battalion
when the last attack was made and we came
under fire. Just the minute we got up there
we made a night attack . The scouts drew
enemy fire. All the machine guns fired and
the men had to learn one thing-that was to
stay down. I lost three men. I can harp
and preach but the men won't get down. The
whole battalion tried to advance but couldn't,
so we had to encircle around the right .
OLONEL RINGSOK asked me how many
men I had . I told him I had 30 men . He took
us around the side and the objective we had
to take was one hill that night . We were
doing fine work as far as jobs could go . But
it got pretty expensive as far as men were
concerned . You could not buck that kind
of dug-in position with rifles, and the artillery
was no good-the enemy would just get
in holes until the firing was over, and come
out unhurt. I have learned that artillery
couldn't hurt you if you just got down in a
foxhole while the firing was going on . The
men soon learned to get down while they are
firing .
They have guns set up that don't have
a grazing fire, but cross-fire . They are set
up to get you on the sky line .
I have no experiences to relate, but have
had the hell scared out of me here for a
'month or so . I have learned that we have
to play for keeps . One thing them Germans
and Italians are like, a corporal in my platoon
says, like gray squirrels ; they can't stay
still, all you have to do is lay down and shoot
them as they pop up. If you wait long
/ N TUN / S / A
16
enough they will pop up . You just lie and
wait. I have got a couple of them myself . I
have seen them knocked down all the way
from here to Oran .
I think that my men are getting smarter
now. They learned from Kasserine Pass . We
lost vehicles and the men scattered. There is
safety in numbers. We had 40 men and got
through them. If you have a patrol of 10
men, and they spot you and shoot at you,
you don't shoot back-you leave. But if you
have a whole platoon you answer them back .
In our company we have not got many
replacements . We got sixteen last night .
Everyone felt good to get them . It made
my platoon feel fine. I put my best men
with them, I picked a good old man for each
new man. The old man showed the new one
just how to dig his fox hole and told him
everything. We were sorry they were mostly
from ooks' and Bakers' School. We need
riflemen .
Our medical battalion takes care of both
sides; if we find Germans we take them in
too . We had two brothers fighting side by
side. One time we had a machine gun nest
to take and one of the two brothers was in
my platoon. We got up to the place where
the machine gun was and this brother got
up to throw a grenade . He got hit in the
head but I know that he wasn't dead. We
couldn't bring him out . We were ordered
to carry on the attack . I don't know whether
he died or what happened to him . Do they
take care of our men the same way? A few
days ago the same kind of thing happened
and the German and Italian medics took care
of some of our boys. A medical corporal
went up there the other day to get one of our
wounded men and was waved back because
the area was booby trapped .
I think that they are the poorest rifle shots
on earth. Our main trouble has been the ar/
MTERV/EWS AT TI/E FRONT
tillery . The M 1 is our best gun . We argue
pro and con on the Springfields and ML's,
but it is the M 1 for me .
It took 3 squads to take a machine gun
nest on high ground at night by working up
by crawling. We got where he couldn't depress
the gun down enough to hit us . We
got him surrounded while the rest of them
drew fire. The men went forward and threw
hand grenades . He shot all around like a
cornered tom-cat. GENERAL WARD was
right up there with us . I was the man that
loaned the rifle to him and he drew fire for
us. His carbine had quit on him . I believe
he also threw a grenade at the machine gun
nest.
It is impossible to fight anybody that is
dug in when you have rifles only. One
doesn't consider the sniper dangerous ; you
consider him more of a harrasser . One thing
is, you can't find him out . I have had glasses
and never could spot them . We put machine
guns out in the night and take them in during
the day. In the day we have observation
posts, one man at them at all times. We have
the observation posts where the most trouble
is expected .
The first night at the front it would give
you the jitters . The enemy would send a
blast of fire to let you know that he was still
there, and they fire all kinds of fire-works .
He has one of the fastest guns I have
ever seen, but he is not accurate. He is the
poorest shot there is, or else I can run the
fastest and dodge the fastest of any one I
know.
The first flares that I seen I thought the
Germans were advancing on me . Now I
don't pay no attention to them, and we throw
them too. The German shoots like hell but
don't hit anything. You can see the tracers
going overhead. The first attack we made I
got one boy shot in the shoulder and it was
17
a long shot, about 1000 yards, but I guess
it was just a lucky shot .

STAFF SERGEANT SEABORN DU KETT, 6th
Armored Infantry, Maknassy, 5 April 1943 .
The first thing is to keep your head and
have good concealment. Keep your eyes
open because the Germans are pretty smart
and you have to keep awake to get them . At
Kasserine Pass I know we lost some men by
going to sleep. You got to be awake all the
time. We lost men by wanting to go to sleep .
They seem to get the idea that they should
have rest more than anything else . They
don't get scared until it is too late . Up at Kasserine
Pass a man didn't carry out orders that
he should have, orders to move to the top
of the mountain, and some of those that went
to sleep didn't come out . It is necessary to
obey orders . I believe that my men obey me
because they think that I know what I am
doing, and the new men seem to have confidence
in me. A lot depends on a smart
leader.
We have had no opportunity to use the
weapons on the half-tracks except for antiaircraft
fire.
What ranges for fire have you and the
enemy used?
Around 300 yards . The enemy lets you
get right on him before he fires . He lets you
get right into his traps and then opens up
with machine guns. I have had very little
rifle fire from the enemy.
Most of our casualties have been from
machine gun fire except one that was caused
by a bomb. We had four killed in the last
action, and none wounded.

PRIVATE JA K MOORE, ompany ""L"", 60th
Infantry, Maknassy, 5 April 1943.
It seems like everything the enemy uses
is designed to harrass a man . They start
7NK 6, 5 /N TNN/5 /A
firing at night and the guns seem to crack
overhead, and it makes it seem as if they
were right on top of you. Their tracers seem
to have curves on them . But if you wait, and
take it easy, you can soon tell where they
are. They have flares that make it look like
convoys coming down the road, and they
have flares that are good for nothing, but
make it seem like an attack is taking place .
They have snipers that don't have much of a
chance of hitting anything, but scare the hell
out of you . I am not afraid of it now anymore
but last Monday we took a pretty good beating
from their artillery . It was our second attack,
and many men were pretty scared, but
you readily realize that if you are in the
ground it is pretty ineffective . I try to tell
the men to take it easy . On a patrol the
other day we were looking over an area in
which it was understood there was a machine
gun. We went out and looked around and
nothing happened until we got past it . When
most of the men got past the gun it started
in. We looked all around to find it . One
sergeant got hit twice in the hand and started
to look for a better position to get in . I don't
believe there were any better positions . It
was just as good to lay on the flat ground .
They have a mortar up there . and nobody has
ever got up to it. We hear vehicles that I
guess are bringing ammunition to them . At
night they fire several rounds just for nothing .
Most of them have good guns and it seems as
if they shoot at everything. If a man was over
there with a gun and the enemy knew that
he couldn't hit him, he would shoot anyway .
Three days I laid up there out of gun range,
but they would shoot.
We are doing all right. We got a new
bunch last night and they were jittery and
nervous at first and because of it we nearly
lost a lieutenant . I don't blame the new men
for getting jumpy . The sergeant put these
men in digging new positions. One of the
18
fellows was digging when another man came
up. He gave the countersign but the new
man, because lie was jittery I guess, didn't
hear it, reached down and brought his gun
up and fired. It was lucky that he missed
though; the distance was about eight feet .
The other day a few got scared and made a
run for it, but a second lieutenant got them
back in their positions and they stayed it out .
This was during a real shrapnel barrage . They
took it pretty good . We were glad to get
replacements and they are very anxious to
learn . I believe that no matter how long a
man has been in the Army, until he hears that
first one go over, he is a rookie .

APTAIN GAIL H. BROWN, 60th Infantry,
Maknassy, 5 April 1943 .
I have learned considerable from many
true experiences, first of all about foxholes .
It is something no one back in the States
realizes the importance of, until he actually
comes under fire. The next thing I would
consider important is being able to shoot
at the proper time rather than wasting ammunition;
this was a big thing at our landing
at Port Lyautey.
The next thing that I noticed up here,
the first night we hit here and made the attack
towards the big hill, was a massing of
troops when they came under fire . They
herded together like sheep . I was weapons
commander at the time. I found machine
guns emplaced close together and where they
had no field of fire. The heavy machine guns
and light machine guns placed close together.
However, after organizing my own
machine guns and mortars and trying to help
the infantry to spread out and get a field of
fire, they actually learned for themselves,
because that night enemy artillery and mortar
fell in on us. As it was they were spread
/IV TER VIEW S
out and well dispersed . The troops learn
very fast .
The next thing that I find important is
the getting of information down to the troops,
for the very simple reason that they don't
know what is happening and they don't know
what to expect and what to do at the proper
time.- It has been emphasized before, but
the officers don't seem to realize the importance
of it. The discipline is very good
and the morale high . Replacements seem to
help in this because it seems like the men
have someone new to talk to and tell stories
to. At one time we were to get replacements
and were told that they were coming
in but they didn't come . The morale went
down a lot that night. Last night they came
in and we told them to dig foxholes and
everything that we learned by experience.
The replacements look like a good bunch of
boys. They were a little scared at first because
they didn't know what to expect and
the people at the rear told them so many
different stories . The replacements arrived
last night and received baptism of mortar
fire this morning . Nobody was hurt because
they dug all night and had good foxholes .
We remove enemy mines by tying a heavy
stick on a rope and dragging them out and
exploding them. Handle the booby traps in
the same way .
I had one experience that I will never
forget. It was the second day of battle and
we were making an attack that night .
OLONEL TOFFEE, Battalion ommander,
was just wounded in the knee and the Executive
Officer was in the Rear ommand Post.
I was up by GENERAL WILBUR, who had
been up at the time to reorganize the troops
on the ridge. Then I went on up and got
on top to help in this and found no American
troops but looked into the faces of German
troops. I got two incendiary bombs thrown
19
AT THE FONT
in my face and was shot at also . I shot back
and believe that I got one . Then my pistol
wouldn't work any more so I got out of there.
I later found out that the boys were back rcorganizing
.
Most of our casualties have been from
mortars and artillery and some machine gun
fire. They open up with machine gun fire
at night and our machine guns fire back .
Then they open up with mortars and artillery
fire. The mortars seemed to be coming
in from the back of us .

In tank fighting nothing is more important
than expert reconnaissance of your routes
of advance and withdrawal . Several times
both we and the Germans have moved up
on what we thought was a good clear route
,only to find a dry wash, nine or ten feet high,
blocking our way, causing us to withdraw .
In this country, too, we've learned to move
slowly so as not to reveal our position . You
can't boil up to battle at high speed without
broadcasting your coming in a big cloud of
dust.
German antitank gunnery has made our
reconnaissance a particularly tough job . They
drag their big 88-mm guns up behind their
tanks and drop them in position . Usually the
crew digs the gun in a hole, twelve by twelve
by six feet deep, practically covering up the
shield and exposing only the barrel of the
gun. We've found those guns particularly hard

before my arrival . I had a copy of them and we

to locate and they can break up your entire
show if you don't pick them up in time . Apparently
they use mats to hide the muzzle
blast. Once we hunted a gun within a
thousand yards for three days and then only
found it by spotting the personnel approaching
the gun position .
Generally they try to suck you into an
antitank gun trap . Their light tanks will
bait you in by playing around just outside
effective range. When you start after them,
they turn tail and draw you in within range
of their 88-mm guns . First they open up on
you with their guns in depth . Then when
you try to flank them you find yourself tinder
fire of carefully concealed guns at a shorter
range . We've just got to learn to pick those
guns up before closing in on them .
Although we've knocked down several
enemy aircraft we find that our men are having
trouble with their leads . You've got to
shoot planes as you would ducks . The big
fault with our antiaircraft fire is that about
sixty percent of it does not have enough lead .
Our boys don't seem to realize the speed of
those ships. The .50 caliber machine guns,
/N 7!/N/5 /4

however, will keep 'em high ; German pilots
seem to despise the stuff.
The basic training they had in the States
means a lot to our boys over here . Every
time they hit the ground you'll find them digging
a helluva big hole . I have yet to see
one man get hit in a properly dug slit trench .
One of my lads dug a shallow one and he
came out with a bullet hole clear through
the cheeks of his tail. You don't have to
mention light discipline to them . They'll
hoop and holler at anyone who uses a light
at night, regardless of rank.
We've also learned that it's important for
everyone to know what to do with wounds,
especially shock . Although I saw one man
die of shock from a simple hand wound, I've
also seen our men save almost five hundred
casualties by prompt treatment of their
wounds with sulpha drugs and proper treatment
for shock. Most of the sulpha drugs
are administered by the men themselves . A
couple of weeks ago one of my sergeants
fixed up a man who had been severely
wounded on the head and neck when lie was
/NTER VIEW S
blown ofi a tank . Today, the man is back
in action .
The support artillery gives us is only as
good as their observer . ommanders must
get in the habit of assigning their best men
as artillery observers .
Our 37-mm guns will knock out tanks if
the crews will only camouflage their guns
perfectly and then hold fire until the enemy
comes in at point blank range . German camouflage
is excellent ; it's hard to believe they
can hide a gun as well as they do . The rifle
grenade is a good weapon at close quarters
and will knock out anything under a Mark VI .
When the Germans go into position they'll
hide their guns and tanks in anything, including
Arab huts . And then they dress
their personnel in Arab garb while going
to and from their positions. Usually they'll
try to suck you inside of a 1200 yard range .
They frequently use machine guns to range
themselves in and you.can duck their shells
by watching their machine gun fire. When
they're moving they'll shoot at anything that
looks suspicious and they'll generally knock
down every Arab house in sight. We think
that's a good idea and are beginning to follow
suit . Sometimes they'll get the range with
high burst smoke shells. But when we see
three of those in a line we take off-that's the
high sign for the Stukas . When firing, we
always shoot low-even the ricochets will
hit them. Most of our misses have been high.
We also need a good system for identifying
friendly tanks . Once when my radio was
knocked out I heard my own tanks turning
their guns on me-and I really sweated out
that approach . At dusk it's always hard to
tell which vehicles are friendly, and we're
always afraid to shoot until they're right on
top of us. When the Stukas come over, the
German tanks send up a line of rockets and
orange smoke to show their positions.
AT THE FRONT
2 1
One evening several Mark l\'s followed
a British tank column right up to their tank
park until a 25 pounder battery spotted the
strangers on the tail of the column and blew
them off the road.
In using tanks in action, take it very slowly
. Germans do it that way all the time .
Do not shift gears once you start, particularly
in the dusk, because the backfires will give
you away . Keep the tanks out of column at
all times . Never travel in column, travel in
V, line, wedge, but never in column . Stay
off the roads. Get off the roads and never
use them . You don't need an assembly area
for a reinforced battalion . You can go right
into action without first using an area . Push
your tank destroyers well forward, and keep
your infantry ahead.
It is according to the situation whether
the infantry goes ahead of the tanks. If it
is a defense position that has had a chance
to organize positively and definitely, I would
most certainly have the infantry with the
tanks . I would have them follow the tanks
on foot, but I would have the infantry right
there. Once those 88-mm guns start to bark,
you can't pick them up in your tank . Attack
them with infantry . Get the infantry
out of the half-tracks . Don't take any thinskinned
vehicles with the tanks, they open
on them the first thing. Don't take your assault
guns or mortars with your tanks, because
they will smash them in open country.
The artillery observer has got to be right
with the assault company commander or the
tank battalion commander, and I mean not
more than 35 or 40 yards away . Of course
that is standard operating procedure . I just
mention it because it is so necessary .
Teach your commanders to stay out of
the fight until they are the last tank or thereabouts.
They are too prone to become inT
N K E R S
terested in a personal duel, and forget about
their control of the units .
A reconnaissance of the field, if you are
lucky enough to be able to make it, is the
most important thing I can think of .
Medium tanks don't get bogged down so
easily. If you come to a bog, don't ever let
them try to shift gears, shift before.
The Germans bring their 88-mm guns
towed behind their tanks (may be 75-mm
guns, or both-I know they bring 88-mm
guns). They tow them up and dig in . Their
tanks come out and get your attention and,
unless you know their tricks, they lead you
right between their guns and they get behind
you and get you. Don't always bite
at the first 88-mm guns which shoot- at you .
There will be several up much closer. The
first 88-mm gun that barks and the first tank
are generally bait and you shouldn't plunge
at them. If they stage any night attack or
late evening attack and neither side stays
there, they will come out and put their 88-mm
guns in no-man's-land away ahead of where
their tank positions are. Their tanks were
within 1000 yards of the Pass, but their guns
were 4000 yards ahead of the Pass .
Four 88-mm guns, if dug in, are a match
for any tank company . They are the most
wonderful things to camouflage I have ever
seen. They are very low to the ground . You
can watch the fire coming in, little dust balls
on the ground give them away and show
how low they are. They just skip along
the ground. The pit is 12 by 12 by 6. The
gun looks like a pencil or black spot. The
shield is level with the piece and all you can
effectively see is the tube. The crew is even
dressed in Arab clothes, and they do everything
to camouflage their position . You can
get them out with high eplosive ammuni-
/ N j!J N / S / 4
22
tion, with your artillery . If a tank gun can
find them, you can get them out . Over 1200
yards there is no use worrying about them .
Their shells bounce off the medium tank at
that range . Under 1200 yards, watch out .
The enemy's gunnery stinks at long ranges .
I feel that our men are better. If we -can
fight a tank for a tank and a gun, I think we
can do it, and that is giving them great odds,
because I would say the gun is worth - four
tanks, but we can do it .
You can see the shells coming . You can
watch the adjustments they are making.
They all seem to be short and behind. Then
they get up and begin to shoot under the
tank. During this time, we knocked out four
tanks . We picked off the leader . You can
tell after awhile which is the leader by the
difference in the vehicles . They pick at such
things as half-tracks with two antennas, etc .,
and we caught on after a while. When you
get one of their commanders they stop and
seem sort of dazed.
The ten German tanks were sitting on a
ridge shooting at half-tracks . They had been
at my left rear and I hadn't seen them. There
was a Mark VI, Mark IV's, and some Mark
111's.-They stopped on the crest and did a
right flank and started to get in column. They
will put a Mark VI in the middle and the
others on the flanks, always making one flank
heavier than the other, however. We- picked
out one and hit him and he stopped. We
burned the next one . Then the Mark VI,
which I thought was a Mark IV, came close .
They are hard to identify, but have a more
or less square outline, with an offset box

"mination and drive to
get things done, even if barren of original ideas, may draw
inspiration elsewhere and will be useful as an executive even if his
lack of original imagination limits the field of his usefulness.
Often when I have enquired of an officer as to why orders which I
have issued are not being followed, I have received the reply
orders have been issued about it. Such a reply shows complete
lack of realization of the responsibility of that officer to get things
done. It is the result that counts  the issue of clear orders is only
a means to an end and the end is not obtained if orders are ignored.
An officer is not given a responsible post in command of men, to act
as a human loud speaker machine and repeat orders in parrot
fashion. He is there to get results  to get things done. His
determination to get results must be made quite clear to his
subordinates before and on the day of battle.
(b) Loyalty  Every commander has the right to assume the loyalty
of his subordinates unless by his own action, inefficiency or lack of
judgement he has sacrificed that loyalty. Concerted action,
cohesion and co-ordination  essentials to success in battle  can
only be achieved if all subordinate commanders down through the
chain of command are determined loyally to enforce the instructions
and decisions of their seniors. Unco-ordinated individual efforts
may result in brilliant exploits but unless directed towards a
common end they will make small contribution to success in war.
History is full of examples of the success of a disciplined soldiery
against a mod of fanatically brave individuals. The all star team
 a collection of brilliant individual players suddenly brought
together and lacking cohesion, seldom succeeds against the well
drilled good team which has trained as such and has unity of
direction. There is ample scope for individual brilliance and
initiative in modern war  the latter is essential  but this
characteristic must be directed towards the attainment of a common
object and not into divergent channels on the whim of individuals.
(c) Self Confidence  A commander who has not confidence in
himself, cannot inspire confidence in his superiors or subordinates.
Troops who lack confidence in their leaders do not win battles.
(d) Sense of Duty  Sincerity and honesty of purpose. In war, the
From Captain to Corps Commander
23
issues at stake are far too great to allow room for individual
selfishness or prejudices. The proper fulfillment of his duty, as his
conscience dictates, must be the most important consideration in a
soldiers life. If sense of duty is lacking in the leader, it cannot be
expected to be present in the troops. Without it, the determination to
see through the doubtful battle will not exist.
MENTAL QUALITIES
(e) Knowledge  A commander cannot inspire confidence unless he
has a thorough knowledge of his job. Without it he cannot gain the
confidence of his superiors or his subordinates and this will result in
wavering and indecision in battle.
The knowledge required of a commander varies with the size of his
command. He must understand the technique of handling the
various arms and types of units which he may be called upon to
control in battle. He must know the technique of how to command 
how to delegate to his subordinates and his staff, how to control,
how to position himself on the battlefield and make use of his
communications, and, most importantly of all, he must have an
understanding of human nature and how to get at men.
(Knowledge of human nature coupled with determination combine to
make the art of man mastership).
Knowledge must come from hard study and harder thought.
(f) Judgement  Judgement is the application of knowledge to
particular problems and situations. War is a risky business and in
battle a commander is constantly called upon to face risks. A battle
plan from which all risks have been eliminated is one so obvious
that the enemy will probably have it countered before it will have
materialized in action. Battle planning and execution are largely
problems of balancing risks. It is judgement backed by knowledge
that must decide for a commander what risks are acceptable and
what risks are unacceptable. If judgement be faulty, bad risks will
be taken, failures will result and the confidence of the troops will be
lost.
(g) Initiative  Every commander in every grade must be prepared
to act on his own knowledge and judgement without having to lean
on his superior. If his knowledge and judgement tell him that
certain action should be taken, he should take it. This he will fail to
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
24
do unless he possesses the quality of initiative.
(h) Mental Alertness  Time is vital in war. Commanders must be
quick to grasp the essentials of an operational plan and of orders
and instructions issued to them and quick to grasp a situation and
the significance of events as they occur.
PHYSICAL QUALITIES
(j) Physical Fitness  Unless a man is physically fit, he cannot
remain mentally fit in the stress of battle. Every commander is
responsible for keeping himself and his troops in a physical
condition which will enable them to withstand the mental and
physical strains to which they may be subjected.
(k) Skill at Arms  An officer must possess the necessary skill at
arms in the weapons he may be called upon to handle in battle.
(l) Youth  A man is never too young for a job, but he may well be
too old, for age reduces speed of mental and physical reaction. If
an officer is fit to command a unit at twenty-five, he will be twice as
good at thirty-five. I am not suggesting that experience is not
valuable  on the contrary it is very valuable indeed. But
experience must be very clearly distinguished from the number of
years a man has lived or the number of years he has served in a
certain capacity or the number of different appointments he has
held. Experience is only useful insofar as it represents knowledge
acquired or knowledge confirmed by practical application. A man
who has prepared himself for a certain type of work by previous
thought and study, will gain more by practical application than one
who has stepped into the same work without preparation. Some can
serve a life span in a single appointment and absorb less about all
its aspects than another may pick up in two weeks.

HONOURS AND AWARDS
1. The correct allocation of honours and awards is of great importance,
since it affects morale. If decorations are distributed too freely they lose
their value in the eyes of the Army as a whole and to the recipients.
Conversely the recognition of valuable service by the award of a
decoration is a just encouragement to others and in the best interests of
the Service  particularly when considered in relation to promotion which
must be based upon the promise of ability to perform a task in a higher
sphere and NOT upon past services rendered.
2. The regulations governing honours and awards are given in Royal
Warrants and official publications. The views and policies given below
are intended to guide and assist Commanders in submitting
recommendations. They will provide the basis upon which I will
scrutinize all recommendations when passing for consideration by higher
authority.
3. Active soldiering is a risky business and the normal performance of
duties, varying in each sphere and with the role of the Arm, is inseparable
from the element of risk. Commanders must bear in mind that the
purpose of a campaign medal is to give recognition to the performance of
normal duties in a Theatre of Operations where risks form part of the day
to day business of soldiering. The idea that special honours should be
liberally awarded to individuals for normal performance of their duties
because it is all they get out of it, cannot be entertained for it cuts
across the fundamental principle of military service. A soldier serves to
do his duty and serve his country  not for what he gets out of it. On
the other hand the soldier who bears the responsibility and runs the risks
of actual combat with the enemy deserves some distinction to show he has
withstood the test.
4. A proper allocation of honours and awards should 
(a) Give recognition to exceptional acts, or duties performed
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
26
with outstanding ability, or recognition of exacting duties performed
unfailingly during a difficult or long period.
(b) Encourage aggressiveness and skill and the offensive spirit.
(c) Discourage foolhardiness or the unnecessary and useless
risk of lives and equipment. I look to every Commander to strictly
discourage any form of medal hunting.
(d) To give recognition to acts of such outstanding gallantry that
they are an example to the Army for all time.
5. The value of the service rendered is the first consideration in any
award. The service rendered may be measured in terms of effect against
the enemy or in terms of outstanding gallantry affording an example and
inspiration to the whole Army, or in terms of a valuable contribution,
effecting the efficiency or well-being of the Army or the general war
effort.
6. Awards for Services in Combat with the Enemy (VC, DSO, MC, DCM,
MM)
(a) With the exception of personnel of the Medical, or Chaplains
Services which are dealt with under a separate heading below,
recommendees by their act or acts must have made, or contributed
directly to, an effective blow against the enemy  the direct
contribution to the success of battle, on the battlefield  is the
standard by which such recommendations will be judged. Except in
most extraordinary circumstances, acts of gallantry NOT directly
contributing to damage to the enemy (such as rescuing of our own
personnel, salvage of equipment,, extricating a unit or sub-unit from
a difficult position) will NOT be considered for these awards even if
performed in the presence of the enemy and under fire.
(b) The act or acts forming the basis of recommendations must
be in the line of duty (for example, an artillery FOO [Forward
Observation Officer] who, in the heat of battle leaves his OP
[observation post] and joins in the infantry fight may put up a very
gallant show, but if it was possible for him to have continued giving
support to forward troops by remaining at his OP then he should not
be considered for an award. To give an award in such a case
encourages foolhardiness as opposed to performance of duty).
(c) The act or acts for these awards must have been carried out
From Captain to Corps Commander
27
under fire and the citation must so state.
(d) Except in very special and extraordinary circumstances and
for Chaplains and Medical personnel, the above rules exclude the
award of these decorations to personnel of the Services whose duties
do not require them to directly deal a blow against the enemy. This
should be realized by the personnel of such Services when it is
decided that their contribution is best made in their service rather
than in a unit which takes direct action against the enemy, and
accords with the principle that a soldiers duty is to render the
service for which he is best fitted by experience and training. The
Provost Service is an exception in that control of traffic in the
forward area at difficult diversions or bottlenecks, under hostile fire,
contributes directly to a blow at the enemy in that it may be
dependent upon the forward movement of supporting arms.
(e) Chaplains and Medical personnel are eligible for these
decorations, for their primary duties are concerned with the
physical and spiritual welfare of casualties on the battlefield. Acts
of rescue under fire are legitimate cases for awards to officers and
soldiers of these Services as it is in their line of first duty.
Commanders and Commanding Officers must remember however
that medical personnel and clerics wear the Red Cross, giving them
a measure of protection not available to combat personnel. There
have been instances where the enemy have obviously refrained from
firing at soldiers or vehicles bearing the Red Cross, and in assessing
acts by medical personnel and clerics, this must be considered.
(f) Except for the VC [Victoria Cross], recommendations for the
above decorations may be either immediate or periodical. The
immediate recommendation is for a single act and the majority of
deserving cases can be covered by the immediate award. Certain
categories of Staff Officer, through a long period of valuable service
in the area of contact may be recommended for a periodical award.
(g) As a general guide, (except in the case of medical officers or
Chaplains) to earn the DSO the act or acts for which an officer is
recommended must have contributed directly to the success of the
battle, at least and unmistakably on the brigade level, and more
usually on the divisional level.
For the award of the MG [machine gun] an officer should have
contributed directly to the success of the battle, at least and
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
28
unmistakably on a battalion level, and more usually on a brigade
level.
(h) In the case of the VC the act must be so outstanding as to
provide an example to the Army for all time and its effect in damage
to the enemy and furtherance of operations must be marked beyond
question and of first importance. Whenever a case is considered for
a recommendation for the VC, as far as operational circumstances
permit, the Brigade Commander concerned should visit the ground
accompanied by the eye-witnesses of the act. Each eye-witness
should be called forward, out of hearing of others, and describe to
the Brigadier, on the ground, exactly what he saw. These accounts
should be taken down at the time and eventually attached to the
recommendation.
(i) It is quite legitimate to give recognition to outstanding work
of a unit by an award to its commanding officer, for there would be
no question as to who would bear the responsibility if it did badly.
7. Awards for Gallantry for Acts not in Combat with the Enemy (GC,
GM, Commendations for Gallantry)
Passive acts of gallantry, not directly contributing to damage to the
enemy, or outside the area of contact, may be rewarded by the GC, or
GM, and recommendations should be submitted accordingly.
8. Awards not requiring an Element of Gallantry (CB, CBE, OBE, MBE,
BEM, CM, Mention in Despatches
These awards are intended for recognition of valuable service rendered
NOT necessarily in combat with the enemy. Those who have not had the
opportunity of directly contributing to damage to the enemy may
nevertheless have rendered exceptional service, and should receive first
consideration for these awards. Anyone, providing they qualify within the
regulations laid down for each decoration, is eligible to earn, for
exceptional services, a periodical award of one of these decorations.
9. It must be remembered that, in their final form citations are published
in the Gazette. They must be accurate as to fact, include essential details
such as date, time and place and be worded in good, simple English.
Citations for immediate awards must be based on one or two specific acts
during a particular phase and if drafted to cover a period will not gain
acceptance. Carelessness in submitting citations results in delays to
collect details, in rewriting and in getting signatures on redrafted
From Captain to Corps Commander
29
documents when there is always the possibility that the original initiators
may have become casualties. It is important that deserving cases should
be rewarded certainly and without delay.
10. Commanders and Commanding Officers should be careful to see that
outstanding acts by individuals of supporting Arms and Services, working
under command or in support, are brought to the attention of the
Commander of the Arm or Service concerned, otherwise there is always
the possibility that deserving cases may be overlooked.
11. I particularly caution Commanders and Commanding Officers
against submitting recommendation for individuals who render them
personal services, such as their drivers or orderlies. Commanders must
bear in mind that these individuals are very much under their eye.
They must compare their services with those of the infantry section leader
who during a period of operations may daily lead his section into battle in
the forward area. The place for individuals of the former type to earn
decorations, is serving with their units, and such personnel are eligible
for a general campaign medal. I do not mean that such individuals
should be excluded if, in very exceptional circumstances, they carry out
an act of gallantry beyond their duties. But it has an adverse effect on
morale of fighting troops if those in positions of little or no responsibility
but close to the Commander and under his personal observation seem to
come by decorations more easily than the front line soldier.
12. The final criterion of a good or bad award is the reaction of the
troops. If the troops feel it is a good award, it is a good award. If awards
are criticized by the fighting troops they are bad awards. Before
forwarding any recommendation, at each level, the Commander should
ask himself the question would the front line soldier, if he knew the facts,
consider this well deserved.

CHAPTER 2
Normandy:
The July Battles
The battle of Normandy did not develop according to plan. Much attention
had been paid to the problems of getting and staying ashore, and these
operations were brilliantly successful. However, Montgomery, his army
commander Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey and the corps commanders,
Lieutenant-General John Crocker (1 Corps) and Lieutenant-General G.C.
Bucknell (30 Corps), paid less attention to plans for breaking out of the
bridgehead. They seem to have assumed that the Germans would wear themselves
out in large, patterned counter-attacks, creating the conditions for a breakout
battle. When heavy losses in the bridgehead forced Rommel and his generals to
establish a new defensive perimeter drawing in all available troops to prevent an
Allied breakthrough, the battle was transformed.
All across Normandy, German defences were echeloned in depth, with
forward outposts, a lightly manned main defensive line and strong local reserves
including tanks and/or self-propelled assault guns available to carry out immediate
local counter-attacks. This defensive zone was 700 to 1000 metres deep,
supported by artillery, mortar and Nebelwefer positions camouflaged in woods or
on reverse slopes. Allied air superiority and the crushing power of naval guns
made the assembly of large forces for a major counter-attack nearly impossible, so
emphasis was placed on dispersing armour into penny packets to provide
immediate tactical support. According to German reports from the battlefront the
Panzer Division had become an anachronism. In Normandy Panzers could
only be employed piecemeal in support of infantry at most in squadron strength.1
Montgomerys first attempt to overcome the enemys defences, Operation
EPSOM was launched on 25 June with Lieutenant-General Richard OConnors
8th British Corps ordered to attack on an eight-kilometre front between Norreyen-
Bessin and Tilly-sur-Seulles. OConnor, like Simonds, had been planning and
training for a breakout battle, but the situation confronting his corps was rather
different than the one either he or Simonds had envisaged in England. The right
flank of the EPSOM start line was classic Normandy bocage  small, hedgerowed
fields in hilly, broken countryside. OConnor decided to squeeze his three
unblooded divisions, 15th Scottish, 43rd Wessex and 11th Armoured through a
three kilometre wide corridor in the relatively open country on the left flank. His
troops would have to overcome a regiment of 12th SS Panzer Division plus
powerful Panzer Lehr units holding the high ground north of the River Odon with
strong reverse-slope positions. Once this was accomplished the corps would have
to cross the heavily wooded valley and the Odon River before attacking the flattopped
ridge south of the river known by its altitude as Hill 112.2 The II SS Panzer
Corps had reached Paris from Poland on 24 June and its lead elements, together
with I SS Panzer Division, were within a days march of the Odon battlefield.3
This was not the kind of force ratio envisaged in planning breakout battles.
OConnor drew upon 30th Corps to stage a protective advance on his right
flank but both this attack, Operation MARTLET, and the advance by 15th Scottish
Division were slowed by determined Panzer battle groups. OConnor believed he
had to commit 11th Armoured Division to gain momentum though it was
supposed to be used to exploit success. On Day 2 the combined forces of the two
divisions fought their way to the river, seized an intact bridge and reached the
lower slopes of Hill 112, forming the infamous Scottish Corridor  a threekilometre
wide, eight-kilometre deep spike driven into the heart of the enemy
defences that quickly became a salient, subject to withering fire from three sides.
Montgomery ordered OConnor to press ahead using 43rd Division to
widen the corridor on the left flank. This decision forced the Germans to employ
II SS Panzer Corps in a series of piecemeal attacks. Thanks to Ultra, 8th Corps
was forewarned and was able to dig-in and prepare to meet the SS battle groups.
EPSOM ended when II SS Panzer Corps was halted by the most intense artillery
fire [including] British naval artillery. After suffering grievous losses the
Germans abandoned the Odon and reformed their defences on Hill 112.4
Operation EPSOM was a considerable success because it forced the
enemy to use a panzer corps brought from the eastern front to prevent a
breakthrough. Once committed, it proved difficult to withdraw 9th and 10th SS
Divisions from the battle zone, foreclosing the opportunity to mount a corps-level
counter-attack before the Allied build-up was complete. On the other hand,
EPSOM proved to be a very costly battle for 2nd British Army, which suffered
more than 5000 casualties, 75 per cent of them in infantry battalions, in a single
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
32
Normandy: The July Battles
week.5
OConnor believed the key lesson of EPSOM was that Normandy had
become more like a First World War battlefield requiring bite and hold tactics. He
argued that the German positions south of the Odon could best be overcome in a
series of engagements that would so soften the enemy that when we wanted to
pass the river we should have little difficulty in doing so.6 Simonds, whose
information about the battle was largely second hand, remained convinced that
assaulting tanks and infantry could, in the initial phase of an attack aim at
penetration of not less than 4000 yards to capture German mortar positions or
force their re-disposition simplifying the business of mopping up. This could
be accomplished he believed if the assaulting troops kept up with their covering
fire.
Simonds stressed this approach in a document drafted at his Tactical
Headquarters in Normandy on 1 July. During the following week he witnessed
Operation WINDSOR, the attack on Carpiquet and its airfield and Operation
CHARNWOOD, the assault on the northern defences of Caen. Finally on the
afternoon of 11 July 1944, 2nd Canadian Corps became operational under Second
British Army and Simonds began preparations for his first corps-level operation.
The 3rd Canadian Infantry Division rejoined the corps a few days later and on
16 July Simonds gathered the officers of 3rd Division and 2nd Canadian
Armoured Brigade together to introduce himself and his policy in the tactical
handling of troops and in administration generally. (The draft document of 1 July
and the transcript of his 16 July talk are reproduced at the end of this chapter.)
After the capture of Caen on 8-9 July Montgomery issued a new directive.
The Americans, he noted, were now facing some 70 infantry battalions and
250 tanks so progress in the bocage was bound to be slow. It was up to 2nd British
Army to stage operations that would have a direct influence on the American
effort7 by attracting enemy forces to the eastern flank. This meant mounting a new
offensive east of the Orne. Montgomery decided to transform 8th Corps into a
force composed of three armoured divisions and to order OConnor to stage an
armoured blitzkrieg from the Orne bridgehead east of Caen towards Falaise. The
Canadian role in Operation GOODWOOD, known as Operation ATLANTIC, was
outlined in some detail by the Army Commander, General Dempsey. The 2nd
Canadian Corps was to clear the industrial suburbs of Caen on the right flank of
the 8th Corps advance and then secure the western end of the ridgeline south of
Caen. Simonds had little opportunity to influence the initial stages of the
operation, which were determined by the air and artillery plans, but on the night
of 19 July he made his first major command decision in Normandy. Operation
GOODWOOD was grinding to a halt on the slopes of what the British called

Bourguebus Ridge. The 8th Corps had lost more than 300 tanks to enemy armour
and anti-tank guns, and both 11th and the Guards Armoured Divisions had to be
withdrawn to recover from their losses. General Dempsey told Simonds to relieve
the armoured divisions as quickly as possible and complete the consolidation of
the bridgehead around Pt. 67  Ifs  Hubert Folie, a task that was completed by
the evening of 19 July.8
Simonds thought that much more could be accomplished. One brigade of
2nd Canadian Division had seized the Pt. 67  Ifs area and was holding it against
small-scale German counter-attacks. Simonds believed that if a second brigade
attacked through this position securing a grip on the northern, reverse slope, of
what the Canadians called Verrières Ridge, most of the objectives assigned to the
corps in the GOODWOOD plan would be reached. He ordered Major-General
Charles Foulkes, GOC 2nd Canadian Division, to employ 6th Brigade with the
Essex Scottish from 4th Brigade under command, to carry out the attack the next
day, 20 July.9 Unfortunately it took much more time than Simonds had hoped to
move the brigade, marry it up with the armour and arrange the fire plan. By the
time the attack got underway the enemys battle groups were in position on their
reverse slope. When heavy rain ended both air support and artillery observation,
the Germans overwhelmed the advancing troops with a series of well-orchestrated
counter-attacks.
Operation GOODWOOD was a failure at the tactical level. No vital
ground had been gained and Allied casualties vastly exceeded those inflicted on
the enemy. Fortunately the German generals tried to snatch defeat from the jaws
of victory when Field Marshal Günther Von Kluge decided the enemy must be
thrown back across the line Caen-Troarn by concentric attacks.10 These counterattacks
cost the Germans precious, irreplaceable resources and achieved little.
As the German attacks eased, Montgomery, under pressure from
Eisenhower, announced that he would launch a new series of left-right blows on
either side of the Orne beginning with an attack by 2nd Canadian Corps on
25 July.11 Dempsey gave Simonds verbal orders for this operation, code-named
SPRING, on 22 July, allocating both 7th and Guards Armoured divisions to the
corps. Dempsey wanted Simonds to conduct a limited operation designed to
secure the second phase objectives of GOODWOOD. There was no suggestion of
a breakout and OConnor, who expected the British armoured divisions to return
to his corps in a few days, sought out Simonds to make sure that there would be
no repetition of GOODWOOD tactics. After the meeting, OConnor wrote to the
commander of the Guards Armoured Division urging him to go cautiously with
your armour you are not doing a rush to Paris  it is the capture of a wood by
combined armour and infantry; so as an operation, not quite the same background

as the last.12
Verrières Ridge is barely discernable at its eastern end, but towards the
Orne a wide u-shaped valley separates Pt. 67 and St. André-sur-Orne from Pt. 88
and the village of May-sur-Orne. Intelligence reports from Ultra and other sources
had established the German order of battle, and Simonds knew that the corps
would confront a well dug-in enemy with ample local reserves. His solution was
to try and secure the ridge in a two-phase attack beginning in full darkness. If the
first phase battalions could secure the small villages on the crest of the ridge then
three fresh infantry battalions supported by armoured squadrons, artillery and the
tactical air force might penetrate the enemys defences at first light capturing or
forcing the withdrawal of his mortar and anti-tank guns.
Operation SPRING turned out to be the worst single-day disaster
experienced by the Canadians since the Dieppe raid of August 1942. Except in the
centre, where the first phase objective, Vèrrieres village, was below the crest,
allowing the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry to secure a defensible position, the
initial advance broke down in confusion. Simonds, misled by fragmentary
reports, ordered the second phase to begin and the enemy savaged the battalions
that attempted to cross the ridge.13 Simonds offered his own analysis of SPRING
shortly after the battle and in a report written for the official historian, which has
been reproduced for this chapter.

33 . COOPERATION .-a. The speed, fire power, armor protecon,
and crushing power of the tank must be used to the
tmost . To secure the maximum effectiveness of these
haracteristics, the tank commander must control his crew
nd the crew must have the maximum of coordination and
ooperation .
b, The tank commander in accordance with orders of the
llatoon or section leader, or on his own initiative when such
rders are lacking, controls the direction of movement by
rders to the driver and controls the fire by orders to the
pinners. Crew members must be trained, however, to act
nstinctively. The tank commander should not have to give
ong, detailed orders. In fact, he will not have time to do
that. His orders must be brief .
c. The tank commander directs the driver to drive in a
ertain direction or on a certain point . From time to time he
ells him to vary the direction as necessary . The driver makes
hanges of directionao avoid irregularities in the ground, to
ake advantage of good terrain, and to avoid antitank gun fire .
He must not make a sudden change of direction or stop
without notifying the tank commander and gunner. Such
action will interfere with the aim of the gunners .
d. The tank commander designates targets to the gunners
and controls the fire of the guns by specifying the type of
ammunition, if necessary, and by adjusting fire . The gunner
must instinctively know and use the proper type of ammunition
.

SECTION III
TANK PLATOON
â¢ 36. GENERAL,-The tank platoon usually operates as a unit
although sections or individual tanks may operate alone in
certain situations . The platoon commander controls his
! tanks by section or by individual tank .
5 37. FIRST ECHELON.--a. Tanks of the first echelon advance
rapidly under support of all available supporting weaponsartillery,
infantry weapons, and other tanks . When they
meet resistance, platoons use fire and maneuver to reduce
,that resistance . Tank platoon leaders keep their company
(commander constantly informed of the situation, their losses,
lenemy resistance, and action taken. Call upon the company
commander for artillery fire as needed.
b. The platoon commander of the leading wave of the first
echelon should comply with the following :
(1) Do not permit tanks to be diverted from their primary
mission by firing at unimportant targets .
(2) When resistance is met, use fire and maneuver.
(3) Select targets and give fire missions to the platoon .
(4) Use speed and terrain to accomplish mission .
(5) After a local attack, concentrate the platoon, reorganize,
and continue on mission.
(6) Keep company commander constantly informed of
the situation.
c. The tank platoons in the second wave of attack advance
by bounds from firing position to firing position and give
continuous support to the leading wave .
(1) Figure 118 shows diagrammatically a method of advance
and support. The arrows show the bounds made by
each tank in supporting the leading wave . The circled symbols
show firing positions taken by each tank .
(2) Tanks of the second wave must advance rapidly behind
the first wave. Some tanks must always be within supporting
distance. Crews of the tanks in position must be
37
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
extremely alert for targets . The tank cannot remain in .position
very long as it will become a very vulnerable target .
(3) Tanks emerging from the edge of woods or approaching
within 800 yards of a ridge must always be supported by
tanks in position .
(4) Tank platoons of the second wave may support the
leading wave by indirect fire methods when such methods
can give prompt support.
d. Tank platoons in the second wave of attack protect the
flanks and are ready to repel counterattacks,

FIGURE 119 .-A method of support of leading wave by indirect fire .
â¢ 38. SECOND ECHELON. a. The second echelon follows the
first echelon close enough so that the enemy will not have
time to reconstitute his antitank defense . This echelon, in
addition to its mission of destruction of hostile automatic
weapons and antitank guns passed over by the first echelon,
protects the flanks and repels counterattacks from the flanks .
b. Some platoons of the second echelon may be detailed
to support by fire the first echelon . In such operations, their
action is the same as the second wave of the leading echelon .
c. The infantry may attack with the second echelon . The
infantry attacks with the leading wave. The tanks do not

slow down to the pace of the infantry but keep on moving
fast. Succeeding waves pass through, the infantry .
0 39. THIRD ECHELON,-a. The third echelon of attack usually
attacks with the infantry and assists the infantry to advance .
The infantry may advance with the second echelon (see
par. 38) . This echelon will run away from the infantry
and the third echelon of tanks then takes over the task of
assisting the infantry.
b. The infantry may advance behind the second echelon of
attack in carriers until forced to dismount. When the infantry
is forced to dismount, the tanks first take position to
cover this action and then, assisted by the infantry, attack
the enemy resistance by fire and maneuver .
â 40. ATTACK WITH INFANTRY.-a. When the infantry attacks
first to secure ground from which a tank attack may be
launched, tanks when practicable take position to assist the
attack by fire . This assistance may be either by direct or
indirect fire . , Targets are machine guns and other automatic
weapons . Pill boxes or emplacements may be demolished
by armor piercing ammunition . The tank platoon
leader is assigned a sector in which to support the infantry .
He may be assigned targets or may fire on targets as they
disclose themselves,
b. When attacking through infantry in position, arrangements
are made with the infantry for a . passage of lines .
These arrangements include paths to be taken by the tanks
and means for infantrymen to identify themselves so they
will not be run down by the tanks . All members of the tank
crew must be particularly alert to prevent injury to their
own infantry.
c. When attacking with infantry, the following should be
observed when applicable :
(1) The platoon advances by fire and maneuver, one section
always covering the advance of the infantry and the
other section .
(2) The platoon joins in the fire fight only against dangerous
targets . Do not waste ammunition on hostile riflemen
at long range . The infantry supporting weapons will take
care of that .
1 3 8
(3) Be prepared to protect the infantry against a mechanized
attack .
(4) Destroy antitank guns immediately .
(5) If the platoon attacks ahead of the riflemen, hold the
ground gained until the riflemen close up .
(6) Keep close contact with the rifle unit commander .

0 41, TANK VERSUS TANK ACTION .-a. In tank versus tank
action, it is essential that tank crews be able to recognize readily
hostile tanks, that they know the capabilities of these tanks,
the vulnerable points at which to fire, and the capabilities of
their own and enemy tank weapons . In tank versus tank
action, every advantage must be taken of terrain, the sun,
direction of wind, weather, and your own weapons .
b . If outranged by hostile weapons the following may be
done:
(1) Move to concealed positions and send some tans to
the enemy flanks .
(2) Withdraw behind your own antitank gun defenses,
keeping out of range of the enemy weapons,
(3) Close on the enemy at maximum speed, attacking from
direction of the sun if practicable,
c. If your weapons out-range those of the enemy, close to
effective range of your weapons but keep out of range of the
enemy and halt to fire.
0 42. ATTACKING FORTIFICATIONS .Tanks avoid attacking fortifications
when possible. However, it may be necessary to
attack bunkers, pill boxes, and fixed gun emplacements in
order to effect a break-through, These fortifications are
attacked by small teams consisting of a tank platoon, an
infantry platoon;Â°and engineers, supported by artillery and
mortars, The method of attack will vary with the terrain,
the armament of the emplacement, and the wind direction .
a. Attacking machine-gun emplacements .-In attacking a
machine-gun emplacement, a section of tanks covered by the
remainder of the platoon rush the emplacement and destroy
it by crushing . If the emplacement cannot be destroyed by
crushing, infantry or engineers following the tanks destroy
the personnel by dropping a grenade in an opening or by
use of a flame thrower .
b. Destroying antitank gun emplacement .-In attacking an
antitank gun emplacement, methods must be varied according
to wind and terrain conditions,
(1) If wind conditions are favorable, that Is, from flank or
down range-
(a) Artillery and air bombardment destroy enemy artillery .

DEFENSE
i 43 . GENERAL .-Defensive action by armored units is covered
in FM 100-5 and FM 17-10. Tank plattons in defense are
used as counterattacking units . They are not used as armored
pill boxes .
â 44. PROCEDURE IN DEFENSE.--a . The tank platoon will be part
of a larger unit used as a counterattacking force . This force
makes limited objective attacks . The platoon functions as in
any other attack .
b, When in a defense position the tank platoon leader, his
tank commanders, and drivers make a thorough reconnaissance
of the ground over which they may attack ., Several
plans of attack may be given and the ground over which each
will take place must be thoroughly known . Some of this
reconnaissance must be made on foot . Landmarks must be
noted and complete plans made for the attack,
9 45. WITHDRAWAL,--a . The tank platoon, will usually be part
of a larger force. With this force it makes fast limited objective
attacks to disorganize the enemy and then rapidly withdraws
. In this action'the platoon may be used to give supporting
fires as in offensive action .
b . The platoon may also be used to cover road blocks . In
such action, tanks take position where they can cover by fire
the approaches to the road block and also be mutually supporting
in case the enemy sends dismounted men around the
block .

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
â¢ 2 . PURPOSE.-This manual is only a guide to the employment
of the tank company. The formations and actions
described herein are not inflexible . Each tactical situation
must be solved on its own merits and not by blind application
of a set of inflexible rules . Initiative of all commanders
must be encouraged,
â¢ 3. PRIOR TRAINING, Individual crew, section, and platoon
training should be completed before proceeding to company
training. The technique of operation of vehicles and
weapons and of the employment of the various weapons
should have been covered in earlier instructions. (See
sec . II .)
8 4. ORGANIZATION .-a. The tank company, both light and
medium, consists of a company headquarters and three
tank platoons of five tanks each .
b. Company headquarters .-(1) Company headquarters is
composed of a-
(a) Command section.
(b) Tank section.
(c) Communication-liaison-reconnaissance section .
(d) Maintenance section.
(e) Administrative and supply section .
(1) Mess section.
(2) On the march when combat is imminent and when
the company is in combat the administrative and supply
section and the mess section are with the battalion or higher
unit trains,
(3) The command section consists of the company commander
and various individuals mounted in a half-track
vehicle . During combat the company commander rides in
one of the tanks of company headquarters . The command
section half-track joins the maintenance officer .
(4) One tank of the tank section is used by the company
c'mmander. The other tank is used by the maintenance
officer who is also second-in-command of the company, This
tank is used as a replacement for the company commander's
or a platoon leader's tank .
(5) The communication-liaison-reconnaissance section is
equipped with a 1/4-ton truck. It is used on the march for

reconnaissance short distances to the sides and for liaison
with higher headquarters, especially when the company is
attached to another unit such as an infantry battalion . When
not used for liaison this section remains with the maintenance
officer and proceeds with him to the company rallying point .
Here the staff sergeant in charge makes such repairs and
adjustments on radio sets as time and means permit .
(6) The maintenance section is organized and equipped
to perform second echelon maintenance for the company .
It is equipped with a'/4-ton truck and two half-track vehicles .
During the march it follows at the tail of the company and
makes such repairs to vehicles as it can. Vehicles beyond
the capabilities of the section to repair are left with their
crews, for regimental or maintenance battalion personnel .
During combat the section accompanies the company to the
attack position where it assists in making last minute repairs .
It follows the attack as closely as practicable, along an axis
of maintenance prescribed by the company commander, to
repair tanks that are out of action .
(7) The maintenance officer, second-in-command of the
company, commands the maintenance section and supervises
all maintenance in the company. He accompanies the company
to the attack position. After the attack starts he
assumes charge of all vehicles left at the attack position, that
is, the maintenance vehicles, the second company headquarters
tank, and the communication-liaison-reconnaissance
'/4-ton truck . He moves these vehicles forward, following
the company as closely as practicable, makes repairs on damaged
tanks, makes estimates of material needed to repair
those beyond the capabilities of his section to repair, transmits
this information with the exact locations of the disabled
vehicles to the regimental maintenance platoon, and rejoins
the company at the rallying point .
15, CHARACTERISTICS,--a, The tank is characterized by great
mobility, fire power, armor protection, and shock action .
These characteristics are possessed in varying degrees by
different types of tanks . The characteristics dictate the
manner of employment.

THE TANK COMPANY, LIGHT AND MEDIUM
5-7
b . Light tanks, as compared to medium tanks, have less
fire power, lighter armor, and greater speed and maneuverability
. They are particularly fitted for-
(1) Feeling out the enemy and developing the weak spots
in the enemy position through which medium tanks may
attack,
(2) Screening the advance against light enemy resistance .
(3) Leading an attack against an unarmored enemy weak
in antitank defense, when speed is essential .
(4) A fast maneuvering force to exploit the success of
medium tanks.
(5) Maneuver to the flank or rear to strike the enemy
command posts, communication centers, and other vital
installations,
(6) Pursuing a defeated enemy,
c . Medium tanks, because of their greater fire power, guns
of heavier caliber, greater armor protection, and shocking
power are used to-
(1) Lead an attack against an enemy whose position and
strength is known .
(2) .'Support by fire the attack of either light or other
medium tanks.
16. OPERATION,-a. The tank company is normally employed
as part of the tank battalion, It may, however, be used as
advance, flank, and rear guard and on separate missions .
b . The reinforcement of the tank company will be normal .
Such reinforcements will vary from a mortar and an assault
gun from the battalion headquarters company to one or more
infantry platoons, engineers, artillery, and reconnaissance
elements. A light tank company may have a medium tank
platoon attached to or supporting it for certain operations .
17. FUNDAMENTALS.-a. Surprise .-Surprise is obtained by
striking the enemy at an unexpected time, from an unexpected
direction, and in sufficient numbers to gain the objective.
Speed of movement and the use of covered approaches
assist in gaining surprise . Seek to surprise your enemy but
do not let yourself be surprised . Give your enemy credit for
as much tactical knowledge as you have or more . Do not
7

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
underestimate him . Expect the unexpected and be prepared
for it .
b. Fire and maneuver,-The company advances by fire and
movement. A portion of the command maneuvers against
the enemy while the remainder covers that movement . This
covering force does not necessarily fire all the time while the
other force is maneuvering . It takes up positions where it
can bring effective fire on any enemy holding up the advance .
It fires only when necessary to assist the advance . After the
maneuvering force has advanced beyond supporting distance
of the covering force, it may take positions and become the
covering force while the former covering force become",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESERVES
â 476 The initial strength and location of the reserve will
vary with its contemplated missions the type of maneuver
possible hostile reaction and clarity of the situation After
the attack is launched the reserve and the fires of supporting
arms are the principal means available to the commander for
shaping the course of action and for enforcing favorable
decision
The primary mission of the reserve is to enter the action
offensively at the proper place and moment to clinch the
victory Hence its initial strength and location are Controlled
largely by the maneuver to be executed
2 477 In a penetration the reserve must be large enough to
exploit the break-through by enveloping one or both of the
flanks created and by operating deep in the hostile rear
To facilitate its rapid movement through the gap the reserve
is located generally in rear of the main attack
â¢ 478 In an envelopment the reserve must be large enough
to extend the envelopment or to exploit a successful enveloping
action by operating against the hostile rear To favor
the envelopment the reserve is disposed toward the flank
enveloped
â¢ 479 When open flanks exist or when there is' danger of a
hostile threat some reserves are disposed to meet dangerous
contingencies
0 480 When the situation is relatively clear and enemy capabilities
are limited the reserve may consist of a small fraction
04
situation is obscure the reserve may consist initially of the
bulk of the command centrally located and prepared to
move to any point on the front or flanks
â¢ 48 The location of the reserve should combine a maximum
of protection for itself against hostile observation and air
and mechanized attack with a road net which facilitates rapid
movement to any point of possible employment Motor vehicles
should be held available for the movement of reserves
lacking organic means of rapid movement
â¢ 482 Choosing the proper time at which the reserve should
be used is often the commander's most difficult and most
important decision
Nevertheless at the decisive moment of action every man
that can be used to advantage must participate in the battle
and the reserve must be launched without hesitation As far
as practicable the reserve is sent in by complete units Reinforcement
by driblets is avoided Commanders endeavor
to reconstitute reserves from troops which the course of the
action has made available
COORDINATION
â¢
483 The commander is responsible for coordination of the
action of all elements of his command
â¢ 484 In all cases the highest degree of coordination permitted
by the situation and time element is sought The
considerations discussed below are applicable in general to
situations in which thorough coordination can be prescribed
In other situations they are applied to the degree practicable
0 485 Against a strong enemy a decision to develop and deploy
for attack directly from march columns risks loss of
control and sacrifices some of the capabilities of artillery
tanks and other supporting weapons Ordinarily an attack
in a moving situation may be organized and coordinated in
assembly positions
â¢ 486 From a march formation the commander develops
the main body for a coordinated attack by assigning march
objectives to the larger units usually the assembly positions
they are to occupy and routes or zones of advance thereto
The development order announces the missions of units

already engaged the missions of the artillery the dispositions
of the main body the security measures to be taken and instructions
for further reconnaissance It provides for essential
administrative details so that the necessary preparations
can be made Instructions given in the development order are
as complete as possible so that the attack order may be brief
For movement to assembly positions and security during
development see paragraphs 364-369 and 436-438
0 487 The location of assembly positions is dependent on
several factors Darkness cover from observed hostile artillery
fire a thorough knowledge of the situation and a plan
of attack already decided favor advanced positions located
in conformity with the plan of maneuver Conditions the
reverse of these indicate the selection of assembly positions
well back
Units of high mobility such as tanks cavalry and armored
forces may complete their development and preparations
for battle at greater distances from the hostile front
If the plan of attack involves an enveloping maneuver the
assembly position of the enveloping force is set off at a sufficient
interval from the troops in the secondary attack to
preclude interference between units when deployed for attack
0 488 Subordinate commanders assigned assembly positions
may in turn assign more advanced assembly positions to the
component units of their commands as knowledge of the
situation and of plans becomes available The final assembly
position of an infantry battalion in the attack echelon usually
is in the most forward concealed position available in rear
of the line of departure It should afford cover from hostile
small-arms fire
8 489 While units are moving into and during the occupation
of their assembly positions the commander prepares his
orders and completes arrangements for the execution of his
plan of maneuver
Commanders of troops in the attack echelon and the
commanders of units designated to support them coordinate
the action of their units Reconnaissance is initiated by all
commanders prior to arrival in their final assembly positions
It 490 As each unit arrives in its assembly position measures
are taken immediately for security and for clearing the roads
06
Signal communication is established without delay between
the superior command post and the major subordinate units
Equipment not essential to combat is disposed of extra ammunition
is issued to troops reconnaissances are completed
coordination of the plans of maneuver and plans of fire of
subordinate units is completed and attack orders are issued
promptly
â¢ 49 Development of the command terminates with the
troops distributed in accordance with the plan for their
employment and in an approach march formation favoring
rapid deployment
â¢ 492 Should the commander decide that rapidity of action
is essential to retain a tactical advantage he may dispense
with assembly positions decentralize operations to combat
teams or task forces and issue orders to those units to develop
and attack
Y 493 Subordinate units to be deployed for attack ordinarily
are assigned a zone of action and a direction of attack or an
objective Zones of action regulate the limits for battle
reconnaissance and combat of the unit It is not necessary
that troop formations extend across the entire zone of action
of a unit as part of the zone of action can often be covered by
fire by small patrols or by both A preponderance of force
on any particular part of the front is obtained by varying
the zones of action of subordinate units
Zones of action are defined by designating their lateral
boundaries or by the assignment of a front of deployment and
the designation of the lateral limits of the objective An
open flank ordinarily is not bounded In some situations the
designation of the Objective is sufficient to indicate the zone
of action In large units the designation of objectives and
boundaries may be made from the map ; in small units these
designations are made on the ground Points designated
should be identified easily on the ground
Zones of action should extend through the depth of the
hostile position at least as far as the location of the hostile
artillery Important localities and terrain corridors commensurate
with the*size of a tactical unit should lie wholly
within the zone of action of that unit If it is desired that an
adjacent unit render special assistance to another in the

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
attack this assistance should be clearly stated During the
progress of combat and especially when reserves are committed
to action appropriate changes in zones of action are
made
To take advantage of favorable routes of approach units
may move temporarily into adjacent zones Such movement
must not interfere with the action of adjacent units or result
in a dangerous massing of troops The emplacement and
movement of artillery and other supporting weapons in zones
of action adjacent to the zone of the units they support are
permissible but must be carefully coordinated (See par 538 )
The battalion is ordinarily the smallest unit which is
assigned a zone of action Smaller units are usually assigned
directions and objectives
When lateral boundaries are not clearly defined they are
supplemented by assigning compass directions of attack
This is particularly important in small units
When tactical groupings are separated initially by wide
intervals and the direction of their subsequent maneuvers
cannot be foreseen designation of a boundary between them
may be withheld until a later phase of the action In such
situations it frequently will be necessary to establish a limiting
line between them for coordination and control of their
supporting fires
â¢ 494 A line of departure usually is designated from which
the attacking troops are launched at the prescribed hour or
separate lines of departure and hours are assigned to the
several attacking units The purpose of the line of departure
is to coordinate the advance of the attack echelon so that its
elements will strike the enemy in the order and at the time
desired This line should be recognized easily on the ground
and should be approximately perpendicular to the direction
of attack
â¢ 495 The time of attack is the hour at which the attack is
to be launched If a line of departure is prescribed it is the
hour at which the line is to be crossed by the leading elements
of the attack It is determined by the time required for
commanders to make the necessary reconnaissance prepare
plans and issue orders : for the cooperating arms to coordinate
their plans; and for the attack echelon tq organize its
attack and move to position
08
OPERATIONS
495-499
The secondary attack may precede the main attack to force
the enemy to commit the greatest possible portion of his forces
against that attack or the main and secondary attacks may
be launched simultaneously
Unity of effort is promoted by assigning subordinate units
objectives which insure mutual support and by prescribing
where and in what direction subordinate units are to make
their main effort The combat action and direction of attack
taken by subordinate commanders must be such as to build
up the main effort of the tactical grouping in accordance with
the intentions of the superior commander
The commander must endeavor constantly to prevent the
attack from breaking up into a series of uncoordinated
combats
â¢ 496 The degree of surprise attained is dependent in a large
measure on the coordination and timing of the measures
taken to deceive the enemy Ruses demonstrations feints
and other measures for deception executed at the wrong time
and place will be obvious to an alert enemy and will warn
him of the impending attack Superior mobility and speed
of execution may be determining factors in achieving
surprise
â¢ 497 The best guarantee for success in the attack is effective
cooperation between the troops in the attack echelon
the supporting artillery and any supporting combat aviation
The superior commander coordinates the fire support of his
artillery with the plan of maneuver of the attacking troops
Acting through the commander of supporting combat aviation
he coordinates the fire support of the combat aviation
with the fire of his artillery his plan of maneuver and his
plan of employment of mechanized units
â¢ 498 To assure close cooperation with the attacking troops
artillery units assigned to direct support of designated units
maintain constant connection with supported units through
common command posts or by liaison' agents Ordinarily an
artillery battalion is placed in direct support of an infantry
regiment or a cavalry brigade Cooperation is facilitated by
habitually associating the same units on the march and in
combat

of the senior artillery commander of a smaller force of
combined arms
Subordinate artillery commanders establish their command
posts where they can exercise tactical command and
fire direction most effectively If an artillery commander
locates his command post at a place other than the command
post of the supported unit he establishes liaison and
maintains signal communication with the commander of the
supported unit
â¢ 500 The commander of the supported unit informs the
supporting artillery commander of the situation his plan of
attack and the artillery support desired The supporting
artillery commander informs the commander of the unit of
the number and general location of his batteries the present
location of the artillery observation posts and those that must
be seized during the advance the terrain which the artillery
commands with observation and fire and the means by which
the artillery can most effectively support the attack (See
par 528 )
Based on this exchange of information the associated commanders
arrange the plan of fire support to be given by the
artillery during the attack
The artillery commander must comply with the requests of
the supported unit commander to the limit of his capabilities
subject only to orders received from higher authority If he
receives a fire mission which conflicts with the needs of the
supported troops he reports the situation to the commander
ordering the mission and then complies with the resulting
decision If the urgency of the situation precludes this report
the artillery commander acts on his own initiative in accordance
with his knowledge of the situation reporting his action
to his superior at the first opportunity
As a rule a liaison section is assigned to each infantry battalion
or cavalry regiment A mutual obligation rests upon
the commanders of supported and supporting units that
liaison once established is maintained It is essential that the
supporting artillery know at all times the location of the leading
elements of the attack echelon and be kept informed of
the plans of the supported unit
â¢
50 The fire of other supporting weapons is coordinated

ments the artillery fire of direct support chiefly by engaging
targets in the immediate foreground whose neutralization by
artillery might endanger the attack echelon and targets
within range on which artillery fire cannot be placed
â¢ 502 The action of combat aviation in support of ground
troops is closely coordinated with the plan of attack Its
first objectives are those hostile elements the destruction or
neutralization of which will contribute most toward a successful
attack During battle combat aviation is especially
useful as a means immediately available to a commander
to exploit a success to correct an adverse situation to attack
reserves or reinforcements or to support ground troops in
overcoming unexpected resistance Its employment to complement
the fire of artillery in a crisis or in fast moving situations
is habitu especially in attacks by tanks and armored
forces
â¢ 503 To assure effective cooperation supporting combat
aviation should operate from landing fields within short
flying time of the zone of action and must be included in the
air-ground radio net and wire net of supported units To
facilitate coordination of its effort with that of the ground
troops a liaison officer from supporting combat aviation
should be with the supported unit Supported ground troops
must keep supporting combat aviation informed of the location
of leading elements and of plans of maneuver and fire
It is especially important that adequate means of identification
of friendly ground troops be carefully arranged and
coordinated
â¢ 504 An integration of the attack into a unified whole requires
complete coordination and cooperation prior to and
during the operation between supporting tanks artillery
and combat aviation (See chs 2 and 6 )
H 505 Because of the difficulty of establishing and maintaining
effective chemical concentrations in mobile operations
use by the attacker of chemical agents other than smoke is
limited Smoke must be carefully employed in respect to
both time and space and must be closely coordinated with
other supporting fires and with the action of tanks and supporting
aviation Under favorable conditions of wind and
weather smoke is used to blind hostile observation posts antitank
guns and infantry supporting weapons to conceal the

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
approach of the attack echelon and to protect the flanks of
the attack It is especially useful during shortt periods when
troops must cross exposed ground
506 As soon' as the commander has made his decision he
completes his plan of attack and issues his attack order
wherein he prescribes the necessary coordination for the
action (See FM 0 -5 )
507 When conditions limit the ability of the commander to
exercise a timely and direct influence on the action the initiative
of subordinates must be relied upon to a great extent
The commander issues less detailed orders to those tactical
groupings over whose action he can not exercise a direct influence
and attaches to them the means necessary to accomplish
their tasks He remains with and personally directs
the action of the troops whose mission is of decisive importance
to the action This method of conducting an operation
is most prevalent in pursuits in opening phases of a meeting
engagement during crises of battle and in envelopments in
which the main and secondary attacks are separated by wide
intervals The greatest degree of coordination possible is
prescribed initially; complete coordination is accomplished
as soon as the course of action permits (See par 25 )
0 508 Coordination is assured by command and staff visits
to subordinates to see that orders are understood and are being
carried out
SECTION II
ATTACK IN WAR OF MOVEMENT
509 A meeting engagement is a collision between two opposing
forces more or less unprepared for battle Ordinarily
the collision is caused by uncertainty or obscurity in the situation
This aspect is often present in the operations of
small units and in situations where the means of reconnaissance
have failed or are unable to operate
A meeting engagement may ensue when each opponent is
cognizant of the other; yet both decide to attack without
delay to retain some tactical advantage to gain a decisive
terrain feature or from a feeling of superiority It may
occur when one opponent decides to deploy hastily for defense
while the other attacks' before this defense can be
organized
2
OPERATIONS
5 0-5 4
5 0 In open warfare immediate orders and rapid action
axe essential By the prompt exercise of initiative endeavor
must be made to deprive the enemy of his freedom of action
and prevent the coordinated employment of his forces A
great advantage accrues to the force which first succeeds in
making effective preparations Action cannot be delayed
awaiting the results of detailed reconnaissances Prompt estimate
of the situation quick decision and prompt attack are
essential to success
The tactical situation which develops on first contact has a
strong influence on the subsequent course of action Commanders
must be well forward when the enemy is engaged ;
otherwise units may be employed improperly
Opportunities for decisive action must be exploited immediately
The rapidity of modern combat frequently makes
the time element decisive
8 5 Open warfare requires the widest possible exercise of
initiative by commanders of all echelons in the execution of
the general mission assigned to the command
Information gained by reconnaissance agencies during the
advance affords a basis for the commander's preliminary disposition
and may enable him to determine the general line
of engagement with the enemy and the plan of attack As
a rule however the enemy's intentions will remain obscure
and will seldom be clarified until after the initial engagement
â¢ 5 2 As soon as the prospect of an engagement becomes
apparent the superior commander initiates plans for the
operation and disposes his command to facilitate its rapid
entry into action One or more advance message centers are
established to facilitate prompt signal communication
Early and rapid transmission of orders to elements of the
main body is essential to an orderly and timely employment
of the command and may be vital particularly in columns of
high mobility
â¢ 5 3 Initial orders are ordinarily issued in fragmentary
form to the various elements of the command The sequence
in which orders are issued is based upon the priority of and
the time required for execution
â¢ 5 4 When timely information of the enemy is lacking
subordinate commanders are relied upon to exercise their
initiative and make important decisions in consonance with
3
5 4-5 7
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
the general mission and the intentions of the superior commander
Without delay the superior commander coordinates
the action which his subordinates have initiated (See
par 507 )
â 5 5 Employment of the advance guard is the commander's
first problem and is the basis for the employment of the
remainder of the main body When contact is imminent or
when entering the zone of effective hostile artillery fire the
advance guard moves forward on a broad front When hostile
resistance is encountered the advance guard must secure
possession of terrain that will afford good observation for
the artillery and other supporting weapons and gain the
time and space required for the development and deployment
of the main body These missions require aggressive action
against the enemy's leading troops Unfavorable terrain or
an encounter with superior hostile forces may make a temporary
defense or a limited retirement advisable to preserve
the commander's freedom of action However all advanceguard
actions are characterized by speed and aggressiveness
by broad fronts and by small or no reserves
The advance guard performs its mission most effectively
when after securing possession of the essential terrain features
it is disposed to protect the deployment of the main body Its
artillery deploys on a broad front opens long-range fire on
enemy columns forcing them to an early deployment and
interdicts the principal routes of approach
The advance guard is strongly reinforced by artillery from
the main body and by supporting combat aviation It is
reinforced with other elements of the main body only when
the situation clearly demands it
5 6 Cavalry after withdrawal from the front of advanceguard
infantry may be employed on the flanks to screen our
own dispositions to execute reconnaissance or harassing
action against the hostile flanks and rear or may be held
in reserve
5 7 The speed of modern offensive operations demands
that supporting artillery be prepared to react immediately
with fire when opportune targets are presented To do this
artillery observation and positions must be as far forward
as possible
Early entry into action of the bulk of the artillery with the
4
OPERATIONS
5 7-520
main body is essential to protect the development to give
support and cohesion to the advance-guard action and to
gain an early superiority over the hostile artillery
It may be necessary for a portion of the artillery to occupy
temporary firing positions to Insure that troops do not come
under hostile fire without artillery protection
â¢ 5 8 The artillery preferably is deployed initially so that
it can protect the development and support the attack from
the same position areas 'When initial positions are too distant
the artillery in direct support must so displace forward
as to assure close support of the attack echelon
While other troops are organizing their attack the artillery
completes preparation of firing data and arrangements
for supporting the attack Observation aviation is placed
at the disposal of the artillery commander in order that
the hostile artillery and large troop assemblies may be located
and fire conducted on important targets at long range
â¢ 5 9 In accordance with his estimate of the situation the
commander develops the main body and organizes a coordinated
attack or attacks directly from march columns
with a part of his command and organizes a more coordinated
attack with the remainder or attacks with his whole force
from march columns as units become available (See pars
485-487 492 and 507 )
â¢ 520 Regardless of whether the attack is launched from
assembly positions or directly from march columns the
method of approach to the hostile position is the same
Each battalion of the attack echelon moves to the most advanced
position In which it can make its final preparations
under cover from hostile small-arms fire
The commander of each attack unit directs its advance
in the assigned zone of action so as to be able to cross the
line of departure at the prescribed hour Each attack unit
reconnoiters its zone of action and supports the reconnaissance
elements with Its supporting weapons To keep troops
in hand prior to contact with the hostile forces a base unit
is usually designated on which the other units regulate their
advance from one terrain line to the next Terrain features
which afford extended observation or which are otherwise
of tactical importance are the objectives of each bound
5

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â¢ 52 Whether an offensive battle is the result of a meeting
engagement or is based on the attack of an organized position
the conduct of the attack from the time the enemy is
engaged until he is defeated is essentially the same What
difference there is exists in the coordination power and
speed developed in the opening phases (See pars 535-572 )
SECTION III
ATTACK OF AN ORGANIZED POSITION
PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS
â¢ 522 Ordinarily the defender will attempt to screen his
main position and deceive the attacker regarding his dispositions
by the employment of covering forces A thorough
reconnaissance of the hostile position and its foreground is of
primary importance This reconnaissance seeks to determine
the location depth and extension of the hostile position
the hostile occupation of the position contaminated areas the
location of the hostile artillery and natural and artificial tank
obstacles It involves a thorough study of the map and air
photographs of the enemy's combat zone and the use of
available air and ground reconnaissance agencies
â¢ 523 If air reconnaissance and advance detachments fail to
establish definitely the main hostile position the leading
troops are reinforced strongly by artillery combat aviation
other supporting weapons and if necessary by tanks Rifle
reinforcements are held to a minimum The reinforced leading
troops execute a reconnaissance in force against critical
points in the enemy's outpost zone to drive in the enemy's
covering forces and determine the hostile main position
Their mission is to seize the terrain which will permit the
proper deployment of the command and permit observation
of the hostile battle position
When the leading troops finally encounter a well-organized
system of defensive fires of hostile artillery and other supporting
weapons it may be taken as a reliable indication that
the hostile battle position has been reached The leading
troops establish themselves on the critical points and cover
the deployment of the mass of the artillery

troops seek to locate the flanks of the hostile position The

OPERATIONS
524-527
leading elements are protected from hostile counterattack by
strong supporting fires and by the presence of other units
moved to concealed positions within supporting distance The
remainder of the command is held in readiness beyond the
range of effective hostile artillery fire Necessary measures
are taken to protect it against air attack and attack by
mechanized units
â¢ 525 Reconnaissance is continued to obtain information as
a basis for the conduct of the attack This reconnaissance
provides more detailed information for the assignment of
objectives and as a basis for the plan of fire of the artillery
and the other supporting weapons
Reconnaissance of the terrain must determine the most
favorable routes of approach to the hostile position the
nature and strength of obstacles and the possibilities for
employment of mechanized units
Air photographs of the hostile main position are distributed
to subordinate commanders
The terrain over which the attack must pass is studied on
the ground and from air photographs to determine the terrain
compartments which the defender has organized for
defense and can cover with defensive fires and the areas in
which the attacker can advance best by flanking fire and
maneuver
Artillery conducts reconnaissance to determine the possibilities
of artillery observation and fire and the location of
its firing positions and the routes of approach thereto
â¢ 526 Determination of the weak points in the enemy dispositions
is of vital importance By fire of artillery and other
supporting weapons delivered from different directions and
by feints and raids effort is made to ascertain the enemy's
dispositions and his plan of defensive fires
PREPARATIONS FOR ATTACK
527 Based on the estimate of the situation the main attack
is made either as an envelopment or a penetration A carefully
coordinated attack is required Orders are issued for
the preparations for the attack and for the measures for
secrecy and deception to be adopted
Preparations for the attack include the completio",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
to final assemblypositions preparatory to an attack the next morning Move-ment of units into their assembly positions by day generallyis practicable only when visibility is poor or when overwhelming artillery and combat aviation support is availableWhen tanks are employed their assembly positions androutes of approach are reconnoitered marked and prepared530 The first mission of the artillery is to protect themovement into and the assembly positions of attack unitsDuring this phase hostile artillery and observation posts constitute its principal targets Registration fires should beconducted so as not to disclose the impending attack Theartillery gives special consideration to those measures whichwill attain surprise in the opening of effective fire gain firesuperiority over the hostile artillery and concentrate themass of its fire on the decisive objectives0 53 Artillery positions are selected so that fire can be concentrated on the objectives of the attack Defilade concealment from air reconnaissance and proximity to observationare sought Sufficient time is allowed for the preparation offiring data establishment of signal communication and organization of the artillery ammunition supplyArtillery usually moves into position by echelonThemovement is frequently wholly or partly executed at nightUnits assigned to positions screened from hostile air reconnaissance are moved first The movement of artillery isregulated to avoid interfering with the attack echelon in itsoccupation of final assembly positions Long-range artilleryis placed well forward to be able to take under fire the mostdistant echelons of the defender's light and medium artillery0 532 During the advance of the attack echelon from assembly positions the hostile artillery constitutes the principaltarget of our artillery fire Superiority over the hostile artillery is indispensable for the success of the attack Itrarely can be attained after the attack is launchedLocated hostile batteries are silenced early in the artilleryaction Their neutralization then is maintained by a portionof the artillery in order that the mass may be employed onother missions until again required for counterbattery fire asnew hostile batteries are located If counterbattery fire isunable to gain superiority over the hostile artillery neutralization of the hostile observation just prior to the attackis of great importance98,533-535FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS533 Artillery fires prior to the hour of attack may be limited to normal fires already in progress or the attack maybe preceded by an artillery preparationThe duration of the preparation varies with the situationA prolonged preparation is destructive of surprise and givesthe enemy time to take countermeasures The length of thepreparation is influenced also by the extent to which tanksare to participate in the attack and the role assigned tothem The duration of the artillery preparation may varyfrom 5 minutes to several hoursThe nature of the artillery preparation depends upon itsmission Concentration of effect is greatly favored by dividing the preparation into phasesThe object of the first phase of the preparation is to neutralize the defender's artillery destroy the most importanthostile agencies of command and fire control isolate thedefender's forces from the rear disrupt assembled hostilemechanized forces and protect our troops from the enemy'scounterpreparation firesArtillery fire of the first phasecomprises counterbattery fire , destruction fire on commandposts observation posts and signal communication Installations , interdiction and destruction fire on enemy routes ofcommunication , destruction fire on mine fields and hostileobstacles , and concentrations on the hostile defense areasand assembled mechanized unitsIn the subsequent phase of the preparation sufficient artillery continues counterbattery fire to maintain neutralizationof the hostile artillery The fire of the mass of the remaining artillery is concentrated on the hostile defense areas 534 During the preparation other supporting weaponsfire on sensitive points in the advanced zone of resistanceSupporting bombardment aviation is concentrated againsthostile artillery signal communication centers and reserveswith particular attention to mechanized units which cannotbe covered effectively by artillery During the last few minutes of the preparation bombardment aviation, is concentrated upon the hostile defense areasCONDUCT OF THE ATTACK 535 The attack is characterized by the positive action offire and movement combined and controlled to create a preponderance of force in the decisive direction20OPERATIONS536-538 536 The attacking echelon advances from its final assembly positions so as to cross the line of departure at theprescribed time Any mass formation of units runs graverisks of incurring heavy losses from hostile counterpreparation fires and air attack The leading echelon is thereforethin initially , its fire power is gradually built up as theenemy discloses his plan of defenseWhen fire superiority has been gained the leading echeloncloses to assaulting distance 537 Superiority of fire rests chiefly upon the mutual support of units in the attacking echelon and the coordinationof their action with the fire support of artillery bombardmentaviation and supporting tanks It depends not only on volume of fire but also on its direction and accuracyFire effect is increased by enfilade action Flanking oroblique fire is especially effective when frontal fire is deliveredsimultaneously against the same objective A convergent fireforces the enemy to defend himself against attack from several directions and creates a powerful moral as well as material effectUnits seek to gain flanking fire by enveloping actionFlanking fire is also secured through the lateral echelonmentof supporting weapons with respect to the units they supportHeavy machine guns from positions in adjacent zones ofaction deliver oblique fire over the troops in their front andprotect the flanks of troops in the attack echelon Lightmachine guns of rifle units follow the leading elementsclosely in order to take advantage of and deliver flanking firethrough the gaps along the front Units which have succeeded in gaining advanced positions deliver flanking fireacross the front of adjacent rearward unitsLateral echelonment of artillery for purposes of flankingfire increases the difficulties of fire control and of liaison between the artillery and supported units The fire of supporting artillery is more reliable and effective when its positionsand observation posts are in the zone of action of the supported unit538 The attacking echelon advances to assaulting distance of the hostile position under its own and supportingfires Until the main hostile resistance is broken attackunits advance by bounds to successive terrain lines on each2,,,538-542FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONSof which the fire support for the next bound is organizedFire and movement are alternated in such manner that anattack unit whose advance is made possible by the combinedfire of adjacent and supporting units moves forward to anadvanced position and by its fire from that position assists theadvance of the adjacent units 539 Troops transported by air may be employed to seizehold or destroy objectives which contribute directly to thesuccess of the main attack 540 Artillery and other supporting weapons insure continuity of support by displacing forward in groups (byechelon) while the bulk remains in position and maintainsfire Fire is lifted successively to more distant targets as theattacking echelon becomes endangered by it When supporting artillery heavy machine-gun and mortar fires are liftedfrom the hostile position to permit the attacking echelon toclose with the enemy the loss of this support must be compensated for by the increased fire of the lighter weapons andby the cooperative action of tanks (See ch 6 )Artillery supports the attack through the depth of thehostile position by successive concentrations in accordancewith the requests of the supported commanders Concentrations of artillery fire are regulated to bring the greatest possible volume of fire on objectives of decisive importance at thecritical moments of the attack Attack units take immediateadvantage of artillery fire effect to gain ground to the frontThe artillery is prepared for early movement forward to mainEssential firetain close support as the attack progressesmissions of units being displaced are distributed to units inposition 54 542 Artillery must employ all means at its disposal (observers liaison sections airplanes wire and radio communication to attack units) to obtain exact information of the loca,tion of the front line The attacking units must cooperateby employing all means of transmitting information to theartillery (display of panels pyrotechnics and various othermeans of signal communication) When uncertain as to thelocation of the attack echelon direct support artillery takesimmediate steps to establish close contacts with thoseelements22OPERATIONS543-548 543 During the attack the supporting fires are concentrated against the fronts where the attacking echelon ismaking the greatest progress Artillery fires are supplementedby fires of other supporting weaponsThe fire of theseweapons is used to increase the density of the artillery fireor is placed on those areas and targets which can not beeffectively engaged by the artillery When the attack echelonarrives close to the hostile position the fire of all artilleryincluding that in general support is concentrated on rearward hostile defense areas 544 The primary purpose of close supporting fire is toprevent the enemy from manning his defensive works in timeto meet the assault Its progression to successive objectives isarranged between supporting and supported commandersIt may be regulated by a time schedule based upon the probablerate of advance of the attacking troops by signal given byassaulting troops or by a time schedule based upon a desirableduration of the fireOther fire is placed on critical points in the hostile positionto protect the attack echelon from hostile long-range andflanking fires and from counterattackIt is lifted to correspond with the advance of the attacking echelon 545 Each attack unit uses the close supporting fires of itsartillery and other supporting weapons to close with theenemy and to push on to its successive objectives withoutdeviating from the prescribed general direction of attack 546 Combat aviation supports the attack through the depthof the hostile position Commanders of the supporting aviation thoroughly familiarize themselves with the terrain in thezone of the attack Supporting combat aviation is concentrated over that part of the hostile front where the attackseeks decisive results Its operations are coordinated to provide the maximum support at the time the ground forceslaunch the attack 547 The attack must not permit its advance to be long arrested by hostile chemical

proportion of the close-combat elementsof the command are assembled concealed in a position favoring the execution of the contemplated counteroffensive 575 Conduct of the defense conforms to the doctrine discussed in section II chapter 0As soon as the purpose of the initial defense has been accomplished the counteroffensive is launched Thereafterthe conduct of the action is that of the attack30576-579576 A defending force frequently has an opportunity toadopt the offensiveWhen a general counterattack launchedby the defender throws the attacker back following an apparently successful advance or when a hostile attack breaksdown in front of the main line of resistance the enemy seldom will be able to withstand a determined counteroffensiveThe enemy artillery fire still may be superior but his attacking echelon will be disorganized and signal communicationin his forward area will be disruptedIf the defender seizesthe initiative and passes to an offensive before the

OF ORDNANCE
The 37 mm guns are the lightest weapons
of the field-gun type used in the
U.S. Army. The original 37 mm gun supplied
to the U .S . Army in 1917-18 was
the M1916, of French design . It was a
comparatively low-velocity weapon not
suited for antitank employment .
The 37 mm Gun, M1916, is classified as
Limited Standard for manufacture, but
as Standard for issue, with its cradle,
as subcaliber equipment . The Carriages,
M1916, M1916A1 and M1916A2 are also
Limited Standard.
The desirability of a light, highly mobile
antitank gun, using armor-piercing
and high-explosive shells, resulted in the
production of the 37 mm antitank
materiel whose design features closely resemble
the German Rheinmetall weapon .
The 37 mm Antitank Gun, M3, represents
the most powerful piece that has
been manufactured to weigh less than
1,000 pounds . Recent developments in
ammunition have increased the muzzle
velocity from 2,600 feet per second to
2,900 feet per second, with consequently
greater armor penetration .

GUN, M3--'l'he rifle(! barrel is a 011(1-
piece forging threaded to screw into aa
breech ring recessed for a vertically sliding
block which is operated manually . The
recoil system is of the hydrospring type,
including a buffer mechanism which prevents
possible damage to the weapon due
to sudden stopping of the recoiling parts .
The estimated life of the gun at normal
pressure is approximately 2,500 rounds .
GUN, M3AI-Addition of gas deflectors
to the M3 gun changed its designation
to M3A1 . These gas deflectors
were subsequently removed, but all 37
mm, M3, guns with muzzles threaded for
gas deflectors are now designated M3A1 .
CARRIAGE, M4-This carriage has a
split trail and pneumatic tires . It can be
towed by a prime mover on roads or across
country, and by its crew. Elevating and
traversing mechanisms are attached to
the mount. Adjustments in traverse are
normally made by the use of the traversing
handwheel, although a traversing release
handle allows rapid changes in
traverse through free movement of the
gun. The handle must be held in position
during free traverse, for on release of the
handle the gun is automatically locked to
the traversing mechanism.
37 MM ANTITANK GUN M3A1--CARRIAGE M4A1 (Continued)
In order to increase stability of the gun
during firing, wheel segments which swing
on the axle raise the tires off the ground .
The segments are locked in both travel
and firing positions by a handle-actuated
plunger .
The Telescope, M6, is held in position
by the Telescope Mount, M19, which is
attached to the gun carriage by means of
a bracket, assuring movement of the sight
with the gun during traverse .
While a 37 mm gun squad consists of
six men, the Carriage, M4, is designed for
one-man control of aiming, elevating,
traversing and firing .
Carriage, M4, is classified as Limited
Standard .
CARRIAGE, M4AI-This carriage is
identical with the Carriage, M4, except
that for quick adjustment of the gun in
traverse a release mechanism permits traverse
to be effected by pressure of the
right shoulder and arm against the shoulder
traversing bar so long as the traversing
release handle is locked to the rear .
With the traversing release handle in its
forward position, the gun may be traversed
by use of a traversing knob .
The classification of this carriage is
Standard.

57 mm ANTITANK GUN, MI, ON CARRIAGE, M1, IN FIRING POSITION ; CARRIAGE, MIA3, IS CARRIAGE, M1, WITH MINOR MODIFICATIONS
British battle experience indicated the
need for a light gun more powerful
than the 2-pounder (37 mm) which could
be employed as an antitank weapon or
be mounted in a tank or gun motor carriage.
This requirement was met by the
6-pounder gun, standardized in America
for Lend-Lease manufacture as the 57
mm Gun, Ml .
O.C.M: . 16489, dated 20 February
1941, authorized the preparation of drawings
of the British 6-pounder gun, carriage
and on-carriage fire control equipment
converted to American gears, threads and
tolerances. On 15 May 1941, O .C.M.
16722 recommended standardization of
the British-American 57 mm materiel as
Gun, M1, Carriage, M1, Telescope, M18,
and Telescope Mount, M24 .
Modifications were made to the M1
Carriage which culminated in the present
Carriage, M1A3. These changes included
substitution of free traverse for gear
traverse, and new lunette, drawbar, and
trail lock assemblies .

complete gun, while the M 1897A4 is standard
for conversion of existing 1\-11897 guns
(O.C .11\'1 . 14510) .
In 1917 the A.E .F. in France and certain
regiments in the United States were
equipped with the French 75 mm M1897
gun as the standard for light field artillery
materiel. The performance of this
gun in battle was such that it was considered
the most effective light field gun used
in World War I . A considerable number
of these guns were purchased from France,
while similar guns were manufactured in
the United States. The parts of the American
and French manufactured guns are
identical and interchangeable .
As mounted on modernized carriages
which may be towed at any speed, the
75 mm gun is today a far more formidable
weapon than was its counterpart in the
last war. New ammunition, including
armor-piercing projectiles, has been developed
to give greatly increased range .
These guns are now being withdrawn from
service to be placed on self-propelled
mounts. No further production of these
guns has been undertaken .
GUN, M1897-This gun and its variations
are of built-up construction with
breechblocks of the cylindrical Nordenfeld

All modifications of the M 1897 carriage
through M1897A4 possessed the inherent
disadvantages of limited elevation and
traverse, with a maximum normal gun
range of only 6,930 yards . By burying the
trail, it was possible to obtain a range of
9,200 yards. It was, therefore, considered
essential to design a new carriage to mount

3 INCH ANTITANK GUN M5
nadeyuacy of existing antitank guns
when opposed by Heavily armored
vehicles resulted, in September, 1940, in
the preparation of specifications for a
3Â° gun sufficiently powerful to destroy
the most formidable tanks then in use .
It was recommended that a gun be constructed
to combine the 3 inch antiaircraft
gun tube, T9, the 105 mm breechblock,
and the 105 mm Howitzer Carriage,
M2 . This gun and its carriage were
standardized in December, 1941, as 3
Inch Antitank Gun, M5, and Carriage,
M1. Further-tests by the Tank Destroyer
Command resulted in the adoption of the
M5 gun and M1 carriage as a standard
antitank weapon late in 1942 . In 1943 the
M1 Carriage was modified and designated .

A The Map r development in 105 mm
howitzer uiatcriel has been in carriage
design . The present Carriage, M2A2,
capable of transport at speeds up to
thirty-five miles an hour, is a modification
of the Carriage, M1, designed for
draft by horses or slow tractors .
The 105 mm Howitzer, M2A1, is also
mounted on the self-propelled motor
carriage, M7, and the medium tanks, M4
and M4A3.
HOWITZERS, M2 AND M2A1-Possession
of the same general characteristics
makes these howitzers interchangeable .
The only difference between the two
models is in the design of their breech
rings . A sliding-type breechblock is used
with either howitzer. The piece is fired by
a lanyard attached to a firing mechanism
on the cradle .
CARRIAGE, M2-The M2 carriage has
a split trail, pneumatic-tired disk and rim
wheels, and brakes operated from the
driver's seat of the prime mover .
The unbalanced weight of the howitzer
is neutralized by a single-unit, springtype
equilibrator . The elevating arcs
serve as a seat for the trunnions of the
carriage. The elevating mechanism on
the cradle may be operated from either
side of the carriage. The axle and the
support are designed to compensate for
irregularities of the terrain when the
howitzer is in firing position .
The M2A 1 hydropneumatic recoil mechanism
is of the constant-length type . The
howitzer and recoil system are attached
to a sleigh . The piston rod is attached to
the cradle and remains stationary during
recoil and counter recoil .
CARRIAGE, M2A2-`f'he 105 mm Howitzer
Carriage, M2A2, Is the M2A1 Carriage
with newly designed shields which
give considerably more protection than
did the shields used on the M2A1 .
The Carriage, M2A2, is classified as
Standard.

would continue until 21 August. What went wrong? Critics have
insisted that Simondss plan to capitalize on a historic opportunity was
fundamentally flawed because it was too complicated and sought to
impose a rigid schedule upon a fluid tactical situation. Would a more elegant
alternative to the use of brute force in the form of heavy bombers
have been capable of producing a breakthrough? It should be remembered
that Simondss first attempt to break the German line at Bretteville-sur-Laize,105
Operation Spring, had been a bloody disaster which
failed to penetrate even the forward line on Verrières Ridge. In fact,
Totalize was only one of a number of 21st Army Group battles in the
Caen sector that exhibited similar characteristics.106 John A. English
noted that increasing firepower had made bold tank charges obsolescent:
In Russia and elsewhere, he wrote, Blitzkrieg foundered before oppo103.
The destruction of Worthington Force on Point 140 has been described in
detail by Stacey, Hubert Meyer, Roy, Reynolds, Jarymowycz, and English, and in virtually
every account of Operation Totalize.

Regarding the inability to maintain momentum, the air force complained that if the
armour had gone on, accepting more casualties, it could have reached Falaise that
evening. Greenhous et al., The Crucible of War, 311. Carlo DEste judged that [t]oo

nents prepared to wage Materialschlacht, an antidotal slugging match of
attrition. Attacking forces could no longer get through a prepared position
in depth without hard pounding.107
Simondss plan must therefore be seen as a logical reaction to tactical
realities which sought to take advantage of the opportunity the
strategic air forces provided while putting his prewar theories to the test.
The plan may have been complex, but defeating a strong defence in
depth required heavy firepower that could not be attained without
detailed all-arms coordination. Solving his original set of tactical problems
may ultimately have created others, but because there was no way
to move artillery forward quickly enough to keep pace with the advance,
a complex plan and a rigid timetable seemed preferable to a Phase II
assault with insufficient fire support. In any case, a problem more significant
than coordinating army and air force efforts was posed by the
difficult logistical requirements of moving the three second-phase divisions,
plus their supporting arms, forward through a battle area with few
roads. If the plan had an evident flaw, it was that Simonds had planned
the air strikes to neutralize armoured divisions which had subsequently
moved out of the target areas before the operation began. This fact was
clear to Simonds by the early afternoon of 7 August, and he may have
been guilty of allowing an element of inertia to guide his decisions.
Another major change in the plan would have produced chaos, however,
so Simonds apparently decided that an abundance of support would be
better than a paucity.
Given the success of the Phase I advance, should the second bomber
strike not have been aborted on the morning of 8 August in order to take
advantage of a fleeting tactical opportunity? Clearly, this was not an
option. Because the required lead time for cancellation of the Phase II
bombing was moved up along with H-hour, Simonds would have had to
make a decision by 0726 hours, at which time the situation of the lead
troops was anything but secure. A number of first-phase objectives,
including Caillouet, Lorguichon, and the quarry assigned to the RHLI,
were not yet in Canadian hands. Even by 0900, the original abort deadline,
the German counterattacks were just getting underway. At no point
before that time, therefore, did Simonds have any reason to call off the
bombers, confused as the situation was on the battlefield. It should be
recalled that Goodwood had died out partly due to a lack of fire support
in the latter stages, and the air force had been criticised for not attacking
targets in depth as the advance progressed. Simonds took these
lessons into account. Even if he had wanted to cancel the air strike
sometime after the lead squadrons began to move to the startline, by
then it was too late. The bombers were already in the air.

Best-Laid Plans
172 ? THE JOURNAL OF
Nonetheless, George Kitching, Kurt Meyer, and subsequent historians
have all claimed that waiting for the air strike prevented 4th
Armoured Division from exploiting the success of Phase I.108 Arguments
attributing causality for failure to The Pause take for granted that
Phase I had been brought to a tidy and successful conclusion by the
morning of the eighth. These arguments are utterly dependent on one
key assumption: that both the 4th Canadian and Polish Armoured Divisions
were ready and waiting at their startlines on the morning of 8
August while the Germans regrouped.109 This interpretation relies too
heavily on Meyers testimony.
From his vantage point in Cintheaux, Meyer claimed to have seen
the armoured columns loitering in front of their startline around noon,
with open country ahead and nothing holding them back besides the
order to wait for the Phase II bomber strike. The bombing commenced
at 1226 hours, so Meyer must have been in Cintheaux prior to that time.
According to his own account and 4th Brigades operations log, however,
Ned Amys squadron of the Canadian Grenadier Guards, the spearhead
of 4th Division, was held up north of Rocquancourt until after 1224
hours.110 Meyer likely saw either the lead formations from the night
advance, which were still in the area, or perhaps the tanks of the 4th
Canadian and Polish Armoured Divisions, not waiting in front of the startline,
but as they moved up to it.
111 In fact, no idle pause was imposed
upon the lead squadrons before Eighth Air Force made its bombing run.
With the first two myths thus repudiated, it should also start to
become obvious that the inexperience of the armoured divisions has
been exaggerated by attempts to explain the slow progress made on the
eighth. The bombing of the 4th Medium Regiment was probably a more
consequential factor in the Poles lack of success once they crossed their
startline than Simonds or Nicholson admitted, because it was the
medium and heavy artillery that fired counterbattery tasks, and the
effectiveness of the German gun screen in halting the armoured attacks
has been well recorded. Meanwhile, 4th Armoured Division was also sup108.

110. Amy wrote that after being told not to proceed to the startline until Rocquancourt
was clear, he and his men waited in our tanks for what seemed hours. The
reason for this long delay was difficult to understand as we were not passing through
the town but bypassing it to the north. Amy manuscript.

ported by the SPs of the 23rd Field Regiment, which was unable to
deploy in its allotted positions near Verrières until 1100 hours.112 Caution
resulted from open flanks, a lack of information as to friendly and
enemy troop dispositions, and insecurity based on the knowledge that
their tanks were inferior. It has become part of the Battle of Normandys
lore that soldiers on both sides referred to Shermans as Ronsons, but
as the tankers moved up past the burned-out hulks dotting the Goodwood
battlefield, why should they not have experienced the same psychological
results Simonds did when he watched them burn after
crossing their startline? Perhaps seasoned veterans would have been less
affected by such realities. In any case, Simonds used inexperienced
armoured divisions not by choice, but because they were all he had.
To a certain extent, the bombing attacks in Totalize were undertaken
simply because the resources were available. The weight of explosive
strategic bombers could deliver seemed to promise a way to break an
exceptionally resolute opponent. It had not yet been proven that heavy
bombing was an inefficient method of destroying ground defences,
although this conclusion was later reached by 21st Army Groups operational
research teams.113 The success of Operation Cobra, in fact, suggested
that bombing could achieve spectacular results. Simonds
therefore continued what was in effect an experiment in air support, in
hopes that victory could be achieved at a price less costly in the lives of
his men.
Totalize petered out because the advance had gone as far as it could
considering the fire support that was available. To defeat the Germans
required 2nd Corps to consolidate its positions, move the guns forward,
and tee-up another set-piece attack. The defences had to be destroyed
methodically before the breakout was possible, and as such the objective
that had been set for Totalize was unrealistic, despite the numerical
imbalance between attacker and defender. Although Falaise was not
reached, 2nd Canadian Corps did succeed in smashing two strong German
lines, and it crippled 12th SS in the process. The end of the Normandy
Campaign was then only a matter of time.

and it will ricochet and kill them in the turret,
or damage them so they will be of no use .
Our 105-mm gun is good against tanks . I
watched one gun hit three tanks coming in a
big mass of tanks, approximately thirty tanks,
and with high explosive ammunition he collapsed
three of them like taking shoe boxes
and shoving them flat. The rest of them scattered
or moved up to the right . We had to
leave because more were moving up.
The 50-mm gun is almost the same as to
amount of powder as the 88-mm gun . I think
their antitank guns are mostly 88-mm and
75-mm. The only 50-mm I have seen are in
Mark III's and Mark IV's . Just go slow and
watch them. Get your reconnaissance out in
front, men on foot . If you rush right out there
you will rush right into it. You want some
artillery well forward . 105-mm guns shooting
at over five thousand yards aren't much
value. I think they shouldn't ever be over
4000 yards in either direct or indirect fire.

We got a few of them and they went in their
foxholes. We shot at them and don't know
whether or not we got a lot of them. They will
stand there and use those 20-mm cannon at
you, but it doesn't bother you . I did run across
a small German or Italian tank and found the
tail end of a rifle grenade near it and the tank
was burned and . blasted to pieces .
Stukas with 500 pound bombs really don't
hurt the tanks unless there is a direct hit,
except for the dust. You have to move out
of it. When the _ Stukas appear the Germans
shoot green and white, or green and red,
flares, changing every . day-they also shoot
a blast of orange gas to identify themselves.
Another thing, they mark a target with three
smoke shells. After these three bursts you had
better clear out, for they will be over in about
one minute.
They use a lot of high burst ranging . The
artillery will shoot one, apparently getting
the range from a map, and they will hit one
overhead and then drop right down on you.

That commander stood there with
his glasses and proceeded to throw a lot of
high explosive shells. German tanks went in
all directions. That quadrant is very worth
while; and glasses are necessary .
Before we put a single round of ammunition
in our carrying racks we try them in
their guns. A lot of them won't fit, and the
battlefield is a bad place to find it out,
although I know of two sergeants who
climbed out under fire and rammed the shells
out.

1ST LIEUTENANT H . F. HILLENMEYER, ommander,
ompany ""H"", 1st Armored Regiment,
1st Armored Division . (Platoon Leader,
ompany ""H"", during battles of Faid Pass,
Rebaou, Sidi bou Zid .) 1 March 1943.
Sir, if we're going to get anywhere, we
must put greater emphasis on good reconnaissance.
I know of one instance where we went
into battle not knowing what was there . We
saw the enemy tanks go into Faid Pass and
that night we had a dry run back in our concentration
area . Next day when the attack
came off we found the thing was a blind-the
24
/LATER VIEWS AT THE FRONT
Pass was covered with deadly antitank stuff.
It plastered our one company that went in .
The Germans always seem to know what's
there before they attack. They use air-photo
reconnaissance. For several days before an
attack we can set our watches by the JU-88
that comes over each morning and evening
taking pictures . If we fire on him he'll hurry
home and come back with a pack of Stukas .
Those 88-mm guns have been causing us
trouble because it's hard for us to knock them
out with our flat trajectory weapons . They're
dug in too deeply and we need real artillery
support with good observation to root them
out.
When you fire on the German tanks, they
play a bag of tricks . First they stop, causing
you to think you knocked them out. When you
turn around on something else-whaml they
open up on you .
As a platoon leader, I learned that you've
got to lead your men. When you get out in
front, they'll follow you easily . If you're mov=
ing in sections, the platoon leader must go
in the forward section. And what's almost as
important is the fact that every man must
know what's going on. You've got to take
them into your confidence and explain the
show to them. They'll always respond with
better fighting.
You've probably heard this too, before, sir
-but the smaller units are simply not given
enough time to prepare their individual plan
of attack or maneuver. Higher headquarters
should realize that we need some time to get
the show running .
It would really be worth the time, over in
the States, for the . men to shoot at night with
tracer bullets. the Germans use all tracers
and sometimes they raise hell with the troops .
Tracers throw a helluva scare into you anyhow;
every one looks as if it's headed straight
for you. The Germans are cracker-jacks at
25
night fighting-our men need more training
in it.
In a scrap we throw high explosive stuff
until the enemy comes in range and then we
change to armor piercing . Sometimes we set
the high explosive for delay, fire low, and
watch the Germans duck wildly as it ricochets
over the ground.
I'm also concerned, sir, with another question
of tactics which is probably none of my
business. But we had always been taught that
the Germans attacked at dawn or in the early
morning light . Actually, however, they're even
more apt to hit at dusk with only half an hour
of light left in the sky, just to confuse you.
Then they'll throw everything they have at
you-including their star shells and Very lights
-in an attempt to put you on the run .
We don't fire on planes until they start
firing. If we did, we would have had the
Stukas on our necks every time.
It's extremely important that we keep our
star markings. Several times we were about
to open fire on our own tanks, until we saw
their markings .
One day an 88-mm shell knocked a piece
of armor plate into one of my tanks while the
shell lodged in the tank wall.
`Shut the door', the driver screamed to the
man in the turret, `there's tracers coming in

I almost lost my driver and assistant driver
once when the tank caught fire as the turret
was turned to the rear position. They were
able to get out only when another man in my

turned the turret, allowing these two to get

We had started across the field, sir, when
suddenly ten German tanks came up on our
flank. They opened up on me and hit me three
or four times before they came through .
Meanwhile we were firing continually .
About that time two 77-mm shells went
through .the turret and I discovered that my
tank was on fire. I called down to the driver
and radio man, but they must have been hit,
because they didn't answer. The tank was
burning badly now so I jumped out with the
remainder of my crew . Our tank was burning
yet, but it just kept going forward, and we
jumped into a ditch and watched it go .

Soon we were surrounded by German
tanks . We lay in the ditch for several hours
until one of the German tanks started toward
us. We thought he was going to run us down
so we stood up with our hands over our heads.
The German officer in the tank spoke good
English. He asked me where our side-arms
were and we told him we didn't have any.
He asked where our carrier was and we
pointed to our tank which had traveled
several hundred yards down the field before
burning out completely .
The German officer then pointed towards
our lines and told us to go so we took off
quickly.
All together we fired about 20 shells . We
hit two tanks and I know one was really
knocked out because I saw it go up in flames .

1st Armored Division, 1 March 1943 .
Yes sir, this is my third tank but I've still
got all of my original crew with me . We were
burned out of our other two tanks under fire.
Our ammunition supply has been goodwe've
always gotten the stuff we needed
although we had to quit our two tanks -long
before we used up our ammunition . A tank
commander has got to remember that he can
knock the track off a Mark IV long before he
can hit it with armor piercing ammunition.
The high explosive ammunition might be OK
against the Mark VI's, but we always saw too
many of them to give it much of a try.
The Germans usually open up with their
machine guns while they're ranging you in
with their heavier stuff. The driver can tell
when they're coming close so he keeps n-koving
and ducks them. I hardly ever talk to my
driver in battle-I just let him keep driving .
We always stopped to shoot but we did turn
the stabilizer on when we were moving . I
guess the stabilizer's all right for what it was
built.
The gunnery instruction they gave us in
the States was good . No sir, I wouldn't change
it. There's just one thing you must remember
when you're fighting Germans . When you
shoot at them they stop and try to kid you into
thinking you knocked them out. Then when
you turn your back on them, they open up
again. Sir, we shoot until they stop and then
keep shooting until they burn up .
Sometimes we've attacked with the sun in
our eyes and that makes it pretty tough on the
gunner. He can't see where he's shooting
while the Germans sit back there and pop
anywhere they want to.
AT THE I #_QoNr
I think, sir, that if you trained a battalion
of infantry to operate at night, they could slipinto
a German tank park and really raise hell .
One night after we were burned out of our
tank during action, we made our way to
within 30 yards of a parked tank, thinking it
was an Arab hut. They don't seem to worry
about security at night .
It's a good idea, too, to check your ammunition
closely. Once I had to climb out of
a tank during an action to ram a bent shell
case out of my gun, and then hurry back in
before the machine guns got me .

I'm on the right of my platoon -leader and
he's in the center. I've got another tank on my

and pretty soon at nine o'clock we run"" into
the Germans. They started in with their
machine guns but we just let it rattle by and
then they opened up with their heavy stuff.
I looked to the center and saw the lieutenant's
tank go up in fire . So I turned my gun on the
antitank gun that knocked him out. and
smashed it with my first shot of high explosive
ammunition. We knew that it was really
hot; nine of our tanks had been cleaned out.
They knocked my track off but I said, 'Hell,
we'll sit here and use her as a pillbox.'
Then one of my boys said our tank_ was
burning. I didn't know how long it had been
on fire . Still the fire didn't look too bad, so we
stuck by our guns and kept shooting until an
explosion almost rocked us out of the tank .
One of my crew was .wounded but the others
were all right, so we took off towards our own
lines. We walked for two hours and carried
the wounded man . with us . Several times along
the way German airplanes strafed us .

SERGEANT SWATZLANDER, ompany ""I"", 1st
Armored Regiment, 1st Armored Division .
Sir, if I had a brother coming in combat,
I would want him to know well the functioning
of the tank and all its guns . I would want
him to know personal care-just how long to
stay with a damaged tank before leaving it :
After it has been hit it is a big fire hazard . You
stay as long as you can . If you have to leave,
you do it quickly.
My tank crew were good ; I think they
were the best. I think we will lick the Germans.
I have one new man . He is good, learns
fast, and works well . He was formerly with
the 2nd Armored Division, I believe, and was
a truck driver.
Steel tracks are better than rubber track
when we don't have hard surface roads.
How do you know how to aim with the different
ammunition?
Learn and you know it. I don't follow a
table, I never look at it.
I run the tank by the inter-phone . No
trouble.
When do you button up?
I stay open.
The .50 caliber guns are good against aircraft,
especially to keep them up there and
prevent strafing.
I fire mostly individually and not as a section
or platoon.
I use cover and concealment as much as
possible, but there isn't any right here .

Don't lose your head; being jittery in battle
ruins a lot of communications . Keep your
head-main thing.
We have the right ammunition .
Don't button up your tank or you can't
see anything .
M4's are fine.
It's a funny thing, being tank commander .
You have got to run the crew, be stem, and
show leadership. I had a new driver for an
M3 tank . I told him to drive up a slope to a
certain place and then stop. He got excited
and went all the way up the hill. I told him to
back up to the right place. He got excited
again and went all the way back down the
hill. He wouldn't listen to the inter-phone
communication so I hollered to the 37 gunner
to stop him, as I had my head out . Finally we
stopped him and we drove up to a safe firing
place and I asked him why he didn't pay
attention to me .
Over night, I explained how I wanted him
to drive and how I wanted him to pay attention,
and I told him if he didn't I would close
his slot up completely and make him drive
blind. That fixed him. I think I have a good
driver now.
I am lucky, as I have never lost a tank, but
how I don't know . We saved two tanks out
of the company.
When our platoon leader told us to withdraw,
we withdrew by backing up . He became
confused, perhaps because his gun was
pointed to the side . Instead of backing up he
turned at right angles and ran up on a ridge .
He didn't come back.
I like the M4. I look at the German tank
and thank God I am in an M4 . The M3 is
nice looking, but should be three feet lower .
I think we will lick the Germans in time.
I think we are good.
INTER V/E W S
I haven't heard any news in four days ..
The rumor in the company is that we had
Faid Pass. But our platoon leader says `no'.
('No' was right.)
You can't do nothing unless you have a
good driver. He must go where you want him
to go.

SERGEANT SIPES, ompany ""G"", 1st Armored

New men need more 'training . They
haven't enough gunnery and no driving instruction.
I am a tank driver and was in action in
Faid Pass . I didn't get my tank out. I button
up my tank when not in bad terrain . I fire as
a part of the platoon if possible ; if not, I fire
individually . I fire in hull defilade and fire
both while moving and still .
I have learned not to rush into anything
you can't see. We fight too fast, should go
slower and be sure of ourselves . The best way
is to fight as a platoon . over each other as
they move forward. I haven't been able to
A T THE TR O NT

use the blitz tactics they taught us. vur tactics
is for some in hull defilade as the others move
forward.,
In my tank an 88-mm shell came through
the turret and set fire to the powder ; only
four got out, two out of the door and two out
of the turret . I don't think the door should be
locked. If the gun is to the rear, you can't get
out the door. I have an M4. There should be
a larger opening hole, so in case the turret is
to the rear, you can get out.
As a driver, I pick out targets and maneuver
into position with the help of the tank
commander . I know never to pull up over a
hill without stopping in hull defilade and observing
first .
I think we have learned a lot and can lick
them. It's bad enough to be on the winning
side, it would be terrible to be on the losing
side .
How close up is your maintenance company?
MAJOR MILLS, Regimental Motor Officer :
Just back of companies and battalion when in
combat.
T N K E R 5
OLONEL HAINES: The Battalion had
crossed 500 or 600 yards across a bridge which
was under fire. The maintenance was also
across . A message came in to the ommand
Post: `Need some of Pappy's boys'. (Pappy is
the motor officer and Pappy's boys are his
men.)
I asked if any big boys were needed ; the
answer was, `not just yet' . Â°
We have two pappy's, but we don't think
the Germans know them, or what each does .
The medium tank had damaged a track.
We sent a wrecker over under cover of darkness-
a distance of thirty miles . The wrecker
was not needed, but it did escort the tank
back, as it was thought that track would not
hang on. The tank had 31 track connection
guides broken loose and the tank was started
back to the service park on its own power
without repair with the wrecker following in
case needed. The tank came in without repair
.
Where do you change engines?
MAJOR MILLS: Back with rear echelon
maintenance if situation warrants it, closer if
situation is possible-in regiment.
OLONEL HAINES: The maintenance company
got cut up at Sidi bou Zid . They are now
doing swell military police duty and guarding
mine fields .
We drew 36 M4A2 Diesel tanks from the
British. We like them very much.
Â°NOTE: This was a perfect radio message .
Here is an example of a bad radio message : ' olonel,
my command post and command half-track arc 100
yards down from that tank burning on top of the
hill . Jerry is shooting everything that moves in or
out here. I am going to wait and move out when
I think he can't see me .'. I was beside this halftrack
which had been hit by a splinter when the
shot hit the tank .-TJ

We don't wear tin hats in tanks, but they
are never out of hand's reach.
Make your training program include more
battlefield tactics'.
More training in:
1 . Physical conditioning .
2. First aid (men have saved and can
save each other's lives) .
3. Marksmanship in major weapons .
4. Observation with field glasses .
5. Estimation of terrain, range, etc .
6. Personal reconnaissance .
7. First and second echelon repair for all
crew.
8. All ranks should know how to set up,
use, and maintain communications .
OLONEL HIGHTOWER: A lot more and
better target practice is needed for tanks. It is
better to miss 500 rounds in the United States
than one round here .
OLONEL HAINES: The driver is less important
than the gunner . The gunner should
have a higher rating .
The ` ' ration is cooked by the crew .
There should be a cooker in each tank .
OLONEL HAINES: lothing and combat
suits are adequate . Replacements are hard to
get .
I had trouble getting one soldier to wear
his helmet. He claimed it was too heavy . The
other day he came over to me . He said, `I'll
never be without this helmet again. You will
never have trouble getting me to wear it.'
'Why?' I asked.
He showed me his helmet. 'See this dent,'
he said, `just look at it .'

INTERVIEWS AT THE TRONT
INTERVIEWS WITH OFFI ERS AND
MEN OF THE 2ND BATTALION, 1ST ARMORED
REGIMENT, AFTER GENERAL
McQUILLAN'S ADVAN E THROUGH
REBAOU PASS, 11 APRIL 1943.
STAFF SERGEANT KERMIT JA KSON, ompany
""D"", 2nd Battalion, 1st Armored Regiment,
Krerouf, 11 April 1943 .
I've picked up a lot of stuff that I didn't
know when I came over here. The most important
thing that I've learned is to keep in
hull defilade at all times. You can't barrel-ass
across open country. In Sidi bou Zid we had
8 tanks left in a wadi with me. The platoon
leader gave orders to pull back . I decided to
get back as fast as possible and barrel-assed
back and got hit in the ass with an 88. If I
had backed out I probably would have come
out OK.
In a wadi, the company commander was
looking for a place to cross . He found one,
and 88-mm guns were waiting . They didn't
use their armor piercing ammunition but used
their high explosive ammunition . We all
crossed in column . They didn't open up until
the rear tank crossed, then opened with armor
piercing shell. I never saw so much armor
piercing. All tanks took off cross country and
tried to outrun bullets, but couldn't run fast
enough. I got in a hull defilade-and saw nothing
but fires . Every tank on high ground was
burning.
Any time that 88-mm guns open up you
can expect enemy tanks on your flanks, and
you had better start backing up or they will
follow a pincer movement about your flanks .
Now we keep ' more of our tanks in reserve
and on the` . flanks and we use the German
'cod-lock'. od-lock means a cinch . We pull
it on them since they have caught us and we
plan to use it on them in the future, too.
31
Here is what I mean by 'cod-lock' . In the
battle of El Guettar we received a report of
70 tanks that were preparing to attack . We
were all set. The field artillery was going
to give them air burst . We were going to put
some tanks out for decoy. We then were
going to suck them through the pass by
backing up through it. Back of the pass
was a reverse slope that had tank destroyers
on it, and back of them were a battalion of
tanks, who were going to attack on the flanks,
should they come through.
There was only one way, and that was
through the pass. We kept playing about out
of 88 fire and they started after us but
wouldn't come through. We have learned the
lesson and hope to teach the Germans a few
of their own tricks .
When a tank catchess fire, you come out
any way you can. I came out the turret once,
and not the escape door, as I was supposed to
do. In that escape I think most of the men
got out of the tank but didn't get back to our
own lines. Men should be cautioned to go
separately and not bunch up, as the Germans
will machine gun you if you are bunched.
LIEUTENANT HOLTZMAN: Sergeant Jackson
has received the silver star citation once
and has been recommended a second time . In
the second citation he gave help to a wounded
man under heavy shell fire after safely
maneuvering his tank to defilade the
wounded man. If he had not backed the tank
to help the wounded man he probably would
not have been here now, as several shells fell
where his tank had been.
The tank is the best slit trench in the
world when shells or bombs are falling; I feel
safe in it and stick close to it at all times .
I was commanding officer of my platoon
in the last fight. The Germans let the platoon
go through and started shelling me. They pick
the leaders off first if possible . I saw their fire,
T N K ER5 /N TUN/5 /A
and put out their gun position, but you can't
find the guns unles you see the flashes . They
usually camouflage their guns . They do a
damn swell job of it.

SERGEANT DE KER, ompany ""D"", 1st

In our last position at Gabes Pass, I saw
gun positions that had been tunneled 30 feet
back in the rocks . They were still good after
being shelled by 155's. After the capture of the
position I had permission of the platoon commander
to go in the area looking for German
radio receivers. These excellent gun positions
are not the rule, only when they have lots of
time.- Their general procedure is to mine gun
positions so tanks can't come up to run over
them.
LIEUTENANT LASELL, ompany ""D"", 1st

That sand mound might be a good German
gun position (he pointed to a sand
mound 200 yards away); you couldn't see the
gun from here .

LIEUTENANT Mc RA KEN, 2nd Battalion, 1st
Armored Regiment, Krerouf, 11 April 1943 .
Everyone thought SERGEANT JA KSON'S
buddy, SERGEANT HAMNER, was
cracked when he remarked that he saw a
building moving around. But it was a German
gun position . They are very smart and use
houses, sand dunes, or hay stacks as gun positions
. The moving building turned out to be a
vehicle with windows painted on representing
windows of a house .
The Germans not only hate lead and
shrapnel as much as we do, but they definitely
don't like smoke . I think SERGEANT JA KSON
will bear me out in this . It has an awful
effect on their morale.
Another thing is ricochet firing. atch a
tank approaching and drop a high explosive
32
shell 60 to 80 yards in front . Give it time to
travel the necessary distance and it will burst
on their heads . I don't like high bursts and I
know they don't either .
Ricochet bursts in a half-moon pattern and
has five or six times more explosive force than
ordinary ground bursts . It drives them down
in a slit trench; then wait for them to come
out, and then give them another one.
The German tanks and gun carriers have
their mufflers and exhausts pointed to the
high heavens rather than to the ground, thus
eliminating another possibility of raising dust
clouds .
One time when we were short of binoculars,
GENERAL WARD took field glasses
from his Division Staff to give to the tank
commanders .

LIEUTENANT BORESH, ommanding Officer,
ompany ""E"", 1st Armored Regiment.
The company was reorganized a month
before the battle of El Guettar. There was a
question of how it was going to work out . It
did quite well, better than I thought.
On the 31st of March I was called to
Headquarters at 11 :30 and was told that we
would attack at 12 :30. I had no time for
reconnaissance, only to locate gaps in the
mine fields that we had to go through, but
I had time to tell the platoon leaders the order.
The attack started on time and we came
under heavy artillery fire - when we went
through the mine field . After that- we got
nothing until we reached the top of a ridge
near the objective. A platoon leader was
-wounded. I led his platoon up cautiously and
got a little small arms fire. One of the tanks
got too fast and was knocked out . Later, when
we reached the objective, one of the other
platoons lost a tank also . After accomplishing
our mission, we took a defensive position and
began to fire on 88-mm guns that could be
/LATER V/E W S A T THE rR ONT
seen from our position . I think we knocked
out 4 guns and several vehicles that could be
seen on the road below, also a tank .
One German gun was hit at 3500 yards .
We fired at a lower level, estimated the elevation,
and hit it .
Although we have had air burst 20 to 25
feet off the ground, we were not hit . Lucky,
I think; air bursts are more frightening than
dangerous.

I saw a German Mark IV tank and an
American M4 tank fire at the same time once,
and both caught fire .
A tank has its place in a â¢ counter attack
where the enemy hasn't had time to place
antitank guns. They are also most useful in
the retreat of the enemy, but they are expensive
to make an attack with against a well organized
position. I believe that our losses in
personnel are light in comparison with our
tank losses . For tank losses of 8 we lost:
4 men killed.
1 crew of 5 missing.

DRAFT
POLICYTACTICAL HANDLING OF TROOPS
There are certain lessons which have been brought out repeatedly in
operations throughout the war and they must receive the continuous
attention of all officers if our troops are to have the success which is well
within their capacity.
The Effect of Artillery Fire
The effect of bombardment whether from aircraft or from guns is 90%
moral. The actual casualties to the defenders inflicted by covering fire is
always a very small proportion of their total numbers. Sudden and intense
bombardment, however, has a very considerable moral effect. It will keep
down the heads of all, except the outstandingly brave, and the leaders will
probably become casualties through blast or splinter effect. It must be
realized, however, that this moral effect is not prolonged and good troops
are very quick to recover as soon as a bombardment lifts. The effect of
covering fire during an attack, whether in the form of concentrations on
specific defended areas or in the form of a barrage, is to paralyse the
defenders for a short period. It is, therefore, vitally important to the success
of an assault that the assaulting troops shall follow closely their covering
Normandy: The July Battles
37
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
38
fire and must enter the enemy position very quickly after the bombardment
lifts. The risk should be squarely faced that in accepting a few casualties
by being too close to the covering fire, in the long run will result in far
fewer casualties in the capture of the enemy position. If troops hang so far
behind their covering fire that the defence can recover from the shock of
bombardment and re-man a position before the assaulting tanks and/or
infantry close, casualties will be far heavier than the few which may result
by leaning on our own supporting fire.
The essence of the German system of defence is the counter-attack and
it should be taken as a rule that a counter-attack will come very soon after
our leading troops reach their objective. There are three detailed operations
which must be carried out very quickly following the seizure of an objective
by our leading troops:-
(a) The position must be mopped up, i.e., the original defenders
must be killed or captured before they can recover from the effect of the
bombardment. This requires a detailed search of the position itself within
a matter of minutes of the arrival of the leading troops.
(b) Troops must be quickly disposed on the objective to repel the
counter-attack which is certain to come, and
(c) Recce patrols must be pushed out to find whether or not the
situation is favourable to a rapid exploitation beyond the objective.
The organization of an attack requires that specific bodies of troops
should be detailed to each of these tasks. The troops which are to secure
the objective against counter-attack must include tanks or anti-tank guns.
The initial phase of an attack should aim at a penetration of not less
than 4000 yards. It is necessary to penetrate to this depth to capture German
mortar positions or force their re-disposition. If local German counterattacks
can be supported by pre-arranged mortar fire they are very much
more difficult to contend with. The meeting of the counter-attack and the
business of mopping up is very much simplified if German mortar positions
have been overrun.
Attacking infantry must move steadily forward behind their covering
fire and apart from those specifically detailed to mop up the intervening
ground, troops must not stop and must not open fire until the objective is
reached. There are two reasons for this, experience has shown that if troops
stop to occupy a firing position it is extremely difficult to get them on the
move again and they lose their covering fire; secondly, all the ammunition
Normandy: The July Battles
39
which the infantry man can carry into battle will be needed to repel counterattacks
when the objective is reached.
Patrolling
The foremost units must maintain contact with the enemy. This
contact should be maintained by patrols rather than the main body of
forward units being placed on tactically unsuitable ground. Much has been
written about patrols and patrolling, but much of what has been written has
been and is being ignored. Recce patrols should be as small as possible
(two or at the most, three men). The men must be specially selected for
their suitability for this type of work and very highly trained. It is not a
question solely of the courage of the individual. There is a type of man who
has the heart of a lion but is utterly useless at patrolling, a menace to anyone
who accompanies him though he may be invaluable in the rough and tumble
of infantry fighting. Generally speaking from the point of view of their
suitability for patrolling, men can be grouped into two types. There are
those who like plenty of company when things are hot  these are no good
for patrol business. There are those who like to play a lone hand or work
with one or two tried companions  this is the type of man who is excellent
for a scout. There are those with all the characteristics of courage and
daring but who are quite incapable of moving quietly or unobtrusively and
they are useless for the patrol business. Specially selected and trained men
should be grouped in each unit in a special platoon. This is necessary
because only certain men are suitable and they should be kept especially for
the work. Whenever the unit is forward these patrols should work out and
should keep the unit continuously in the picture as to what the enemy are
doing on its front. Details of the minefields, wire obstacles, localities and
when they are occupied should all be obtained from working recce patrols.
Nothing is more dangerous than to sit down in front of the Boche and not
know what he is up to.
Forming a Patrol Base
The distance over which patrols can work during the hours of darkness
is strictly limited, especially when the hours of darkness are few during
short summer nights. It may well be that the most suitable tactical
disposition of a unit nearest to the enemy may be too far away to permit for
patrols to work out to contact with the enemy and get back again while it is
dark. In such a situation a patrol base should be formed forward within
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
40
patrolling range of the enemy position. A detached and tactically well sited
company can operate from this base and will be able to see off any minor
enemy offensive operations directed against it. The location of the patrol
base should be varied where the ground allows of alternative positions.
Fighting Patrols
The employment of a fighting patrol is only justified for a specific
operation with a specific object, generally the object will be to secure
prisoners and identifications. It is quite wrong to send out a fighting patrol
on an undefined mission towards the enemy to take prisoners, and until
sound information has been produced as a result of the work of recce
patrols, there will be few opportunities for the sound employment of
fighting patrols. When recce patrols have produced a clear picture of what
the enemy is doing, then a plan may be made to take out a particular enemy
position by a fighting patrol. Such an operation is a minor attack and must
be as carefully planned and given time for thorough recce by its leaders.
Badly organized fighting patrols usually result in not securing
identifications of the enemy but getting ambushed and giving useful
information to the enemy.

ADDRESS BY
LIEUT.-GENERAL G.G. SIMONDS, CBE, DSO
General Officer Commanding 2nd Canadian Corps, to Officers of 3rd
Canadian Infantry Division and 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade, at the
Chateau near Cairon (962744, Sheet 7F/1) on 16 July 1944
(reported by Major A.T. Sesia)
I have called this conference first to get you together and to welcome
3 Cdn Inf Div and 2 Cdn Armd Bde into 2 Cdn Corps, and secondly to say
how proud I am to have them in this Corps after their fine performance
during the past month since D-Day. I am sorry to say that of the Divisions
in the Canadian Army your Division is the one that I know the least. In all
my previous contacts with the Canadian Army there was not a formation
with which I was not closely associated, but your Division was the one with
which I had had the least contact. I wanted to get around to see the troops
and I had intended to do so yesterday, but unfortunately circumstances
prevented me from doing so. However, I expect that I shall be able to get
out to see them in a very short time.
I wanted to take this, the first opportunity that I could, to put before
you my policy in the tactical handling of troops and in administration
generally. First of all, I would like to say a word or two on just where we
stand. The Russian offensive in the East is going extremely well. From the
latest reports the Russians are some thirty to forty miles from the East
Prussian frontier. Here in the west, the German formations are all
committed including two which arrived recently from Russia. As far as we
can determine, the Germans are short of men and equipment, and we have
not so far encountered any fresh formations, nor do there seem to be any in
sight. Opposite us is the works so to speak. I think you remember
General Montgomerys remarks when he spoke to all formations prior to DDay
and said that we had the war in the bag if we made an all-out effort.
My view is that we will have the war in the bag this summer or at least
in a matter of weeks if we pursue the advantage we now hold. I cannot
stress too highly what effect this all-out effort will have on the enemy and
its advantages to us particularly from the point of view of our own troops.
If the war drags out, normal wastage will ensue and casualties will mount
up. On the other hand, by making use of an all-out effort our casualties may
be initially high, but in the long run they will be less. I think it is safe to
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
42
compare the enemy in his present situation to a boxer who is groggy on his
feet, and needs but the knockout blow to finish him off. I ask all
Commanders here present to put first and foremost into their minds the idea
of the all-out effort. You must always remember that if you rest, so does the
enemy; and the final outcome takes considerably longer. You must
therefore call on your troops for this all-out effort.
I want it to be absolutely clear in your minds that occasions will arise
when I will make heavy demands from you at a time when your troops are
tired, but the enemy is groggy. This produces great results and saves
casualties. There is always a tendency on our part to look at our troops after
a particularly stiff engagement and consider them tired without
appreciating, at the same time, that the enemy is more so. I think that the
Germans position as a whole is not far from the point of cracking up unless
he produces fresh formations. His prospects of producing fresh formations
from Russia are at present very slim although he may produce some from
Italy. There is no doubt that he may have a certain amount of
reinforcements to draw from but these cannot materially alter his present
position.
Operational Points
I would now like to mention a few operational points which I consider
essential. First, we must have the Offensive Spirit. This is absolutely
essential, and the drive must always come from the top. It has always been
written that the Commander inspires his troops. With us Canadians it is
different. Our Commanders are inspired by the troops. I have always found
the troops tired when the commander is tired, yet one has only to mingle in
with the troops themselves to find that the Offensive Spirit and the will to
carry an all-out effort is always present with the Canadian soldier, and it
should not be destroyed by the flagging spirit of a Commander who is tired.
The Offensive Spirit does not mean running up against a stone wall. If a
Commander finds himself up against stiff opposition he must keep finding
a way to break through the enemy. It is fatal to stop. He must never sit
down. He must always be doing something.
Secondly, once you are committed to an offensive operation there is no
holding your hand, regardless of casualties. As a Commander you must
consider at the outset whether the losses incurred are going to be worth the
final assault. You must determine whether these losses are going to be the
minimum you can afford in relation to the value of the objective.
Normandy: The July Battles
43
We cant fight the Boche without incurring casualties and every
soldier must know this. My point of view is that if I cant embark upon an
operation to take a certain feature, for example, unless it will be useful to
me later, the operation is not worthwhile. But if the operation is worthwhile
and I call it off with 50% casualties incurred, then I have achieved nothing
but a waste of lives; if I continue and incur a further 20% casualties and
bring the operation to a successful conclusion, then the operation is
worthwhile. I speak of casualties in grossly exaggerated figures. In no
operation yet I have participated where casualties were not between 15%
and 25% and, even at that, 25% is still a grossly exaggerated figure. You
must have realized by now, after your experience during the past month,
that it is inevitable in infantry warfare that casualties become greatly
exaggerated. In the fog of battle communications become disrupted and
units have become separated, and when the survivors start coming in they
report that their section, platoon or company has been wiped out. It must
always be realized that when a soldier is separated from his comrades he
feels that he is the sole survivor, and it is only after reorganization, possibly
three or four days later, that one realizes that casualties have been far lower
than at first feared.
Patrolling
Another very important point in connection with the Offensive Spirit
is the question of patrolling. Before the war and even during its early days
the doctrine of patrolling varied between the advantages of a recce patrol
and a fighting patrol. Since that time the definition of both has become
confused. From experience I say that both types of patrolling must be
clearly defined. Arecce patrol goes out to get information and bring it back.
Recce patrols should be small and made up of experts who know how to
creep about in the dark and in daylight, without being observed. They must
consist of men who are individualists and who enjoy the work. Obviously
the type of man required must be one who possesses personal courage. But
courage is not all that he must have. You may have a man who possesses
considerable courage but who, when he crawls five feet in the dark, cannot
do so without cursing. There are also men who possess great courage if
they are in company with others but are ineffective if they become isolated.
On the other hand, there are men who like to play alone or with a
companion or two. Fighting at the present time is not confined on a
continuous front  both sides have wonderful opportunities for good
scouting. WE must always bear in mind that the Boche keeps very still in
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
44
daytime. For the experienced there are all sorts of outward signs which
scouts learn to interpret. When, for instance, all movement has ceased in a
village we accept it that the Boche is there. When civilians are seen
returning to the village, then it is a pretty fair indication that the Boche has
gone.
A word on fighting patrols. In no sense should a scouting platoon be
used as a fighting platoon. In no sense should fighting personnel be
allowed to be held above others in your command. This is bad for morale.
Fighting patrols go on definite missions to take prisoners, and they go in on
information picked up by the recce patrol. When the fighting patrol is
working, the recce patrol should be either resting or seeking further
information in another sector. Under no circumstances should you have
your scout platoon at work when fighting is in progress for they should be
working hard when you are sitting down. Each company should have two
scouts in each platoon who are experts, and whose job it is to keep you
informed at all times as to what you are likely to run into. In this connection
I would like to say that the teaching in the battle schools is, to my mind,
wrong. Briefly, when a company is going into the attack and thinks it is
bumping into opposition, the forward platoon sits and another is sent on a
left or right flanking move. The Boche sits down and lets the platoon come
in and withholds his fire when withdrawing but the first thing the forward
platoon knows is that it has run into machine gun fire from 1000 yards
behind. Scouts should precede the platoon and be on the alert at all times
to prevent their platoons from walking into this Boche trick. I warn you not
to fill yourselves with apprehensions of the enemys tactics, because you
should not have apprehensions at all. If you are aware of the Boches
tactics, and I realize that you have all been in battle, you will also know that
although the Boche is a very good soldier he is no match for the Canadian
soldier. Our troops have been brought up with a different mentality, are
individualists and imaginative and it is up to you not to kill these qualities.
The Boche, on the other hand, follows a set drill in his tactics and seldom
deviates from it.
An important phase in patrol activity which must never be lost sight of
is the accurate interrogation of the patrol when it comes in. Patrols at the
present time should be organized at least on a Brigade level and preferably
on a Division level. The handling of these patrols and their interrogation
when they return must in some respect be the same in which an RAF
Intelligence Officer interrogates air crews when they return from a mission.
This interrogation must be complete in every respect. An example of an
incomplete interrogation occurred last night when one of our patrols
Normandy: The July Battles
45
reported that a Boche was seen to throw away his rifle and run when he was
approached by a patrol from 7 Cdn Inf Bde. As far as I am concerned I do
not know that the man who threw down his rifle was a German. He may
well have been a frightened farmer. The patrol had not brought back the
rifle in question. I say that if this patrol was close enough to see the man at
night, and also see that he had thrown down his rifle, then it should have
retrieved that rifle.
General Remarks
I am of the opinion that troops underestimate the effect of artillery fire.
I will admit that only 5% of artillery fire has a material effect, and that 95%
has an effect on morale; but it is in following up this effect on morale that
the benefit from artillery fire is derived. In my experience I would say that
the Boche recovers easily from a barrage in approximately ten minutes.
With the Italian it was different. It took at least three quarters of an hour
before he would show up his head and look around after a barrage. It is
vitally important that the landing assault troops must follow closely on the
heels of the firing. During the last war it was always said that full use of a
barrage was not made unless our troops suffered casualties from it. In other
words, unless we follow closely behind a barrage and take advantage of its
effect upon the enemy its value is worthless. We must, therefore, be
prepared to accept casualties from shells falling short.
The essence of German defence is the counter-attack. You should
never be surprised when he counter-attacks. You should be surprised if he
fails to counter-attack. The Boche is very effective with his mortar. Without
his mortar he is not effective and it has been proven time and again. I have
known instances where a hundred bodies, by actual count, of German dead
were found lying about a small position most of whom were killed by small
arms fire. The Boche usually sites his mortar 3,000 to 4,000 yards behind
his FDLs [Forward Defensive Lines]. In the attack, the initial assault wave
should go through at 3,000 or 4,000 yards behind his FDLs [Forward
Defensive Lines], in order to break up the mortar organization. This can be
done with speed of movement on the part of the assaulting troops and will
thereby cost the Boche very heavy casualties and break up his counterattack.
To achieve this, the leading troops must go through without
bothering about mopping up and also by side-stepping opposition.
However, the Boche who has been sidestepped must not be left alone for he
can be a source of considerable annoyance. Mopping up must be done as
quickly as possible behind the assaulting wave. The two requisites,
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
46
therefore, for this type of engagement are: (1) Speed in the assault wave,
and (2) cleaning up in the mopping up wave. These requisites are the only
method by which speed is obtained and access into the depth required.
Between both requisites a gap will inevitably follow, and this gap should
not be large. The moppers-up should be organized into section columns so
that one can deal with a pocket while the others go on. They should be
supplied with plenty of grenades and small arms. I am convinced that
attacks in short phases of 1,000 to 1,500 yards each are not effective and
become very heavily mortared.
With the increase of high velocity ammunition, armour, especially
when working with infantry, should not be employed unless behind good
covering fire and clear of minefields. It is all-important that when moving
alone tanks should cover the movement of other tanks. If a regiment is
moving in bounds, one squadron should always be employed to cover the
movement of the others against the possibility of well-sited 88 mm guns.
As far as the infantry is concerned the tank assists the infantry with fire
from its gun. It is essential that the closest possible contact between both
arms exist and I suggest that representatives from both arms with 18 sets
should be interchanged. The infantry officer with the armour could then say
what he wants, and the tank officer with the infantry could decide how to
do it.
My final point concerns Battle Stamina. Aflash in the pan formation
is useless. It has to be good to the end. This will only be the case if the
Commander down to the platoon commander or the equivalent will nurse
Battle Stamina. This hinges on two factors: (a) Physical and (b) Morale.
(a) Physical Factor  Good unit administration must be exercised
at all times to keep out sickness. Commanders should be careful to leave
selected personnel as LOBs [Left out of Battle]. This becomes most
important particularly in the case of heavy fighting. It is a vital mistake for
a Commander to LOB an officer or man of whom he is not certain. He must
find out once and for all in battle whether or not a man can prove himself
favourably or otherwise. Not to do so is the worst mistake that can be made
to encourage malingering or the tendency to go easy hoping to be left out.
By placing such a man into battle it is possible that he will prove himself a
worthy soldier, or if not, he will crack up or become a casualty. From the
psychological point of view this must be kept in sight at all times.
(b) Morale Factor  Morale is hinged to discipline. There is no
substitute for discipline. Just prior to the war wild ideas on discipline were
Normandy: The July Battles
47
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
48
let loose. The present form of discipline existing in the British Army has
withstood the test of battle, for centuries, and is suited to our temperament.
The worst thing a Commander can do is to relax on discipline. The Guards
Battalions have a form of discipline which is unique in itself, but it must be
realized that they Guards are not much different than other men except that
they have been chosen for the number of inches between their heads and
feet. The methods employed to achieve this discipline among the Guards is
not, however, suited to the Canadian temperament but the evidences of
results obtained should be the same.
If you explain to the Canadian soldier what is required of him and give
him a good reason for it he will produce the goods every single time and do
it twice as well as any other individual. From the national point of view we
must look to our contribution in this war in every respect. We must ask
ourselves what, from the national point of view, will Canada get out of this
war materially? The answer is: Nil. In fact, when the war is over we will
probably have to dig down deeper than ever before into our pockets to pay
for it. On the moral side, however, what do we get out of it? The answer
is: A great deal. We not only increase our own self-respect as a Nation, but
we also increase the respect for Canada from all other nations who have
come to realize her greatness. The opinion formed of Canada and
Canadians by peoples in Europe and Britain will be based upon the
impression created by the Canadian troops they see about them. It is a fact
that we are ordinarily judged by the external appearance and conduct of our
troops. Hence their importance.
Every effort must be made to ensure that the discipline and deportment
of our troops is kept up to the highest standard. I made it a strict rule in the
Mediterranean, and I intend to carry it out here, that any cases of offences
against the civil population will not be dealt with by the soldiers CO, but
by Court Martial. Every unit has its bad eggs and it is they, (fortunately
less than 1% of the total number of troops involved), who commit these
offences and they must be dealt with in no uncertain terms. This will have
its effect on other troops who might be inclined to commit the same
offences. One of the offences that is likely to be met up with is that of
looting. Many cases of looting are due to misunderstanding on the part of
the troops. There has not been much of it, but when it has occurred it was
generally due to troops passing by a wrecked building or house and, seeing
that its occupants had fled, thought nothing of picking up items more in the
way of souvenirs than anything else. This misunderstanding must be
dispelled by the officers.
It is very important that when things are bad the reins should be kept
tight. Dont do nothing. Commence smartening up, holding parades, etc.
Discipline among the officers and NCOs [Non-Commissioned Officers]
should always be at its highest. It must always be borne in mind that troops
are inclined to get morbid after hard fighting, especially in the winter
months. I hope that this war will be over before the winter months set in.
Bad weather is bad for the troops.
One point that I insist upon and which you may consider eccentric is
that I place great stress on saluting. First of all, I think that in any formation
we should act as a team, and it is inconceivable that in any other form of
team, members should walk by each other and not give some form of
recognition. As with everything else, salutation in the Army is regulated by
a universal method. Personally, I hate passing by a group of troops without
giving them some form of salutation. There are, perhaps, some reasons why
saluting drops off. In some units it is likely that troops do not salute
because they resent it. It is up to the officers and NCOs in that unit to seek
out the cause for this resentment and remove it. Another reason is that
troops sometimes just dont bother saluting. They follow the line of least
resistance. Some say The hell with it! I saluted three officers this morning
and thats enough for the day! A third reason for not saluting is that the
soldiers do not see when officers pass by. They will not see if they walk
with their heads down. An alert soldier walks with his head up. It is the
business of officers to see that their soldiers are alert. Afourth reason is that
officers never take the trouble to explain the custom of saluting and why it
is done. Officers should gather their troops about them at least once a week
and explain to them these and other points which soldiers either forgot or
have not known. I think that we publish far too many orders and never
enforce them. One reason why these orders are neglected is because
officers lose sight of the fact that in their unit there may be a heavy turnover
of new people who are not informed on these things. In theory, everybody
is supposed to know what is published in orders, but in fact, it is not so.
Officers must keep their troops in the picture at all times. The Canadian
soldier does not give his best when he is not in the picture.
It is a peculiar fact, but it is true, that usually troops in the forward
areas are far more meticulous about saluting than those at the Base. In the
Middle East it has invariably been found that the standard of saluting was
100% in the Forward Areas and at Base no one bothered about it. It is an
indication of a lack of m",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

c. Mass.-Concentrate your fire power and shock action on
the enemy . Do not fritter away your strength on small,
unimportant targets. Concentrate on an objective that is
decisive ; the others will then fall .
d. Conservation of ammunition .-The tank carries a relatively
small amount of ammunition and resupply is difficult.
It is imperative that each round be made effective . Do not
fire with the 75-mm and 37-mm guns until there is something
at which to shoot . (See sec . II .)
â 8, TERRAIN .-a. The tank is sensitive to terrain. For most
efficient use, tanks should operate over terrain that will permit
advance by covered routes at good speed.
b. The tank company commander must continually study
terrain and seek to turn it to his advantage .
c. The following types should be avoided :
(1) Ground covered with large stumps .
(2) Heavy woods .
(3) Swamps.
(4) Ground covered with large boulders.
(5) Steep slopes,
d. Just because ground appears impassable for tanks does
not justify dismissal of possibility of attack either by yourself
or the enemy over such ground . Only by detailed reconnaissance
can passableness be determined . In many cases passage
of difficult ground is justified by surprise effect gained .

SECTION II
TRAINING
19 . GENERAL.-a. Training of the tank company must be progressive
. It is divided roughly into phases as follows :
(1) Basic.
(2) Specialist .
(3) Marksmanship.
(4) Technique of fire .
(5) Section and platoon combat exercises without ammunition
.
(6) Combat practice firing .
(7) Company combat problems .
b . Each phase should be completed before proceeding to the
next. The efficiency of the company as a whole will depend
upon the thoroughness with which each individual unit is
trained .
c. Throughout the training period emphasis must be placed
upon cooperation, coordination, and individual initiative .
Training methods are covered in general in FM 21-5 .
d. Eact exercise scheduled for company training must include
training in ammunition conservation . Although exercises
are conducted without ammunition this subject must
always be kept in mind. During exercises the 37-mm and
75-mm gunners should be required to simulate firing and assistant
gunners should keep track of the number of rounds
the gunner has simulated firing . When all ammunition is
fired the gunner ceases firing . in this manner, and this only,
can troops be trained in the proper conservation of amtnunition.
If promiscuous simulated firing without thought of
ammunition supply is permitted, wasteful habits will be developed
. The tank commander requires frequent reports from
gunners concerning ammunition supply . The chart below
shows in a startling manner what a comparatively small
amount of ammunition is available,

SECTION V
MARCHES
6 22 . GENERAL .-a. The subject of marches Is covered In detail
in FM 17-10, 17-50, and 25-10 .
b . A good march depends upon good march discipline . This
can be obtained only by practice and rigid enforcement of
march rules .
c. Security on the march and at halts is covered in section
IV,
d. The rate of march of a tank column consisting all or
in part of medium tanks does not exceed 20 miles per hour .
A column composed of light tanks and half-track vehicles
may travel at a rate as high as 30 miles per hour. Such a
rate is advisable only in a tactical maneuver or when time is
crucial . Wear and tear on vehicles is great, deterioration
rapid. It must be remembered that a successful march is
one that Places the troops and equipment at their destination
at the proper time and in the proper condition to fight .
e . When air attack can be expected, and this is usual anywhere
in the theater of operations, distances between vehicles
during daylight marches are seldom less than 80 yards, approximately
88 yards per vehicle, This may be extended to
176 yards or 0 .1 mile. During night marches the density of
20 vehicles per mile should not be exceeded. However, vehicles
may be grouped into groups of approximately five,
closed to short distance . A good night driver is placed in the
leading vehicle of each group .
f. When combat is imminent, the company commander
will usually be with the battalion commander . Platoon leaders
assemble at the head of the company column . The company
is conducted by the senior platoon leader . Platoon sergeants
assume temporary command of the platoons . By such groupings,
orders can be given with less delay .
g. During the march certain designated members of the
vehicle crew must remain awake and alert at all times . When
contact is not imminent, one member detailed as alert man
watches for both ground and air attack . When contact
is imminent all members of the crew must be alert. Heavy
guns are loaded or prepared for loading . Machine guns are
34
THE TANK COMPANY, LIGHT AND MEDIUM
22-24
half-loaded . Everything is made ready for instant action,
Certain men are detailed as air and ground guards to give
instant warning of attack . Do not let yourself be surprised .
N 23 . HALTS.-a. Halts are usually made for 15 minutes after
the first 45 minutes of march . Thereafter, halts of 10 minutes
are made at the end of 1 hour and 20 or 1 hour and 50
minutes of marching. In long columns, halts must be made
on a schedule as most of the troops will not be out of bivouac
at the end of 45 minutes . A long halt, usually 1/2 hour, is
made after 4 hours of'running time . This is for the purpose
of refueling . Again, In long columns this must be a scheduled
halt .
b . Drivers and tank commanders make regular inspection of
their vehicles at halts . One man must be left in the vehicle
to man the vehicular weapons in case of attack .
SECTION VI
OPerENSIVE ACTION
â 24. GENERAL.-a. The tank is an offensive weapon . Its offensive
powers of mobility, fire power, shock action, and armor
protection should be exploited to the limit .
b . The tank company will habitually be reinforced during
combat . (See sec. I.) The company may be used either
alone or as part of the battalion . It is used alone in advance,
rear, and flank guards, and may be used alone as a covering
force. As part of the battalion it may attack-
(1) As the first echelon of attack, the mission of which is
to destroy enemy antitank defenses, artillery, command posts,
and other rear installations .
(2) As the second echelon of attack, the mission of which
is to destroy infantry targets, especially machine guns, heavy
weapons, and antitank guns passed over by the leading
echelon. It also destroys command posts, communication
centers, and other rear installations .
(3) As the third echelon of attack, which advances with
the Infantry and destroys enemy machine guns and other
enemy installations holding up the infantry,
c. It must not be assumed that the tanks always attack
first. Many times the infantry will attack to secure ground
from which the tanks may attack .
35
2 4-25
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
d . In attack battalions are usually given zones of action .
Companies are assigned a frontage and direction of attack .
Zones and frontages must not be so narrow as to restrict
maneuver.
â 25. ASSEMBLY .--a . Before any attack, except in repelling a
surprise counterattack or when attacking direct from march
column, the company will occupy an assembly area or intermediate
positions where tanks are repaired and everything
made ready for battle .
b . Security in assembly areas is discussed in section IV .
C . The assembly area is selected by the battalion or higher
unit commander . A battalion guide or staff officer should
indicate the area to the company commander .
(1) The area should afford concealment, should not be
within range of hostile medium artillery, should have good
standings for vehicles, and should have good routes available
for entrance and exit .
(2) The area is occupied in such manner that units are in
proper formation to move direct to attack positions without
going through the areas of other troops .
(3) The company commander, riding behind the battalion
commander in column, is given his area assignment . He
divides the area into platoon areas and leaves a guide, usually
the communication sergeant in the I/4-ton truck, to guide
the platoons to their positions.
(4) Immediately upon moving into the area, tanks are dispersed,
security is established, vehicles concealed, and necessary
maintenance performed .
(5) In moving into an area at night, a guide must be provided
for each platoon . After a platoon reaches its position,
each tank must be guided to its place by the tank commander .
'6) The road must be cleared rapidly . Vehicles must not
jam on the road . Tracks into the area are brushed out to
prevent disclosure of the position to hostile aircraft . (See
FM 21-45.)
(7) Platoon leaders establish a platoon CP, and send a
runner to the company CP. The company commander reports
to or sends a runner to the battalion commander . The bugler
is used as a messenger .

d . The attack position is as close to the line of departure as
is consistent with concealment . Here last-minute checks
are made and last-minute orders given . It is here that lastminute
coordination is made with infantry when tanks attack
through infantry .
â 26. FORMATION-4I . Figure 26 shows typical formations for
a tank attack . It should be noted that the diagrams show
only one formation for the platoons . These may be in any
prescribed combat formation such as line, wedge, column,
echelon, or line of section columns, depending upon terrain
and hostile dispositions .
1) The formation of three platoons in line is seldom use
It provides no reserve, is difficult to control, and has no
power for sustained effort . It may be used by a covering
force .
(2) The formation of two platoons in the assault is easier
to control than line formation and affords a reserve for influencing
the action, but has less sustaining power than
column formation . The support company is usually disposed
toward the exposed flank .
(3) Column formation affords maximum control and sustained
power . It is the formation for a penetration when
the company is not supported by another company . It has
the disadvantage of developing very little initial fire powei
(4) Another formation not shown in the diagram is one
platoon in assault and two platoons in reserve . This formation
is suitable when the situation is vague . Deployment to
right or left is facilitated .
b. During the approach to combat the company commander,
is at the head of his company . When the attack begins he
goes wherever he can best influence the action, He will
usually seek an observation point, probably close to the firing
positions of his tank platoon supporting the attack, from
which point he will be able to watch the attack of his
platoons . Here he controls by radio the maneuver of the
platoons and uses his reserve at the proper time. He should
not lead the initial attack unless such action is necessary
for psychological purposes . When he leads the attack lie will
become engaged in combat and will be unable to control his
company.

0 27. USE OF SMOKE.-a. Smoke is used by tank units to-
(1) Screen movement of tanks.
(2) Blind hostile observation .
(3) Neutralize hostile antitank guns .
(4) Confuse the enemy as to the real point of attack .
b. The use of smoke in any great quantity must be coordinated
by higher commanders . Even one mortar can, if there
is a cross wind, lay down a smoke screen that will hinder the
movement of adjacent friendly troops .
c. Each medium tank and each assault gun has a limited
number of rounds, usually five, of smoke ammunition . They
cannot lay down an extensive smoke screen . This ammunition
is used only for temporarily blinding observation of
antitank guns so the vehicle may close with the gun or move
to a more favorable position . The 81-mm mortar of the
tank battalions carries a preponderance of smoke ammunition.
Its high rate of fire, 30 rounds per minute, allows it
to lay down a heavy smoke screen in a short time . (See
FM 17-27.)
d, For screening small targets a cross wind is best, as only
one round if fired to windward will suffice for concealment .

However, a cross wind will blow smoke into the zone of the
adjacent unit and fire must be controlled .
e . For screening an attack a wind blowing directly toward
the enemy position is best . Smoke laid in front of the enemy
position will drift to the rear and cover rear areas as front
areas become free for attack . CAUTION : Do not lay a smoke
screen when the wind is blowing from the enemy toward
you unless you desire to withdraw .

attacked by the enemy or in a meeting engagement when time
is essential, attack may be made direct from march column .
with halt made only long enough to issue orders and perform
the minimum of reconnaissance.
b. If the column is unexpectedly attacked from the flank .
each platoon moves directly to the attack . It rallies on the
road or at such other place as the company commander may
direct by radio . The platoon leader gives his order for attack
by radio and at the first opportunity reports to the company
commander . When platoon leaders are at the head of the
company column they must, with all possible speed, return
to and assume command of their platoons .

â 29 . ATTACK OF POSITION .-a. Such attacks are preceded by
movement into assembly areas, reconnaissance, and movement
to attack positions . Such attacks may be penetrations
or envelopments . When one or both of the enemy's flanks
are open, envelopment is usual, Penetration is followed by
envelopment of the flanks created .
b . Attack of a position is characterized by coordination of
all fires, artillery, mortars, assault guns, supporting tanks,
and dive bombers. When the enemy position is held in
strength and is protected by mine fields, the infantry usually
attacks first, protected by artillery and mortar fire . When
mine fields or tank obstacles are to be removed, infantry and
engineers, protected by smoke and heavy artillery and machine-
gun fire, remove mines and make paths for the tanks .
The tanks then attack through the gaps created .
c. Tanks may attack ahead of infantry to break down wire
entanglements and destroy hostile automatic weapons,
d. Artillery fire must lift when tanks approach within 300
yards of its target . The protection afforded by the artillery
is taken over by the assault guns, mortars, and supporting
medium tanks. Economy of ammunition must always be
considered . Medium tanks and assault guns cannot lay down
sustained artillery fire .

or other means of fire and maneuver . (See fig . 40 .)
a, In the leapfrogging method of advance, the first platoon
covers the advance of the second and third platoons to their
next position and then moves around or through the second
platoon to its new position, which places the first platoon in
advance of the second platoon . The second platoon then
covers the advance of the first and third platoons to the next
position, The solid line indicates the direction of movement
of the first platoon, and the dotted line indicates the actual
route taken by the first platoon to reach its new position .
b . In moving by bounds, the first platoon covers the advance
of the second and third platoons to their next position, and
then moves to its new position . The operation is then repeated
. The use of this method always keeps the same platoons
in the forward positions .

0 31, ATTACK WITH INFANTRY.a. The infantry may attack
ahead of the tanks, with the leading wave, or with the rear
echelon. It may be in carriers or dismounted, depending
upon the strength of the enemy . It must dismount when
taken under heavy enemy fire,
b. In a vague situation infantry will advance with a light
tank company, It will follow one of the tank platoons in
carriers until serious resistance is met . It may then be used
to form a base of fire for the tank attack ; to attack supported
by tank, mortar, and assault gun fire ; to destroy resistance
which cannot be reached by tanks ; to maneuver dismounted
to the flank to destroy enemy antitank guns holding up an
attack . There must be liaison between the tank company
commander and the infantry commander . The infantry platoon
commander has an SCR-510 radio set with which he
may communicate with the tank company commander .
Should he not have the proper crystals for this communication,
the tank company commander uses his own half-track
as a liaison vehicle, causing it to move with the infantry
platoon commander.

smoke or fog, tanks lose direction, may crash into each other,
and will be forced to slow down . Maintenance of direction
is difficult at best . The tank compass will be hard to see if
smoke gets into the tank.
b. When a tank platoon or company commander sees
that his unit is about to be smoked, he orders the tanks to
move at maximum speed to defilade positions . Some tanks
on the flanks dispose themselves to protect the flanks to
repel a counterattack that may be following the smoke
screen . All prepare immediately to resume the advance at
maximum speed when the smoke clears . The support platoon
and assault gun prepare for immediate resumption of
fire. These may be moved to a more favorable position to
bring fire on the enemy .

DEFENSE
â¢ 38. GENERAL .-a. The tanks' offensive power must be used
in defense for counterattacks . They are not used as stationary
pill boxes except as a last r esort. FM 17-10 covers
in general the employment of armored units in defensive
combat.
75
38-41
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
b. In defense, infantry and engineers hold the main line
of resistance while tank units form the reserve for counterattacking
hostile forces preferably before they reach the
infantry lines .
â¢ 39. DEFENSE OF A POSITION In defense of a position, the
tank company will normally operate as part of the battalion .
(See FM 17-33 .) Here it is used to attack as described in
section VI . In the defense, careful reconnaissance is made
of all terrain over which a counterattack might be made and
arrangements made with local infantry commanders for passage
of lines and coordination of fires .
â¢ 40. WITHDRAWAL .-In withdrawal, tanks are used as counterattack
forces to make shallow attacks on a wide front to
slow up the enemy attack and permit friendly troops to withdraw
and reform . The company will usually be with the battalion
. In these attacks, the rallying point is normally
the attack or assembly position .
i 41. DELAYING AcTIoN .-Delaying action is similar to withdrawal,
the tanks being used to attack the heads and flanks
of hostile columns . In delaying action do not allow yourself
to become so heavily engaged as to be unable to withdraw .

same as the advance guard except in reverse order . The
rear guard may have to fight a delaying action . It can expect
no help from the main body .
SECTION VIII
JUNGLE WARFARE
â 43. GENERAL .-fl. FM 31-20 covers the general subject of
warfare in the jungle . In general, because of their sensitiveness
to terrain, tanks are unsuited for mass employment
in jungles . Their use in such operations will usually be limited
to groups of a company or less, supported by infantry .
A tank platoon might be attached to an infantry company .
b. Light tanks are more suited to jungle operation than
medium tanks.
c. Operation in jungles is usually confined to narrow
trails through dense growth relieved at intervals by open
spaces . Much of the trail may be swampy and require pioneer
work of considerable extent before the tanks can traverse
ft .
â¢ 44. ATTAcx.-Infantry leads on the jungle trails, develops
the enemy, and the tanks then attack . Such operations are
a continuous series of small attacks ; at one time tanks lead
and the next, infantry .
â¢ 45. DEFENSE. a. Infantry defends the trails by placing
antitank mines and machine guns to cover them . The open
spaces are covered by fire . The tanks are held in reserve
to counterattack if the enemy succeeds in reaching the open
space .
b. Tanks may be used to delay the enemy by turning the
turret guns to the rear and withdrawing from one vantage
point to another .

SECTION I
GENERAL
â¢ 1. SCOPE AND PURPOSE-a . This manual covers the tactical
employment of the light and medium tank battalions both
as. part of a larger force and when acting independently . It
is designed as a guide only and does not lay down a set of
inflexible rules . Each tactical situation must be solved on
its own merits and the initiative of individual commanders
must be encouraged .
b. Although not written specifically for the separate tank
battalions, the fundamentals covered herein and formations
shown are generally applicable to those units.
â¢ 2. ORGANIZATION.-a. Armored battalion.-The armored
battalion has a headquarters and headquarters company and
three tank companies . For details of organization see current
Tables of Organization.
b. Separate tank battalion.-The separate tank battalion
is similar in organization to the armored battalion except that
a service company is added for administrative purposes and
for maintenance .
c. Headquarters and headquarters company .-The headquarters
and headquarters company consists of a battalion
headquarters and a headquarters company . The headquarters
company is further divided into company headquarters,
an assault gun platoon, and a mortar platoon . The company
has a small maintenance section for maintenance of company
equipment only . Figures 1 and 2 show in chart form the
organization of the company. A small reconnaissance platoon
is provided for the battalion headquarters .
â¢
3. FUNDAMENTALS-a . The tank battalion operates by surprise,
fire and maneuver, and concentration of effort (mass) .
(1) Surprise is obtained by speed of maneuver, use of cover
and concealment, striking at an unexpected time in an unexN

for combat provision for ammunition supply and the regulation
and coordination of supporting fires of all arms
Special consideration is given during the preparation to
measures designed to insure the continuity of the attack
Adequate provision is made for placing in readiness the necessary
material and engineer units to destroy obstacles assist
the advance of tanks and heavy weapons and for the construction
of roads connecting our own system with that of
the enemy
All preparations for the attack are completed as far as
practicable before the occupation of final assembly positions
Preparatory measures likely to betray the imminence of the
attack are carried out secretly or are deferred as long as
possible
Restrictions are imposed on those activities within our front
lines and in rear areas which may disclose to hostile reconnaissance
operations for the attack Strict surveillance is
imposed on the use of radio communication
0 528 The plan of attack consists of the plan of maneuver
and plan of fire The attack unit artillery and supporting
combat aviation commanders make detailed arrangements
for coordinating the action of their units to carry out the
common mission (See pars 498-500 )
In coordinating their plans it is essential that the supported
and supporting commanders carefully study the successive
compartments of terrain in which hostile resistance
may be encountered and identify the successive intermediate
objectives of the attack
An agreement is reached relative to the known targets to
be taken under fire respectively by the artillery by combat
aviation and by the other supporting weapons Areas to be
kept under surveillance for targets appearing after the attack
is launched especially those targets in adjacent zones which
are dangerous to the advance are agreed upon Associated
commanders must arrange for mutual reinforcement of fire
529 Attack unit commanders must receive early information
of their assembly positions and zones of action in order
that they may make their own reconnaissances and formulate
plans
Attack units usually move at night into final assembly
positions preparatory to an attack the next morning Move-

OPERATIONS
529-532
ment of units into their assembly positions by day generally
is practicable only when visibility is poor or when overwhelming
artillery and combat aviation support is available
When tanks are employed their assembly positions and
routes of approach are reconnoitered marked and prepared
530 The first mission of the artillery is to protect the
movement into and the assembly positions of attack units
During this phase hostile artillery and observation posts constitute
its principal targets Registration fires should be
conducted so as not to disclose the impending attack The
artillery gives special consideration to those measures which
will attain surprise in the opening of effective fire gain fire
superiority over the hostile artillery and concentrate the
mass of its fire on the decisive objectives
0 53 Artillery positions are selected so that fire can be concentrated
on the objectives of the attack Defilade concealment
from air reconnaissance and proximity to observation
are sought Sufficient time is allowed for the preparation of
firing data establishment of signal communication and organization
of the artillery ammunition supply
Artillery usually moves into position by echelon The
movement is frequently wholly or partly executed at night
Units assigned to positions screened from hostile air reconnaissance
are moved first The movement of artillery is
regulated to avoid interfering with the attack echelon in its
occupation of final assembly positions Long-range artillery
is placed well forward to be able to take under fire the most
distant echelons of the defender's light and medium artillery
0 532 During the advance of the attack echelon from assembly
positions the hostile artillery constitutes the principal
target of our artillery fire Superiority over the hostile artillery
is indispensable for the success of the attack It
rarely can be attained after the attack is launched
Located hostile batteries are silenced early in the artillery
action Their neutralization then is maintained by a portion
of the artillery in order that the mass may be employed on
other missions until again required for counterbattery fire as
new hostile batteries are located If counterbattery fire is
unable to gain superiority over the hostile artillery neutralization
of the hostile observation just prior to the attack
is of great importance
9
533-535
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
533 Artillery fires prior to the hour of attack may be limited
to normal fires already in progress or the attack may
be preceded by an artillery preparation
The duration of the preparation varies with the situation
A prolonged preparation is destructive of surprise and gives
the enemy time to take countermeasures The length of the
preparation is influenced also by the extent to which tanks
are to participate in the attack and the role assigned to
them The duration of the artillery preparation may vary
from 5 minutes to several hours
The nature of the artillery preparation depends upon its
mission Concentration of effect is greatly favored by dividing
the preparation into phases
The object of the first phase of the preparation is to neutralize
the defender's artillery destroy the most important
hostile agencies of command and fire control isolate the
defender's forces from the rear disrupt assembled hostile
mechanized forces and protect our troops from the enemy's
counterpreparation fires Artillery fire of the first phase
comprises counterbattery fire ; destruction fire on command
posts observation posts and signal communication Installations
; interdiction and destruction fire on enemy routes of
communication; destruction fire on mine fields and hostile
obstacles ; and concentrations on the hostile defense areas
and assembled mechanized units
In the subsequent phase of the preparation sufficient artillery
continues counterbattery fire to maintain neutralization
of the hostile artillery The fire of the mass of the remaining
artillery is concentrated on the hostile defense areas
â¢ 534 During the preparation other supporting weapons
fire on sensitive points in the advanced zone of resistance
Supporting bombardment aviation is concentrated against
hostile artillery signal communication centers and reserves
with particular attention to mechanized units which cannot
be covered effectively by artillery During the last few minutes
of the preparation bombardment aviation; is concentrated
upon the hostile defense areas
CONDUCT OF THE ATTACK
â¢ 535 The attack is characterized by the positive action of
fire and movement combined and controlled to create a preponderance
of force in the decisive direction
20
OPERATIONS
536-538
â¢ 536 The attacking echelon advances from its final assembly
positions so as to cross the line of departure at the
prescribed time Any mass formation of units runs grave
risks of incurring heavy losses from hostile counterpreparation
fires and air attack The leading echelon is therefore
thin initially ; its fire power is gradually built up as the
enemy discloses his plan of defense
When fire superiority has been gained the leading echelon
closes to assaulting distance
â¢ 537 Superiority of fire rests chiefly upon the mutual support
of units in the attacking echelon and the coordination
of their action with the fire support of artillery bombardment
aviation and supporting tanks It depends not only on volume
of fire but also on its direction and accuracy
Fire effect is increased by enfilade action Flanking or
oblique fire is especially effective when frontal fire is delivered
simultaneously against the same objective A convergent fire
forces the enemy to defend himself against attack from several
directions and creates a powerful moral as well as material
effect
Units seek to gain flanking fire by enveloping action
Flanking fire is also secured through the lateral echelonment
of supporting weapons with respect to the units they support
Heavy machine guns from positions in adjacent zones of
action deliver oblique fire over the troops in their front and
protect the flanks of troops in the attack echelon Light
machine guns of rifle units follow the leading elements
closely in order to take advantage of and deliver flanking fire
through the gaps along the front Units which have succeeded
in gaining advanced positions deliver flanking fire
across the front of adjacent rearward units
Lateral echelonment of artillery for purposes of flanking
fire increases the difficulties of fire control and of liaison between
the artillery and supported units The fire of supporting
artillery is more reliable and effective when its positions
and observation posts are in the zone of action of the supported
unit
538 The attacking echelon advances to assaulting distance
of the hostile position under its own and supporting
fires Until the main hostile resistance is broken attack
units advance by bounds to successive terrain lines on each
2
538-542
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
of which the fire support for the next bound is organized
Fire and movement are alternated in such manner that an
attack unit whose advance is made possible by the combined
fire of adjacent and supporting units moves forward to an
advanced position and by its fire from that position assists the
advance of the adjacent units
â¢ 539 Troops transported by air may be employed to seize
hold or destroy objectives which contribute directly to the
success of the main attack
â¢ 540 Artillery and other supporting weapons insure continuity
of support by displacing forward in groups (by
echelon) while the bulk remains in position and maintains
fire Fire is lifted successively to more distant targets as the
attacking echelon becomes endangered by it When supporting
artillery heavy machine-gun and mortar fires are lifted
from the hostile position to permit the attacking echelon to
close with the enemy the loss of this support must be compensated
for by the increased fire of the lighter weapons and
by the cooperative action of tanks (See ch 6 )
â¢ 54 Artillery supports the attack through the depth of the
hostile position by successive concentrations in accordance
with the requests of the supported commanders Concentrations
of artillery fire are regulated to bring the greatest possible
volume of fire on objectives of decisive importance at the
critical moments of the attack Attack units take immediate
advantage of artillery fire effect to gain ground to the front
The artillery is prepared for early movement forward to maintain
close support as the attack progresses Essential fire
missions of units being displaced are distributed to units in
position
â¢ 542 Artillery must employ all means at its disposal (observers
liaison sections airplanes wire and radio communication
to attack units) to obtain exact information of the loca;
tion of the front line The attacking units must cooperate
by employing all means of transmitting information to the
artillery (display of panels pyrotechnics and various other
means of signal communication) When uncertain as to the
location of the attack echelon direct support artillery takes
immediate steps to establish close contacts with those
elements
22
OPERATIONS
543-548
â¢ 543 During the attack the supporting fires are concentrated
against the fronts where the attacking echelon is
making the greatest progress Artillery fires are supplemented
by fires of other supporting weapons The fire of these
weapons is used to increase the density of the artillery fire
or is placed on those areas and targets which can not be
effectively engaged by the artillery When the attack echelon
arrives close to the hostile position the fire of all artillery
including that in general support is concentrated on rearward
hostile defense areas
â¢ 544 The primary purpose of close supporting fire is to
prevent the enemy from manning his defensive works in time
to meet the assault Its progression to successive objectives is
arranged between supporting and supported commanders
It may be regulated by a time schedule based upon the probable
rate of advance of the attacking troops by signal given by
assaulting troops or by a time schedule based upon a desirable
duration of the fire
Other fire is placed on critical points in the hostile position
to protect the attack echelon from hostile long-range and
flanking fires and from counterattack It is lifted to correspond
with the advance of the attacking echelon
â¢ 545 Each attack unit uses the close supporting fires of its
artillery and other supporting weapons to close with the
enemy and to push on to its successive objectives without
deviating from the prescribed general direction of attack
â¢ 546 Combat aviation supports the attack through the depth
of the hostile position Commanders of the supporting aviation
thoroughly familiarize themselves with the terrain in the
zone of the attack Supporting combat aviation is concentrated
over that part of the hostile front where the attack
seeks decisive results Its operations are coordinated to provide
the maximum support at the time the ground forces
launch the attack
â¢ 547 The attack must not permit its advance to be long arrested
by hostile chemical concentrations Contaminated
terrain which cannot be avoided is posted and passed with
the protection of gas masks
â¢
548 Whether the main attack is based upon an envelopment
or a penetration the battle generally develops into local

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
conflicts along two opposing fronts During the course of
battle the combat action of units may undergo a change as
between envelopment and penetration A force that has successfully
enveloped the enemy's flank may have to make a
frontal attack to defeat a hostile reserve or may find a favorable
opportunity to attack the hostile resistance in flank
In a penetration once minor resistances have been overrun
the outflanking action of small units is the most effective
means of reducing the stronger hostile defense areas
â¢ 549 An attack seldom is executed exactly as planned As
long as the enemy has any freedom of action unexpected difficulties
are encountered which culminate in a crisis The
approach of this critical phase of the attack must be recognized
by the commander so that timely measures can be
taken to shape the course of action to secure a favorable
outcome or to prevent a reverse (See pars 476-482 )
â¢ 550 When the attacking echelon approaches assaulting distance
observation aviation is employed to observe especially
the situation of our own and the hostile advanced elements
Observers on this mission report to the division commander
and the commanders of infantry units the points where the
attack is stopped and those where penetrations have been
effected hostile counterattacks and other features of the
situation of our own and the hostile advanced elements
Other observers continue to inform higher commanders concerning
developments farther in rear of the battle front such
as shifting of hostile reserves arrival of reinforcements train
movements and the like From these reports and other
information commanders direct the movements of reserves
toward those portions of the hostile front that offer the greatest
prospects for decisive success and to support the attacking
troops in repulse of counterattacks Combat aviation is effectively
employed to attack enemy reserves and counterattacking
forces
8 55 In an attack of a stabilized front the approach has
already been effected and the attack opens with a coordinated
assault The hour of the assault is fixed by the commander
of the whole front from which the assault is to be launched
The exact day and hour is kept secret until the latest practicable
moment

forces have been in contact makes available more detailed
information of the enemy's defensive dispositions The
completeness of information will depend upon the length of
time the front has been stabilized and the efficiency of intelligence
measures Available information is augmented by
continuous reconnaissance Reconnaissance throughout preparation
for the attack is conducted in such manner that the
appearance of normal activity is maintained Information
is disseminated in the form of intelligence summaries maps
and air photographs
THE ASSAULT
â¢ 553 Against a strong resistance and well-organized defense
the superior commander will prepare the assault of the
first hostile organized line of resistance by concentrating the
firepower of all supporting weapons including combat aviation
to neutralize the enemy and gear down his power of
resistance before launching the assault After the first onrush
a series of local assaults delivered by units of varying
strength on their own initiative continues the action Each
unit delivers its assault at the earliest moment that promises
success
The commander of the unit will have arranged to deliver
the assault on a time schedule or will notify the supporting
weapons by a prearranged signal that he is about to assault
The intensity of supporting fires is increased Under cover
of the supporting fire the assault unit advances close to its
objective When the supporting fires are lifted from the
objective the assault unit overruns the hostile resistance in a
single rush Any delay in launching the assault after the
fires lift allows the enemy to man his defenses
CONTINUATION OF THE ATTACK
554 After the assault of an organized position the attack
often breaks up into a series of eparate combats which are
continued throughout the depth of' the hostile position Th e
combats are directed by subordinate commanders within their
zones of action and are supported by all the means at their
disposal The first task is to capture assigned objectives
Resistances are reduced by fire or are outflanked
The utmost importance attaches to maintaining the continuity
and direction of the attack by the timely movement

and employment of reserves and by the timely displacement
of the artillery and other supporting weapons Reserves are
disposed behind points where the greatest progress is being
made to protect the flanks of the leading units and support
them in the repulse of counterattacks Artillery and air observers
search for probable assembly areas of hostile reserves
so that enemy preparation for counterattack may be broken
up by artillery fire and air attack If the attack is unable
to make further progress the captured terrain is organized
for defense and held until the attack can be continued
â¢ 555 The enemy's reaction following the successful assault
of his main line of resistance road conditions and the possibility
of maintaining ammunition supply determine when
and in what strength the artillery will be moved into advanced
positions
Artillery executes its missions with the fewest possible
changes of position Frequent changes of position reduce
the volume of fire support The occupation of new positions
and renewal of fire require considerable time Nevertheless
change of position should unhesitatingly be made when fire
effect or deficiency in liaison with the attacking echelon requires
it Changes of position generally are effected by echelon
after timely reconnaissance of advanced position
Artillery promptly fires upon enemy troop assemblies troops
forming for counterattack and on any rearward position on
which the enemy attempts to reconstitute his defense
â¢ 556 If the tide of battle turns against the enemy he may
endeavor to disengage his forces and renew the defense on
a rearward position or he may fight a delaying action until
battle can be renewed under conditions more favorable to
him Ordinarily the enemy will strive to hold out until nightfall
and effect his withdrawal under cover of darkness
Frequently the enemy will disclose his intentions to withdraw
Attacking troops must exercise great vigilance in observing
the conduct of the enemy in their front press their
attack with energy and maintain close contact' with him
Observation aviation searches the rear areas for indications
of retrograde movements of artillery and trains
a 557 If the enemy succeeds in withdrawing his major forces
from action the commander intensifies reconnaissance to
obtain the necessary information on which to decide what

line of action to follow Aggressive action may prevent the
enemy from reconstituting his defense on a rearward position
If the enemy succeeds in occupying a new position during
darkness a renewal of the attack in force mast be delayed
until daylight
It may be of great advantage to regroup the attack forces
during the advance to the new position and launch the main
attack on another part of the front Effort is made to exploit
the moral ascendency by a quick and powerful blow before
the enemy can reconstitute his defense The action of tanks
or armored forces and combat aviation at this time may be
decisive
â¢ 558 If the enemy is fighting a delaying action on an extended
front the objective ordinarily will be attained more
quickly by concentrating on a decisive part of the front and
attacking with energy and dispatch An attack pushed deeply
and energetically through the hostile front will force the
enemy to an early evacuation of the whole front
â 559 In case of a break-through armored units penetrate
deeply into the hostile position and attack the enemy's reserves
artillery and command and signal communication
centers The gap is widened by attacking its flanks Other
mobile forces are sent through the gap to exploit the advantage
gained and to attack the enemy in rear and prevent his
escape The maximum efforts of combat aviation are concentrated
on supporting and cooperating with the forces
exploiting the break-through
560 When the attack does not reach its objective or does
not break through the hostile position during the day foot
troops intrench themselves at the points reached The night
is utilized to extend the advance Strong patrols with machine
guns are sent forward to occupy advanced positions
The foot troops advance and intrench in a new position under
the protection of these patrols Several advances of this character
may bring the troops within assaulting distance of the
hostile position These night advances must be coordinated
with the artillery and supporting combat aviation

perienced troops; to change the direction of the attack or
to extend an envelopment ; or to initiate a strong offensive
on a front where stabilization has existed
â¢ 562 When a relief is necessary warning orders are issued
by each commander (higher commander relieving unit and
unit to be relieved) to each of his subordinate units Warning
orders include : approximate hour the movement for the
relief is to begin ; zones in which relieving units are to operate
; and the restrictions imposed upon reconnaissance parties
as to size routes and hours of operation
â¢ 563 Personal reconnaissance by the commander and staff
of the relieving unit and prior conference with the commander
and staff of the relieved unit are highly desirable
When neither is possible relieving units move forward to
attack without delay reconnoitering as they go As they
move forward commanders make every effort to locate commanders
of units to be relieved
564 A plan is formulated and orders are issued covering the
movement of relieving units Fundamentally the operation is
the same as the development of a command for combat In
the preparation of the plan restrictions imposed by higher
authority because of other trafflo in the zone of advance to
relief the greater road spaces that may be required because
of increased distances between units the road net and practicability
of cross-country movement must be considered
The plan must be flexible as to times and routes of movement
The size of the unit involved and the speed with which
the relief must be conducted will govern the thoroughness
with which the details of the plan are prepared
565 In accordance with the plan of the higher commander
commanders and staffs of both the relieving and relieved
units arrange and agree upon such details as guides use of
roads fire support to be furnished by the relieved unit security

567 The plans for executing the relief must be in harmony
with the plans for continuing the attack
When the relief is executed in darkness troops relieved
are withdrawn promptly from the zone of action before the
attack is continued Artillery of the relieved unit (and frequently
other supporting weapons) may be held in position
to support the attack
When the relief is executed in daylight troops relieved
or passed through remain in position and continue the fire
support of the new unit until theix fires are masked and
until the attack has progressed far enough for the relieved
troops to be assembled and reorganized without urAue
casualties
â¢ 568 If the exact location of forward elements to be relieved
is known and if relief is effected at night the line
of departure for the attack is the line held by the forward
elements When the exact location of the most advanced
elements of unit to be relieved is unknown the line of departure
must not be forward of the line held by most advanced
elements whose location is known In daylight and
terrain permitting a line of departure between the forward
elements to be relieved and a covered position close in their
rear may be better than a line coinciding with the frontline
elements
569 To disclose the fact that a relief is in progress invites
disaster-a heavy bombardment by air and artillery a counterattack
or both at a time when congestion and traffic
circulation are doubled
2 570 In reliefs on a scale large enough to require more than
a single night troops animals and vehicles of the relieving
unit are concealed during periods of visibility The
relief is carried out by echelon To prevent the discovery of
the relief through the capture of prisoners by the enemy
during an intervening day or night front-line elements are
relieved during the last night preceding the resumption of
the attack
When the relief is made in daylight woods fog and deiilade
are utilized in the approach Smoke is placed on hostile
observation posts and hostile forward elements Mobility
ruses feints and demonstrations are exploited

57 During the course of the relief artillery maintains
its normal fires but is prepared to execute counterbattery
and protective fires along the front of the relief in the event
of a counterpreparation or of attack by the enemy
572 The principal task involved in a passage of lines is
the preparation for continuing the attack Therefore the
incoming commander must assume command of the zone of
action before his troops reach their attack positions
SECTION IV
ATTACK FROM THE DEFENSIVE
PLANNED DEFENSIVE-OFFENSIVE
573 A commander with an offensive mission may decide
to assume the defensive initially because of temporary combat
inferiority in numbers or dispositions or to create a
situation which will place the enemy at a tactical disadvantage
and offer opportunity for a decisive counteroffensive
In either case an early adoption of the offensive to attain
the objective is contemplated By inducing the enemy to
attack first the commander hopes to fix and exhaust him
and then when he is disorganized to launch the counteroffensive
This type of action demands the highest type of leadership
and tactical skill and troops with a high order of training
The major problem for the commander lies in timing the
attack
574 The selection occupation and organization of the
defensive position conform to the general doctrines discussed
in sections I and II chapter 0 except that organization of
the ground is not as complete as is required for a protracted
defense and a larger proportion of the close-combat elements
of the command are assembled concealed in a position favoring
the execution of the contemplated counteroffensive
â 575 Conduct of the defense conforms to the doctrine discussed
in section II chapter 0
As soon as the purpose of the initial defense has been accomplished
the counteroffensive is launched Thereafter
the conduct of the action is that of the attack

576-579
THE COUNTEROFFENSIVE
576 A defending force frequently has an opportunity to
adopt the offensive When a general counterattack launched
by the defender throws the attacker back following an apparently
successful advance or when a hostile attack breaks
down in front of the main line of resistance the enemy seldom
will be able to withstand a determined counteroffensive
The enemy artillery fire still may be superior but his attacking
echelon will be disorganized and signal communication
in his forward area will be disrupted If the defender seizes
the initiative and passes to an offensive before the attacker
can recover from his disorganization and can properly dispose
his reserves results often are decisive The defense must be
prepared to pass to the offensive and exploit the results of
successful defensive action

influence on the selection of position Ridges and valleys generally parallel to the front of advance constitute obstacles tothe progress of an offensive and are natural lines of resistancefor the

The present S"" howitzer used by the
U. S. Army is the Ml, a development
from the Howitzers, Mk . VI, Mk. VII
and Mk. VIII-Y2 issued to the A .E .F . during
the first World War. These howitzers
were manufactured in both England and
the United States . While they differ in
certain respects, they have the same types
of breechblocks and firing mechanisms.
8 INCH HOWITZER, MK. VI-This
howitzer is mounted on the Mk . VI carriage
. The barrel is of built-up construction,
consisting of a jacket shrunk on over
a tube. A shrunk-on breech ring carries a
lug for connecting the gun to the recoil
mechanism. A breech bushing is provided
for reception of a lever-operated breechblock
of the interrupted-screw type having
an asbestos obturator pad in the
mushroom head . Two types of noninterchangeable
firing mechanisms are utilized .
In one a T-tube friction primer inserted
in the breech is fired by means of a lanyard
pulling a friction wire out of the
tube. The other type is of the percussion
variety, in which a percussion primer fitting
into the breechblock is fired by a
lanyard-operated hammer striking a firing

the howitzer m the cradle . This howitzer
is classife I as Limited Standard .
8 INCH HOWITZER, MK. VII This
howitzer, of wire-wound construction,
was superseded by the Mk . VIII-% because
it was found necessary to thicken
the powder chamber walls to prevent
their cracking. It is classified as Limited
Standard.
s INCH HOWITZER, MK . VIII-%-This
howitzer is also of the built-up type, but
has an inner and an outer tube over which
the jacket is shrunk . No guide rings are
included, as the jacket supports the
weight of the cannon. Other details are
identical with those of the Mk . VI . This
howitzer is mounted on the Mk . VII carriage,
and is classified as Limited
Standard.
a INCH HOWITZER, M1-This weapon
is of built-up construction . The tube
screws into a breech ring fitted with lugs
for support of the breechblock carrier and
attachment of the recoil mechanism . The
carrier-supported breechblock is of the
two-cycle, interrupted-screw type . It is
equipped with a spring-actuated counterbalance,
a percussion type of firing mechanism
and an obturator mechanism . With
the exception of the spindle, pads and
other parts of the obturator, the breech
mechanisms of the 8"" Howitzer, M1, and
the 155 mm Gun, M1, are interchangeable.
This howitzer is classified as
Standard (O.C.M. 15938).
8 INCH HOWITZER PLATFORM, M1917
-When in firing position, the Mk . VII
and Mlk. VIII-Y2 howitzers rest on a demountable
firing platform buried flush
with the surface of the gound . For transport,
the platform is loaded on a twowheeled
cart attached to the howitzer
carriage. The cart and platform are each
classified as Limited Standard .
CARRIAGES, MK. VI AND MK. VII
(British)-These carriages differ mainly
in the weight and clearance of the trails,
those of the Mk. VII being raised and
strengthened to accommodate the Mk .
VIII-Y2 howitzer . The cradle rests in the
trunnion bearings of a top carriage which
is pivoted in the front transom of the
trail to permit traverse . A hydropneumatic,
long-recoil type recoil mechanism
carried by the cradle contains both the
recoil brake and the recuperator. The
trail is of the box type cut away to allow
clearance for recoil of the howitzer when
it is fired at high angles of elevation . Allsteel
wheels, 66' in diameter, with tires
12"" wide, are fitted with brakes acting
independently on each wheel . These carriages
are classified as Limited Standard .
CARRIAGE, M1-This carriage is identical
in design and construction with the
155 mm Gun Carriage, Ml . Since the howitzer
is considerably heavier than the gun,
it is necessary to increase the nitrogen
pressure in the howitzer recoil mechanism,
M4. The howitzer remains in the battery
position during transport. This carriage is
classified as Standard (O.C.M. 15938).

37 MM GUN M6-STANDARD FOR TANKS
The 37 mm tank guns were developed
from the 37 mm Antitank Gun, M3,
the first model being the 37 mm Tank
Gun, M5. Addition of an automatically
opened breechblock changed the designation
to the M6, standardized by
O.C.M. 16279 dated 14 Nov. 1940 . The
\15 barrel is shorter by about 5 inches
than the barrels of the other guns .
The 37 mm Gun, M6, is standard for
use on Light Tanks, M3A1, M3A3, M5
and \;15A1 on Medium Tank, M3, and
its variations, and on the 37 mm Light
Armored Car, M8. The gun is carried on
the M23, M24 or M44 Mount.
The barrel is a one-piece forging or
casting with a rifled bore, threaded to
screw into the breech ring . Two bearings
support the barrel and align it in the yoke
of the sleigh. Keys are employed to prevent
rotation of the barrel.
The breech ring is broached to receive
the drop-type breechblock . A breechoperating
mechanism is bolted to the
recoil cylinder. Recoil of the gun automatically
opens the breechblock, extracts
the empty cartridge case, locks the breech
in an open position and cocks the gun .
Rounds are inserted into the breech
manually.
The recoil cylinder is assembled with
the trunnion pins mounted in the trunnions
of the yoke . It is provided with rails to
guide the sleigh and contains a recoil
mechanism of the hydrospring type, the
counter-recoil spring, and a buffer mechanism.
In tanks with power traverse the gun
is fired by a solenoid-firing device connected
with the trigger . In other cases
the hand-operated trigger actuator causes
the firing process to start .
The gun may be elevated by a handwheel,
but a throw-out lever permits free
movement of the weapon .
Traverse of guns mounted in tanks with
power-traversing mechanisms is obtained
by power-drive rotation of the turret . In
tanks equipped with manually operated
turrets only, the gun can be traversed
10' right or left by means of a traversing
knob. When greater traverse is necessary
the turret must be rotated or the tank
turned in direction .
A shield is attached to the yoke and
recoil cylinder by bolts, or, in some tanks,
direct to the turret.

75 MM HOWITZER M3-MOUNT W-STANDARD
The decision to adapt the Pack Howitzer,
M1 or M1A1, for use in the Howitzer
Motor Carriage, M8, necessitated spot
welding and keying a tube mounting
support in place over the howitzer tube .
This mounting support increased the
outside diameter of the tube to fit the
central bore of the cradle. Pack howitzer
tubes modified in this manner were
designated Howitzers, M2 . They are now
classified as Substitute Standard .
Since there were insufficient M2 tubes
to supply the required number of howitzer
motor carriages, new tubes were made
with the howitzer mounting support
integral with the tube . These tubes were
given the designation of 75 mm Howitzer,
M3, and classified as Standard .
Howitzers, M2 and M3, are manually
loaded weapons fired electrically by
means of a solenoid, or manually by a
hand firing mechanism handle . The tube
assembly differs from that of the M1 or
M1A1 Howitzers only in the hoop at the
rear end of the mounting support on the
M2 and in the flash detector which is
integral with the howitzer shield in both
the M2 and M3 models.
The tube is screwed into a breech
ring containing a breechblock of the
horizontal sliding wedge type . A recoil
tube retainer, which provides the means
of attaching the two recoil cylinder
assemblies to the tube assembly, is
bolted to a breech yoke support on the
tube.
The tube assembly is supported and
alined in a cradle which is a part of the
mount assembly. The tube mounting
support, which is finish-ground, rides in
liners inside the cradle .
The Firing Lock, M13, fits into an
axial hole in the breechblock . It is of
the continuous-pull, self-cocking type,
and is retained in position by sector lugs
on its exterior which engage with lugs in
the breechblock .
The hydrospring recoil mechanism
consists of two recoil cylinders, one on
each side of the howitzer, which arc held
and located in the cradle . A counter-
75 mm HOWITZER, M3
recoil buffer is attached to the front
cover of each cylinder.
Howitzers, M2 and M3, are mounted in
75 mm Howitzer Mount, M7, which rests
on trunnions in the turret of the Howitzer
Motor Carriage, M8. The mount assembly
is composed of a cradle with two
recoil cylinders, a firing mechanism, and
a recoil guard . The shield is attached to
the forward end of the cradle and is
elevated and depressed with it. Rotation
of the howitzer is prevented by a key in
the cradle which rides in a groove in the
howitzer tube mounting support .
The firing mechanism is mounted on
the rear end of the recoil guard . An electrical
system is provided for primary use,
with current supplied by the vehicle
battery. The system operates electrically
from a firing button, activating the electromagnetic
solenoid, and then through a
mechanical series of linkages to a trigger
chain hooked directly to the trigger . A
hand firing system, which may be employed
in case of failure of the elevation
system, is operated by the hand firing
mechanism handle and utilizes the mechanical
linkage of the electrical firing
system .
A recoil guard of tubular framework
with right and left shields surrounds the
breech. It is attached to the cradle and
acts as a support for the electrical firing
mechanism.
Elevation is accomplished by means of
an elevating mechanism mounted on the
right rear wall of the turret . A train of
gears inside the elevating mechanism
case connects with a pinion that meshes
with the elevating quadrant rack on the
howitzer cradle . The elevating mechanism
is operated by a handwheel which
may be engaged with or disengaged from
the gear train by means of a shifter lever
and a sliding gear .
Traverse is obtained by rotating the
turret . A liandwheel operates a gear train
and a pinion meshed with the traversing
rack bolted to the under side of the turret
roof. A traversing lock is provided to
lock the turret in traveling position .

75 MM GUN M3 STANDARD FOR TANKS
75 mm GUN, M3, SHOWING TUBE, BREECH RING, COCKING LEVER, CLOSING SPRING CYLINDER AND OPERATING HANDLE
The 75 mm - Gun, M3, a development
from the Tank Gun, M2, was standardized
by O.C.M. 17018, dated 24 July
1941 . The M2 gun is now designated as
Limited Standard .
The i113 gun is a single-shot, flat-trajectory
weapon differing from the M2
only in having the tube lengthened by
26.6', with a higher muzzle velocity and
greater range as a result. It is equipped
with a drop-type breechblock automatically
opened . This weapon is mounted in
Medium Tanks, M4, M4A1, M4A2,
M4A3, M4A4, and in Medium Tank, M7,
using Mounts, M34, M34A1 and M47 .
The alloy steel tube screws into the
breech ring, where it is locked into position
with a key . The breech ring contains
the vertical sliding breechblock assembly
and the principal operating parts of the
gun. The breech mechanism is composed
of the breechblock assembly, firing mechanism,
extractors, spline shaft, breechblock
crank, operating crank, closing
mechanism and related parts . A hole
bored through the center of the breechblock
houses the percussion mechanism .
Drc-r --
The breech may be opened by means of
an operating handle secured to the spline
shaft.
Manual loading of each round automatically
closes the block. The gun can
be fired either manually or by means of
a solenoid. During counterrecoil after
firing, the gun is cocked, the block is
opened, the cartridge case is extracted
and the breechblock is locked in an open
position for insertion of the next round .
The gun recoils in the mount, which
consists of a horizontal rotor upon which
is mounted the elevating mechanism and
traversing mechanism; the hydraulic recoil
mechanism, supported by trunnions
which rotate in the trunnion seats of the
horizontal rotor ; an elevating shield,
bolted to the trunnions of the recoil
mechanism and projecting through an
opening in the rotor ; two recoil cylinders,
held by the cradle and trunnion assembly
upon which are mounted the solenoid, firing
lever link, and firing lever of the firing
mechanism; and a shoulder guard, bolted
to the cradle, covering the firing mechanism
and extending beyond the rear face
of the breech.

76 MM TANK GUN, M1AI. THE M1A2 DIFFERS FROM THE M1A1 ONLY IN HAVING
THE MUZZLE END THREADED FOR ATTACHMENT OF A MUZZLE BRAKE
The 76 mm Gun, M1A2, is a modification
of the MI Gun of the same
caliber . The original 76 mm Gun, M1,
was designed to provide tank weapons of
greater power and armor penetration than
were possible with 75 mm armament.
76 mm GUN, M1-This gun was designed
to use the 3"" H .E. Shell or A .P.C.
Projectile with a different cartridge case .
The gun tube and extractors were constructed
to accommodate the redesigned
cartridge, but the breech ring and breech
mechanism were similar to those used on
the 75 mm Gun, M3 . This 76 mm Gun,
M1, is now Limited Standard .
76 mm GUN, MIAI-In order to better
adapt the MI Gun to use with various
tanks and gun motor carriages, the contour
of the tube was changed, and the
recoil slide surface on the tube was
The 3"" Gun, M7, was designed for use
in Heavy Tanks, M6 and M6A1 . It
was also adopted as standard armament
for the 3' Gun Motor Carriage, M10 .
Ammunition for this weapon is the same
as that for the 3"" antitank and antiaircraft
guns .
O.C.M. 16200, dated 24 October 1940,
initiated the development of a 3' gun
similar to 3"" Gun, T9, for the Heavy
Tank, T1 . It was designated 3"" Gun, T12,
with interior dimensions and ballistics
practically identical with those of the 3""
Antiaircraft Gun, M3, and the 3"" Antitank
Gun, 1%15 . After firing tests, the T12
was standardized as 3' Gun, M7, by
O.C .M. 18467, dated 9 July 1942 .
The 3"" Gun, M7, is a high-velocity,
manually loaded weapon employing a
semi-automatic breech mechanism with a
lengthened 12 inches, thus permitting
the trunnion position to be set farther
forward to obtain better balance . The
M1 gun with these modifications was
designated 76 mm Gun, M1A1, and is
classified as Limited Standard .
76 mm GUN, MIA2-In the 76 mm
Gun, M1A2, the rifling twist is one turn
in 32 calibers instead of one turn in 40
calibers as in the M1 and M1A1 Guns .
All tubes are threaded at the muzzle to
allow assembly of a muzzle brake, and a
ring is provided to cover the threaded
portion of the tube when the muzzle
brake is not in place. This gun is classified
as Standard.

LAUNCHER, ROCKET, ANTITANK, 2.36 INCH, Y--STANDARD f
The rocket launcher, popularly known
and widely publicized as the ""Bazooka,""
represents the adaptation to
modern warfare of one of the oldest forms
of military pyrotechnics, the rocket . It
represents, too, the first practical development
of a rocket gun or rocket launcher
as a shoulder weapon for infantry use
against tanks and other armored targets .
The launcher is an open tube approximately
54 inches long and 2 .365 inches
in internal diameter equipped with a
shoulder stock, a pistol grip, electrical
firing mechanism, and sights . The Rocket,
M6A3, is 19.4 inches long and weighs
3.38 pounds. It carries a shaped charge
of TNT capable of penetrating heavy
armor at angles of impact up to 30Â°. The
optimum range is approximately 200
yards although the rocket may be em-
424 11I6AlIIIRIp
ROCKET LAUNCHER, M9,-BROKEN DOWN
ROCKET LAUNCHER, A.T., M9, LEFT SIDE
ployed at ranges as great as 600 yards .
The Rocket, 2 .36 inch, M6A3, is illustrated
and described in the ammunition
section of this catalogue.
In its original form the rocket launcher
was supplied with a wooden shoulder
stock midway of its length and was not
reinforced for additional bore-safety .
A two-cell dry battery supplied the spark
for ignition of the rocket's propelling
charge, pressure on the trigger completing
the circuit.
The first models of the launcher were
equipped with a hinged rear sight and
fixed front sights . These were followed
by a peep rear sight and a front sight in
the form of a rectangular frame at the
muzzle of the launcher. The vertical
sides of the frame carried graduations
for ranges of 100, 200, and 300 yards .
The rocket launcher was introduced
as a combat weapon during the North
African campaign of 1942-43 . Use in
battle indicated the need for various
improvements and for a model which
could be broken down into two approximately
equal loads for use by parachute
troops . The present launcher, M9, represents
the development of those tactical
requirements .
Since a higher safety factor was required,
the tube of the launcher is now
wrapped with wire around all that portion
adjacent to the operator's face. The
skeleton stock is of metal and is shaped
so as to permit two shoulder positions
for ease of sighting at high and low
elevations and for prone shooting . Midway
of the tube is a flange with bayonet
joints which breaks the launcher into
sections which may be carried by paratroopers
or packed into containers for
aerial delivery . Reassembly can be
effected in a few seconds without tools
and the joint locked rigidly.
The dry cells which supplied the ignition
spark in the earlier models have been
replaced -by a self-contained magneto
operated by pressure on the ""squeezer""
type trigger. A one-way safety switch
incorporated in the trigger mechanism
cuts out the magneto and prevents generation
of an electrical impulse as the
trigger returns to position .
The sight is an optical ring hinged to
fold against the tube when not in use
and protected by a cover. An adjustable
range scale provides graduations from
50 to 700 yards in 50-yard increments .
Assembled and ready for firing, the
rocket launcher measures 55 inches overall
and weighs approximately 14%
pounds.

LIGHT TANKS
Light tanks are those which weigh 20 tons or less . By this
definition even the Japanese so-called medium tanks and the German
Pzlcw III medium taxik fall into this class .
AU early light tanks were armed with 3
guns . The Germans
ave mounted a 50mm and a short-barreled 75 -.eapon in their latest
light tanks, whereas the now U. S. Light Tank, 24, mounts a 75mm
cannon. The Japanese have used a short-barreled 57ma gun in their
Model 97 tank and a 47mm tank gun with a higher velocity in their
latest model (2597 Special) .

"nk. We passed through the Regimental
Reconnaissance Platoon . We had artillery to
our right rear. No one told us that they were
coming through. I think I was the first one to
give them the word that they were coming .
They came out of the hill southwest of Sidi
bou Zid. I gave the warning, but our people
didn't do anything that I know of . Then I got
the artillery observer . The tanks were then
300 yards away. I know of only 3 artillery
shells that fell on our right. I lost my recon-
33
naissance car and came out in a peep that
night. I brought 9 men out with me .
I can't understand why there was no artillery
fire, as the tanks were perfect targetsmassed
30 feet apart. Possibly no communication.
The Germans clean the battlefield of
everything. At Medjes-el-Bab the Germans
cleaned up, after darkness, only 800 yards
away. We found only burned out tanks and
wheels the next morning. The German recovery
crew was joined by the returning tank
crews, who signal each other with flares . The
tank crews assisted die recovery crews in locating
and pulling in damaged equipment .
The Germans also use flare signals in locating
stuff at night .
We got one of the boys back yesterday
that was burned and had been in the hospital .
He got burned in the battle of Sbeitla-SERGEANT

SERGEANT HAGLER: He is a good boy. His

I had to wait a week for some tank

was the toughest road march I ever made .
LIEUTENANT PARKER: It's embarrassing to
have to go up for information under fire and
then have to go back under fire and then go
up for more information again. The most
favorable place to hide is in the defilades to
get the information.

At Medjez-el-Bab there was little or no

*NOTE: Maintenance became the subject of
the conversation . Everyone talked at once and earnestly
about 'salvaging' spare parts from abandoned
vehicles. The scribe could not keep up . Talking
about a race to get to a certain abandoned, disabled,
American tank, one exclaimed, ' hrist, someone beat
me to that one; homelite gone, radio gone, we had
tried to beat the Ordnance to it, damn it .'
Another stated, 'My crews go back with the
tanks to the Ordnance and they keep a guard with
a Tommy gun posted to see that no one gets away
by mistake with even a single wrench from it . We
have to have all our equipment and the men look
out and see that they do have it and don't lose anything.

seniors while ORs will continue to march at ease. If, for instance, a party
of engineers are working on a roadside, I do not expect that every time an

is that troops like saluting if it is done properly and if the custom is properly
explained to them. I lay stress on what seems to be little things. Little
things are important in battle. In battle men risk lives. You cant get them

OPERATION SPRING
by G.G. Simonds, Lieut.-General
G.O.C.
Canadian Forces in the Netherlands
31 January 1946
Whilst I agree with the proposed text of the statement of the Minister
of National Defence, I have the following comments to make which may
help to a better understanding of the background of operation Spring.
Of all the operations of the war the holding attack is that least
understood by the layman for casualties seem to be out of all proportion to
apparent gains. It is also, for the same reasons, the most trying for a
commander and his troops. Yet to achieve great and decisive results against
a skilful enemy, the hostile reserves must be drawn in, pinned and worn
down before the real coup-de-grace can be delivered. In all military
history, to force an able commander to expend his reserves there has been
discovered no alternative to the holding attack. To effect its purpose,
such an attack must be directed against an objective about which the enemy
is highly sensitive and for the protection of which he is certain to react. In
the Normandy bridgehead the Caen Hinge was just such an objective and
it was inherent in the operational conditions of mid-July that any attack
directed against it would meet violent opposition and consequent heavy
fighting.
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
50
Normandy: The July Battles
51
Conditions at the time of operation Totalize  the breakthrough
south of Caen  were very different from those at the time of operation
Spring. Between the 25 July and 7 Aug the Germans had to shift reserves
to meet the American breakout at Avranches and the advance of 12 British
Corps of Second Army towards the upper Orne had forced a further
reduction of the German strength south of Caen. In my original
appreciation and outline plan for operation Totalize, I considered a
breakthrough contingent upon these conditions and I stated:
The plan is submitted on the assumption that the right wing of Second
Army has secured, or imminently threatens to secure, a bridgehead east of
the R. Orne, thus loosening the enemy grip on his northern pivot.
As is now well known, the plan of the C.-in-C. F.M. (then General)
Montgomery, was to draw in and pin the enemy on the latters sensitive
eastern flank thus creating a situation favourable to the break out on the
western flank. Every formation in the Anglo-Canadian Armies had to bear
its share in the series of holding attacks on the eastern end of the
bridgehead. The task was to draw the German armoured strength east of the
Orne and to hold it there until the American attack at Avranches gained
momentum. This was successfully achieved and the troops who bore the
brunt of the heavy, unspectacular fighting south of Caen deserve just as
much credit for the final result as do those who made the obvious gains at
the other extremity of the front. General Eisenhower gave this as his own
view in a public statement, which I know to be sincere.
The Objective
The ultimate objective for operation Spring was the high ground
north of Cintheaux  the key to the German main defence system south of
Caen and a necessary stepping stone to our advance down the Caen-Falaise
road. Based upon enemy strength as known prior to the attack, the
attainment of the objective was feasible and the attack might open an
opportunity for deeper exploitation.
There were two alternative approaches for the attack  astride the
Caen-Falaise road or on the axis Soliers-Bourguebus. In the latter case the
left flank was very exposed and the left wing of the assault would have to
move over ground offering no cover. More important still, a partial success
on this line of attack would not improve our tactical position. An attack
astride the Caen-Falaise road had its right flank exposed to fire from enemy
positions on the west bank of the Orne, but the built up area St. Andre-surOrne
 May-sur-Orne offered a good deal of cover and even a partial
success astride this axis would give us the very important Verrieres ridge. I
therefore decided to attack astride the Caen-Falaise road. It was later, in
operation Totalize, that the breakthrough was made along this same axis.
Timing
In operation Atlantic, carried out in conjunction with 8 British Corps
operation Goodwood, 2 Canadian Corps had gained the initial bridgehead
east of the Orne opposite Caen. At the end of this operation we held the
northern reverse slopes of the Verrieres ridge. From the crest of the ridge
the Germans overlooked nearly the whole of the bridgehead on the east
bank of the Orne. The deployment for any major attack had to be done in
darkness. With troops which had not much battle experience it was, in my
opinion, essential to give them as much time as it was possible to allow, for
forming-up. Deployment could not start until after dark and it was equally
important in my mind that the timing of the attack should be such that we
should be in possession of the crest of the Verrieres ridge before daylight.
These conditions left very little latitude in the choice of H hour.
Support
The assault was launched under support of a very heavy field and
medium artillery barrage with superimposed concentrations on known
centres of resistance.
Assessment of the Operation
I find analysis of an operation like the attack of the Black Watch at
May-sur-Orne a most distasteful task for it means criticism of some, who,
whatever mistakes they made, made them in good faith and paid the
supreme sacrifice in the course of their duty.
In view of the eleventh hour reinforcement of the German positions
east of the Orne, as revealed in the early stages of the attack, there will be
doubt whether the original objective was attainable. In the forenoon I made
the decision not to launch the two armoured divisions but I ordered
7 Armoured Division forward to reinforce the success of 4 Cdn Inf Bde and
to make certain that the important gain of the Verrieres ridge was not lost.
The capture of the ridge in operation Spring established the firm base
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
52
Normandy: The July Battles
53
which later made possible the mounting of operation Totalize under much
more favourable conditions.
I have stated above that in face of enemy strength as revealed by the
attack there will be doubt as to whether the original final objective was
attainable. The whole plan was fully discussed with and approved by
General Dempsey, G.O.C.-in-C. Second Army (under which 2 Canadian
Corps was operating) both before and after the operation. I considered at
the time (and I have found no evidence since to change my view) that the
objectives of May-sur-Orne, Verrieres and Tilly-la-Campaigne could and
should have been taken and held without heavy casualties and that in the
event, the casualties of certain units were excessive. That we failed to
capture and hold May-sur-Orne and Tilly-la-Campaigne and that we
suffered what were, in my opinion, excessive casualties was due to a series
of mistakes and errors in judgment in minor tactics.
I do not express the above view with the object of directing criticism
on officers, some of whom lost their lives in this action or later. I would
prefer not to make a statement and certainly not be quoted in this
connection at this time, but as a matter of historical record, when this
operation can be examined in all its aspects, I feel under an obligation to
express my frank opinion.
I have introduced many divisions into their first battles  Canadian,
British, American and Polish  and I am convinced that no amount of
training can compensate for actual battle experience. It seems that nothing
but the actual experience of battle will forcibly imprint on mens minds the
great importance of certain tactical measures, no matter how often they
have been reiterated in training. On many occasions in summing up on
training exercises, and as final reminders on visiting units on their arrival in
the bridgehead, I personally emphasized the great importance of:-
(a) The security of the start-line before an attack.
(b) The necessity of closely following artillery supporting fire.
(c) The importance of mopping-up which required a detailed
search of the ground.
(d) The quick establishment of a firm base to meet the inevitable
counter-attack.
Non-observance of some or all of the above tactical measures was in
my opinion the cause of failure to secure initial objectives and of
unnecessary casualties in operation Spring.
Security of the Start Line
In mobile operations there is no continuous front but a firm base is
established on a series of pivotal localities. Between these localities both
sides are free to patrol  especially during darkness. The best German
troops were always very aggressive and good at this patrolling. Therefore,
before an attack it was essential to patrol the area forward of the start line
to ensure that German patrols had not been infiltrated between the forward
localities, and having made certain the area was clear, to station strong
standing patrols to prevent hostile patrols from penetrating and interfering
with the forming-up of assaulting troops. In operation Spring though
mobile patrols were sent out and reported the start line clear, certain units
did not leave standing patrols on the ground to cover deployment. In fact,
German patrols did penetrate and this was the cause of some confusion
during deployment and delay on the part of some units in crossing their start
line.
The Necessity of Closely Following Artillery Supporting Fire
With good troops in field defences the neutralizing effect of the most
intense artillery supporting fire is only temporary. The better the troops the
quicker is the recovery following the cessation of shelling. It is therefore
most important that the assaulting troops should cross the start line on time
and press home the assault on each successive objective immediately
covering fire lifts. Some latitude is allowed by arranging for a barrage to
dwell for a specified number of minutes on the opening line, but if this
pause is prolonged it gives the enemy warning of the direction and frontage
of attack. From my appreciation of events at the time, I am certain in my
own mind that there was a period during the attack on the morning of 25
July when May-sur-Orne could have been entered and cleared without
heavy casualties. Owing to inexperience and failure to appreciate the vital
importance of time and how fleeting are such opportunities, the favourable
period was allowed to pass unexploited.
The Importance of Thorough Mopping-Up
This is perhaps the hardest of all lessons to teach other than by
experience. Until the soldier has actually witnessed it, it is hard to realize
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
54
Normandy: The July Battles
55
the complete absence of obvious evidence of the presence of the enemy in
an area which he may actually hold in considerable strength. The best
German troops were very clever at concealment and also knew the value of
withholding fire so as not to disclose their positions too early. When a
hostile locality was entered under supporting covering fire, it was necessary
to properly organize at once a detailed search of the area to clear out the
lurking enemy. The various reports that May-sur-Orne was cleared by
troops who had penetrated well into the village, showed that this detailed
search had never been properly organized and thorough.
It has been a source of deep regret to me that a fine battalion like the
Black Watch suffered so heavily in this attack. I would prefer to make no
statement on the subject for I dislike even suggesting criticism of those who
lost their lives, but if a statement is required from me as a matter of record,
I consider that the losses were unnecessarily heavy and the results achieved
disappointing. Such heavy losses were not inherent in the plan nor in its
intended execution. The action of the Black Watch was most gallant but
was tactically unsound in its detailed execution.

CHAPTER 3
Totalize and Tractable
The American breakthrough at St. Lô transformed the battle of Normandy,
requiring Montgomery, as commander of the land forces, to make one of
the most important decisions of his career. He decided to reinforce success
by shifting the weight of 2nd British Army to the American flank and join Bradley
in pushing the German army back to the Seine; pressing on a swinging door rather
than trying to break the hinge on the hills south of Caen. He cancelled the series
of left-right-left blows to be delivered on either side of the Orne and ordered
Dempsey to shift 2nd British Army to the Caumont sector to launch Operation
Bluecoat.1
Montgomery believed that the enemy could not afford to weaken his
positions south of Caen because a breakthrough there would trap most of the
German forces in Normandy. He ordered First Canadian Army, now responsible
for the sector from the Orne to the sea, to draw up plans for an actual attack Caen-
Falaise, but noted on 29 July, no large-scale effort was required immediately.2
Montgomery then transferred 3rd British Division and 8th British Armoured
Brigade to 2nd British Army leaving Crerar with four infantry divisions and one
armoured brigade to hold the long left flank. Crerar ordered I British Corps by
positive action and deception to persuade the enemy that an advance towards
Vimont was in preparation while 2nd Canadian Corps employed similar methods
to suggest that an advance to Falaise was imminent.3
As the Caumont offensive gained momentum, von Kluge ordered 9th SS
Panzer Division west to join the rest of II SS Panzer Corps in blocking the British
advance. By 1 August there were four Panzer divisions on the American front,
three facing the British, and just two (1st SS and 12th SS) left east of the Orne.
This situation cried out for a major attack in the Caen sector to cut off the Germans
west of the Orne, but both Montgomery and Eisenhower were still convinced the
Germans would begin a retreat to the Seine pivoting on a strong hinge south of
Caen.4 Fortunately for the Allies, Hitler intervened, ordering von Kluge to cut off
Pattons Third Army at Avranches. This decision ended any possibility of reestablishing
a new and continuous main line of resistance; it also doomed the
German armies in Normandy to destruction no matter what strategy the Allies
pursued.
Montgomerys concept of future operations had not changed on 4 August,
when he issued a new directive. The enemy front, he declared, is now in such
a state that it could be made to disintegrate completely. The First Canadian Army
was ordered to join a general offensive to gain such ground in the direction of
Falaise as will cut off the enemy now facing 2nd Army. With the Americans
advancing to Alençon, British 8th Corps to Argentan, 30th Corps to Thury-
Harcourt, and 12th Corps clearing the west bank of the Orne, the Canadians were
to help force the enemy back across the Seine by a carefully staged advance
toward Falaise.5
Simonds had begun studying the problems of mounting such an operation
on 29 July. The lessons learned in Operation SPRING were very much on his
mind, and in his first Appreciation he outlined new ideas for overcoming the
German defences. The ground he noted:
is ideally suited to the full exploitation by the enemy of the
characteristics of his weapons. It is open, giving little cover to
either infantry or tanks and the long range of his anti-tank guns
and mortars, firing from carefully concealed positions, provides a
very strong defence in depth. This defence will be most
handicapped in bad visibility, smoke, fog or darkness, when the
advantage of long range is minimized.6 (The full document is
reproduced below.)
Simonds decided on a night attack, as in SPRING. But this time he
proposed to use heavy bombers to neutralize the enemy defences and armour to
get through the enemy gun screen in sufficient depth to disrupt the German
defences. The tanks were to be accompanied by carrier-born infantry, which he
proposed to mount in stripped Priests, the self-propelled M7s, which 3rd Division
gunners had just traded in for the standard, towed 25-pounder guns.
When Simonds first described his intentions for Operation TOTALIZE, he
spoke of a breakthrough with Falaise as the objective.7 His outline plan was far
more cautious. The operation was to take place in three distinct phases. Phase 1
would be a night break-in supported by heavy bombers, which would bring the
2nd Canadian and 51st Highland divisions through the first German defence line
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
58
Totalize and Tractable
on Verrières Ridge. Phase 2, a daylight attack on the next ridgeline, Hautmesnil-
St-Sylvain, was to be led by 4th Armoured Division with the 3rd in support.
Simonds believed that a second massive strike by heavy bombers would be
required, even though many of the enemy positions in the fallback zone, created
on Rommels orders, were currently unoccupied. Phase 3 would require the Polish
Armoured Division, which was to join the corps on 5 August, to parallel 4th
Divisions advance to the high ground north of Falaise.8
This outline plan was based on accurate intelligence about enemy
dispositions on 31 July. Simonds believed that with both 1st SS and 9th SS
divisions holding the forward defences, the main battle would be fought in Phase
1, and that Phase 2 would involve dealing with counter-attacks from 12th SS,
which was in close reserve. Simonds was careful to integrate his plan with British
operations on his flanks. Another attack on Verrières Ridge while the enemy held
the high ground west of the Orne would have to be avoided. TOTALIZE, he
insisted, would only work if the 2nd British Army had secured or was close to
securing a bridgehead across the Orne, thus loosening the enemy grip on his
Northern pivot.9
On 2 August Simonds learned that 9th SS Panzer Division had withdrawn
a sizable battle group including tanks from the Canadian front. The next day he
received confirmation that Sepp Dietrichs I SS Panzer Corps was now reduced to
two Panzer divisions. By the morning of 5 August, evidence of further changes in
the enemy order of battle,10 and reports that 12th British Corps was about to cross
the Orne, led Simonds to order units holding the line to seize the villages on
Verrières Ridge. Attacks on la Hogue, Tilly, and May-sur-Orne were repulsed
with significant losses, demonstrating that the ridge was still strongly held.
Prisoners of war, captured during the night, reported that a new infantry division,
the 89th, was relieving 1st SS, which was said to be withdrawing to Brettevillesur-
Laize to form a mobile reserve.11
The next morning Simonds decided to radically revise his plans for
TOTALIZE. He seems to have believed that 89th Division would be a much less
formidable opponent than an SS Panzer division, and to have concluded that the
major battle would occur at the Bretteville-sur-Laize position, where tanks and
infantry are most likely to be encountered.12 He now proposed to attack this area
with both armoured divisions, and to require those divisions to continue south to
their final objectives without pausing to reorganize.13 It was this analysis that
informed his decision to retain the use of heavy bombers in Phase 2.
The significance of these changes would become fully apparent only after
the battle had been joined, but Simonds and his commanders certainly knew that
59
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND

the choke point in the initial plan was the narrow gap between Cintheaux and
Robertmesnil, a distance of less than 3 kilometres. In the original plan, 4th
Division was to deploy on both sides of the Caen-Faliase highway; now it was
restricted to the west side of the road, where the gap of less than 1500 metres
was dominated by the substantial stone-walled village of Cintheaux. The Poles,
to the east, had slightly more room to manoeuvre, but the scattered woods south
of Robertmesnil provided perfect cover for anti-tank guns and armour.
Simonds hoped that the bombing program arranged for Phase 2 would
neutralize the enemy defences in this area. In a 1947 lecture to British officers
studying TOTALIZE on the ground in Normandy, Simonds recalled that he had
originally planned to go through the very narrow gap with one armoured
division, but when it appeared that the layback position [Hautmesnil  St
Sylvain] was held in greater strength he decided in order to save time to launch
the two divisions together with their tails organized behind them ready to fan out
as they came through the gap.14
Saving time seemed especially important on 6 August because the Allied
commanders now believed, in Montgomerys words, that the enemy was falling
back, unwillingly, to some new line. There was no indication yet of where the
line might be, but he is definitely trying to pivot on the Caen area. The enemy,
Montgomery wrote, would be in an awkward situation if he lost his positions
astride the Falaise road and if he lost Falaise itself. Montgomery, influenced
by the news that 12th Corps was across the Orne just north of Thury-Harcourt,
assigned the capture of Falaise to the Second British Army and ordered the
Canadians to attack toward Falaise. If Falaise was secured it was to be handed
over to the Second Army. The Canadians were then to turn northeast and advance
to the Seine on the axis Lisieux-Rouen.15 That night, reports from Ultra of a major
German offensive at Mortain were decrypted,16 and for the first time, Allied
commanders began to think about encircling the German armies rather than
pushing them back to the Seine. Operation TOTALIZE was to be transformed
from an attack designed to assist the Second British Army, into the wing of vast
pincer movement, but no new resources were allocated to carry out this much
more ambitious task.
For the corps and divisional staff officers, the greatest challenge posed by
TOTALIZE was traffic control. The Phase 1 divisions occupied a wide area north
of Verrières-Tilly line, and the two armoured divisions had to be kept out of the
way. Both were, however, supposed to move forward by the morning of 8 August,
with 3rd Division following the Poles across the Orne bridges.17 So long as
everything went smoothly, these moves could be made within the rigid timings
laid down in the operational orders. But no one could remember the last time
Totalize and Tractable
things had gone according to plan.
The most complex part of TOTALIZE was the artillery fire plan
developed under the supervision of Brigadier Bruce Matthews, the Corps
Commander Royal Artillery (CCRA). Operational Instruction No. 5, issued at
0900 hours on 7 August, outlined the tasks to be carried out by the divisional field
regiments and the four Artillery Groups Royal Artillery (AGRAs) allotted to
TOTALIZE. There was to be no preliminary artillery program, so a great deal of
attention was paid to counter-battery tasks scheduled for H + 100 minutes, when
the assault would be underway, and H + 7 hours, when dawn would provide the
enemy with visibility. The Service Corps was to ensure that 350 rounds per gun
were dumped at medium gun positions and that up to 650 rounds per gun were
available to the field regiments.18
Simonds had orchestrated one of the most remarkable operations of the
war. On both sides of the Caen-Falaise highway, hundreds of armoured vehicles,
marshalled into columns, were advancing over the crest of the ridge. Each
column, four vehicles abreast, was led by a gapping force composed of two troops
of Shermans, two troops of mine-clearing flail tanks, and a troop of armoured
engineer vehicles (AVREs) to mark the route with tapes and lights. Next came the
assault force led by Sherman tanks, followed by elements of an infantry battalion
riding in unfrocked priests or universal carriers. Mortars, medium machine
guns, self-propelled and towed anti-tank guns, bulldozers, and finally more tanks,
known as the fortress force, which were to guard the dispersal area and form a
firm base, completed each phalanx.19
With the rest of 12th SS assembling in obedience to Hitlers orders to join
in a renewed attack at Mortain, the forces opposing the first phase of TOTALIZE
were effectively reduced to the 89th and 272nd Infantry Divisions. The 272nd
covered the eastern flank, including la Hogue and the high ground at Secqueville;
the 89th was responsible for the 8000 metres stretching west towards the Orne.
The 272nd was all too familiar with the kind of attrition warfare waged by the
Allies, but the 89th, which had trained in Norway before joining 15th Army in the
Rouen area, had never been in action as a unit, though most of the officers and
NCOs were veterans of the Eastern Front. Once established in France, General
Heinrichs, an experienced infantry officer, supervised intensive training with
emphasis on support weapons. The 89th was a pocket division composed of two
infantry regiments each of three battalions, but it also included a Fusilier battalion
as a divisional reserve, a full-strength engineer battalion, an artillery regiment, and
three anti-tank companies including the one equipped with 88s.20
The 89th relieved 1st SS Panzer Division on the night of 6 August
61
without exceptional difficulty. The troops were told they were facing not
particularly highly trained Canadians, who were holding the line with armoured
divisions behind them.21 The 1055th Grenadier Regiment took over the carefully
prepared positions at Tilly-la-Campagne and Rocquancourt, with one battalion in
reserve at St-Aignan. The 1056th Regiment deployed two battalions up around
May and Fontenay, with a third battalion at Caillouet. Heinrichs placed his
headquarters at a quarry near Bretteville-sur-Laize and established a second antitank
gun screen level with the divisional command post. The Fusilier battalion
was positioned just east of Bretteville. Contact was established with the flanking
formations, 1st SS Panzer Corps headquarters, and the mortar brigade stationed to
the rear of the divisional sector. The Luftwaffe regiments of the Flak Corps, with
their dual-purpose 88s, were much too grand to communicate with a mere division
and operated independently throughout the battles of August. The same was true
for Kurt Meyer and the 12th SS, which functioned as the corps reserve, with
minimal contact with Heinrichs and his officers.22 Accounts of TOTALIZE that
rely on Meyers postwar interviews, have neglected the role of 89th Division and
ignored the reality that the defence of the Caen sector was directed by Sepp
Dietrich and the headquarters of 1st SS Panzer Corps. Dietrich had two infantry
divisions, a mortar brigade, the corps artillery, and the Luftwaffe flak regiments,
as well as 12th SS, under command.
The bombing that preceded the ground attack failed to have any serious
impact on the enemy, but the dust raised by the explosions and the craters that
pitted the landscape interfered with the progress of the attacking troops. When the
armoured columns topped the crest of the ridge, airborne particles and ground mist
and dust thrown up by the vehicles limited visibility to a few feet. Slight detours,
taken inadvertently or to avoid craters, led to so much confusion that only one of
the four Canadian columns followed the assigned route east of Rocquancourt. All
accounts of the first hours of TOTALIZE describe a confused situation that
almost, but never quite, collapsed into chaos. In the end, most of the isolated
groups and single vehicles worked their way forward, overcoming or avoiding
enemy fire.
At his tactical headquarters Simonds was attempting to co-ordinate the
Phase 2 advance of his two armoured divisions with the bomber attack on the
enemys secondary defensive position. Simonds had always insisted the
bombardment, to be carried out by the 8th USAAF, was the key to a breakthrough
and when he learned when the last bomb would fall, final orders were issued.
Groups of B-17s began their attack at 1226 hours and the last bomb fell at
1345 hours. Two groups correctly identified their targets and delivered good
concentrations on Bretteville-sur-Laize and St. Sylvain villages that anchored the
German defences. Unfortunately, other groups were badly disorganized by flak
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND

and bombs fell over a wide area including the suburbs of Caen, where Canadian
and Polish troops suffered more than 350 casualties from this friendly fire. This
tragedy had no effect on the forward troops who crossed their startlines shortly
after the bombing ended.
There was now little a corps commander could do to influence the battle
and as reports of halting progress reached his headquarters it was evident that the
heavily defended very narrow gap at Cintheaux was causing serious problems.
Cintheaux was finally secured and the quarry at Hautmesnil reached, but as the
sun set the leading elements of both divisions began to dig in. Simonds, who had
been hoping for a breakthrough, was very unhappy ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

or rear or to exploit a success .
(d) To draw the enemy into prepared traps .
(e) As advance, flank, or rear guards.
(f) On terrain impassable for medium tanks .
(2) The medium tanks are used-

enemy resistance when the antitank defense is strong .
(b) To support by fire the advance of light tanks, other
medium tanks, or infantry in tank versus tank action,
â 4 . INFLUENCE OF TERRAIN In any plan for employment of
tanks, the influence of terrain must be carefully analyzed .
(See FM 17-10 .) Tanks are extremely sensitive to terrain
and, many times, infantry must attack to secure ground
from which the tank attack may be launched . However, do
not dismiss the possibility of the use of difficult terrain . The
surprise gained may be worth the labor of traversing it .

1 10 . CONTROL, Control as discussed herein consists of both
tactical and fire .
a . Tactical .-Control once lost is difficult to regain. It is â¢
therefore imperative that the battalion commander use every
means within his power to insure adequate control of his
battalion at all times. Control is exercised by-
(1) Giving clear definite orders as to formations, zones,
lines of departure, axis of advance, phase lines, attack positions,
objectives, and rallying points. (See s ec. VI .) It is
not sufficient merely to give these orders ; the battalion
commander must allow time for lower commanders to transmit
these orders to all personnel and must assure himself
that this is done. The most brilliantly conceived plan is
likely to fail if it is not properly transmitted to the troops
and if execution of it is not supervised . Plan, order, supervise .

See figure 8 for battalion radio net.
(b) The use of radio must be kept to the minimum . Messages
must be brief . Do not send messages in the clear that
will disclose information upon which the enemy will have
time to act. Commanders habitually use the radio themselves
.
(o) On the march, radio is usually silent although receivers
are turned on and all except a small number used for
other purposes are set on the battalion net. Radios must be
silent at least 1/2 hour before reaching bivouac. They must
be silent in bivouac,
b . Fire .-The control of the fire of a tank battalion
with its supporting weapons and reinforcements is an extremely
difficult task., The battalion commander must rely
to a great extent upon mission-type fire orders as control
of individual weapons is impracticable . In general, the battaliori'commander
controls fire initially by giving targets to
supporting weapons and zones of action for his leading companies
: During action, the battalion commander by means
of radio or by oral order when practicable gives fire missions
to his battalion .
(1) Initial,-(a) Leading companies .-Leading companies
are given a direction of attack or'zone of action . The locations'of
any known hostile targets are designated to the company
commander and the company commander is then left
free to control the fire of'his company .
(b)' Reserve company.-Part 'or all of the reserve company
may be given an initial mission of supporting the leading
companies by *fire .' Known targets 'are pointed out to the
platoon or company commander and a time for opening fire
designated. If location of targets, such; an antitank guns, is
not definitely known, the reserve company or its platoons is
given the mission of firing on targets as they appear . Each

platoon will be given the mission of supporting a particular
leading company, to protect a flank, or to cover a particular

(c) Assault gun platoon.-Initially the assault gun platoon,
except when the zone is extremely wide, remains under the
direct control of the battalion commander . The platoon
leader is directed to fire on designated targets if any suitable
targets are known . Otherwise, he places his guns in position
and is directed to fire on targets as they appear .
(d) Mortar platoon.-Initially fire control of the mortar
platoon is the same as for the assault gun platoon . It may
be given smoke missions . (See FM 17-27.)
(e) Supporting tank company or platoon. -A supporting
tank company or platoon is controlled the same as the battalion
reserve .
(f) Supporting infantry .-Supporting infantry is normally
used as a base of fire for the maneuver of the battalion . As
such it is given a mission and fire control left to the unit
commander. (See FM 17-40 and 17-42.)
(g) Artillery,-The battalion commander through his artillery
forward observer calls for such fires as he deems necessary.
(For fire control and coordination see FM 17-62 .)
(2) During action, (a) Leading companies.-Company
commanders control their companies . The battalion commander
gives orders for movements . Rarely will he give
orders for a company to place its fire on any particular target .
He may order the company commander to assist an adjacent
company- but actual fire control is left to the company
commander.
(b) Reserve company.-As the attack progresses the battalion
commander, by radio or personal contact with the
reserve company commander, orders supporting fires for lead-
Ing companies . In this connection, the platoons of the reserve
company may be placed on the battalion command frequency
so fire orders can be given without undue delay .
When the reserve company acts as a unit for maneuver the
company net is re-formed .
(c) Assault gun platoon .-By radio the battalion commander
orders the assault gun platoon to fire on targets as
desired. The assault gun platoon commander must not wait
for orders to fire on targets of opportunity, (See FM 17-25 .)
14

(d) Mortar platoon.-By radio or signal the battalion commander
directs the mortar platoon leader to fire on targets
as they appear or place smoke as needed . (See FM 17-27.)
(e) Supporting tanks.-These are controlled the same as
the reserve company .
(f) Infantry .-As Infantry is needed to reduce resistance
which tanks cannot reach, the battalion commander orders its
use tactically but does not attempt to control the fire .
(g) Artillery .-Through his artillery forward observer the
battalion commander calls for fires as needed . Should this
observer become a casualty the battalion commander, his
5-2-3, or his company commanders and platoon commanders
of the battalion adjust artillery fire .
(3) Adjustment of fire,For maintaining control and obtaining
faster adjustment of fire the battalion commander
may use his S-2-3 to control a part of the fire support. Thus
this officer may direct the fire of the assault guns or mortars
in accordance with the battalion commander's wishes .
c . Signals .-Signals are covered in FM 17-5 . Because of
the distance involved the battalion commander will rarely use
visual signals .
i 11 . ORDERS.-a. Orders are oral or in written message form
and frequently fragmentary . They must be brief, clear, and
when practicable, given at a point from which as much as
possible of the terrain over which the operation is to take
place, can be seen . Full use should be made of marked maps,
aerial photographs, and overlays .
b, The form for a field order is given in FM 101-5 .

trips to the right and left of the line of march, or to reconnoiter
to the front when the battalion is acting alone, or is
acting as an advance guard for a larger force . In assembly
areas and rallying points it is used for close reconnaissance
missions . Before combat the platoon assists the battalion
commander in reconnaissance of the area of employment .
During combat it follows the reserve company, performs
reconnaissance missions to the flanks, or may be used to
maintain liaison with adjacent units, When the battalion
is in the leading echelon of an attack, the reconnaissance
platoon usually follows the second echelon and rejoins the
battalion at the rallying point .
b. The battalion commander and his staff must make personal
reconnaissance for employment of the battalion . This
includes reconnaissance of both terrain and enemy positions .
â 14. MAINTENANCE .-Employment of company maintenance
sections is covered in FM 17-32 .
a. The battalion has no maintenance personnel except for
its own battalion headquarters and headquarters company
vehicles . During operations a battalion maintenance section
of the regimental maintenance company is attached to, or
supports, the battalion . It moves with the battalion and
reinforces the company maintenance sections . This section
accompanies the battalion to the assembly area and attack
positions where it assists in making final adjustments on
vehicles . During combat it follows the battalion as closely
as practicable, along the battalion axis of maintenance designated
by the battalion commander . It seeks disabled vehicles,
reinforces company maintenance sections, and reports
to the regiment, or to the maintenance battalion personnel
with the combat command, the location of any vehicles which
are disabled beyond the capability of the section to repair .
If time permits, an estimate of the extent of the damage
should be transmitted at the same time . The maintenance
section should rejoin the battalion at the rallying point where
it will assist the company maintenance sections . (See FM
17-50 .)
b. During a penetration when the battalion is the first
echelon of attack, maintenance personnel usually follow the
second echelon of attack .

SECTION IV
MARCHES AND BIVOUAC
â¢
16 . GENERAL .-The subject of marches is covered in detail
in FM 25-10, 17-10, and 17-50 .
a. A successful march is one that places the troops and
equipment at their destination at the proper time and in
proper condition to fight . A successful march depends upon
good march discipline . This can be obtained only by thorough
training in march procedure and rigid enforcement of
march rules .
b. The rate of march of a column containing medium tanks
does not exceed 17 miles per hour . This rate may be increased
for short periods for columns which do not contain
medium tanks . However, it must be borne in mind that an
increase of rate of march above 17 miles per hour for extended
periods will cause an exorbitant increase in maintenance
needs .
c . For detailed discussion of distances between vehicles see
FM 25-10 . Ordinarily distances will be not less than 50 yards
and usually will be approximately 90 yards . At times they
may be as great as 0 .1 mile. Movement by infiltration is
discussed in FM 25-10 and 17-50 .
â¢ 17. MARCH PLANS AND ORDERS-The march order for a battalion
is oral, supplemented by sketches or marked maps of
the route. Each vehicle commander and each driver should
know the route and when practicable be given a sketch of the
route . For form for a march order see FM 101-5 .
a . Warning orders.-Warning orders should be issued far
enough in advance of the time set for departure so that proper
preparations for the march may be made . These preparations
will depend upon the situation as to supply and state of
maintenance . A well-trained battalion should be able to

individual arms, machine guns, and 37-mm tank guns . The
75-mm gun may be used at times . For low-flying attack the
guns must be trained on the point of probable appearance of
the airplanes . There will be no time to shift after the airplanes
appear . Have all receivers on battalion frequency so
air alert warning can be transmitted quickly .
(4) At temporary halts, move under concealment and
brush out tracks . If concealment from observation is not
available, move off road and disperse, if possible . Dig slit
trenches at long halts . If vehicles are concealed, do not fire
at airplanes unless attacked .
b . In bivouac.-(1) Air security in bivouac, assembly areas,
and rallying points is obtained primarily by concealment and
dispersion . Air sentries are detailed. Use standard air
alarms. Keep one battalion radio receiver on reconnaissance
unit frequency so early warning of approach of airplanes may
be obtained .
(2) Brush out all tracks (see fig . 40) .
(3) Enforce rigid camouflage discipline . Dig slit trenches .
Prohibit unshielded lights .
(4) Do not fire at airplanes unless attacked.

battalion may be in any of these echelons . Each echelon
attacks in a series of waves using fire and maneuver .
(1) First echelon-The mission of the first echelon of
attack is to destroy enemy antitank defenses, artillery, command
posts, and other rear installations . It pays little
attention to personnel other than that operating antitank
weapons and artillery, command post personnel, or reserves
in assembly areas .
(2) Second echelon-The mission of the second echelon
of attack is to destroy infantry with its weapons, especially
machine guns . It destroys antitank guns passed over by the
leading echelon and also command posts, communication
centers, reserves, and rear installations .
(3) Third echelon.-The third echelon of attack advances
with the infantry and destroys enemy personnel, machine
guns, and installations holding up the infantry .
b. It must not be assumed that the tanks will always attack
first . Many times infantry will attack to secure ground from
which a tank attack may be launched or in conjunction with
engineers, to remove or clear paths through obstacles .
If 29. FORMATIONS, FRONTAGES, AND DEPTHS . -Formations,
frontages, and depths will depend upon the mission, terrain,
enemy situation, and supporting fires . For type formations
see figure 46 . Companies may be in any suitable formation .
(See FM 17-32 .)
a. Frontage.-(1) Wide frontage may be taken on a covering
mission while a penetration calls for narrow frontage and
great depth to give sustaining power to carry the action
through to a successful conclusion .
(2) A narrow frontage to facilitate control is taken in
wooded terrain . Impassable ground may narrow the formation,
(See fig . 47 .) In open terrain, wider frontages than
for wooded terrain are practicable and desirable .
(3) When enemy has few antitank guns and his other antitank
defensives are light a wide frontage may be taken . If
enemy antitank defenses are strong and cannot be avoided, a
narrow frontage and formation in great depth is taken .
(4) When well supported by artillery and bombardment
aviation, the frontage may be greater than when such support
is light or lacking . In the latter cases, the tanks must
furnish their own supporting fires .

(3) The reserve is usually located behind the company
making the main effort . It moves from firing position to
firing position to give continuous support to the leading companies,
It is prepared to repel counterattacks from the flank
or to pass through a depleted leading company and continue
the attack.
(4) Unless an extremely wide front is covered, the mortar
platoon and the assault gun platoon should be retained under
battalion control .
c . Wedge,-This formation is used in advancing against an
enemy whose defenses have not been definitely located. The
leading company covers the advance of the other two companies
. These companies In turn protect the flanks, give fire
support to the leading company, and are prepared to maneuver
to either flank. Mortars and assault guns may be attached
to the leading company.
d. Column.-Column gives maximum control and driving
power . The battalion may be quickly developed to either
flank . The formation is useful in passing through woods .
It may have to be used in passing a defile . It is the best
formation for a penetration when the battalion is acting
alone . For the initial advance against light enemy resistance,
the leading company will usually cover a broad front,
e . Echelon.-The battalion may be echeloned either to the
right or left . Such formations are useful for a flank battalion
as it gives great flank protection by favoring rapid deployment
to the exposed flank . Assault guns and mortars may
be attached to companies .
f. Line.-This is a rare formation as it provides little depth
and consequently low sustaining power . Its use is confined
to screening or counterreconnaissance missions . Assault guns
and mortars should be attached to companies .

0 30. BATTALION HEADQUARTERS (see FM 17-10) .-a. In the approach
to combat and in combat, the battalion has with it only
those individuals and veh :cles necessary for the control, maintenance,
and evacuation of the battalion and for supply of the
battalion in the assembly position . All supply vehicles-gasoline,
ammunition, equipment, and kitchen trucks if with the
column-are left at the assembly position to be moved forward
as directed by the regimental or combat command commander.
Personnel sections are with the regimental, combat
command, or division trains .
b. The forward echelon of battalion headquarters (see FM
17-10) moves with the battalion to the attack position. During
combat the battalion commander, the S-2-3, and the artillery
forward observer move forward with the battalion, the
headquarters commandant remains at the attack position
with the battalion headquarters maintenance section, attached
battalion maintenance section, battalion medical detachment,
and such other vehicles and personnel as the battalion
commander may direct . The actions of maintenance
and medical personnel are covered in section III . The headquarters
commandant moves this group forward as directed
by the battalion commander . In a penetration this group
will follow the second or third echelon of attack .
0 31. SUPPORTING FIRES.-a. Artillery (see FM 17-60) .-The
artillery gives close support to the attack in all stages . (See
FM 17-10.) An artillery forward observer, mounted in a tank,
advances behind the leading waves of tanks . This officer has
direct radio communication with the supporting artillery battalion
and the tank battalion commander. Other artillery
officers usually will be forward to conduct fire of individual
battefles as may be necessary, but these will not be in the radio
net of the tank battalion commander.
(1) The tank battalion commander may expect from the
artillery-
71

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(a) Firing of concentrations to cover development for an
attack.
(b) Assistance in security of assembly area by placing concentrations
on avenues of approach for hostile troops,
(c) Assistance in protection of the rallying point by fires as
necessary on threatening hostile elements, and by counterbattery
fire .
(d) Support of initial attack by fires on hostile front line
installations, antitank guns, observation posts, and artillery.
Targets must not be closer than 300 yards to friendly troops .
An area 200 yards wide and 200 yards deep can be effectively
covered by one battery .
(e) Continuing support as attack progresses by concentrations
on hostile troops and weapons holding up the attack .
(J) Screening, by smoke, of hostile antitank guns and
observation points .
(g) Assistance in breaking up hostile counterattacks, including
hostile armored threats from the flanks .
(h) Destruction of road blocks and troops defending them .
(2) The battalion commander should not expect the
artillery to-
(a) Fire a long preparation before the attack, unless special
arrangements have been made for dumping additional ammunition
at the guns .
(b) Fire concentrations on unimportant targets or targets
which the tanks themselves may overcome without excessive
danger .
(c) Fire at targets that can be neutralized more quickly by
assault guns, mortars, or tank weapons . Small targets close
to the leading tanks and positively located can usually be
eliminated quickly without calling for an artillery concentration
.
(d) Blast extensive passageways through mine fields .
(3) Each officer must know how to call for and adjust artillery
fire. (See FM 17-62.) Radio nets should be set up so
that each tank company commander, if necessary, can tune
into the artillery net . The company commander needing
artillery support first calls his battalion commander on the
radio, gives location and type of target, and requests fire .
The battalion commander turns the fire mission over to the

SECTION V
PURSUIT
578 The pursuit is launched when the enemy is no longer
able to maintain his position and endeavors to escape by
retreat A commander recognizes success by the continued
advance of his troops in a decisive direction and the capture
of critical objectives ; by the number and morale of captured
prisoners ; by the number of abandoned weapons ; by the
numbers of hostile dead; by the diminution of hostile artillery
fire ; by the relaxation or cessation of hostile countermeasures
; and from reports that the enemy is withdrawing
579 When a commander recognizes that the enemy is
having difficulty in maintaining his position he utilizes all
means to maintain the continuity of the attack and exert a
relentless pressure on the defeated enemy
Effective pursuit requires leadership and exercise of initiative
to the highest degree in all echelons of command All
commanders in the attack echelon spur on their troops and
clinch the advantage with their reserves Pursuit of a defeated
enemy is pushed to the utmost limit of endurance of
troops animals and vehicles No opportunity is given him
to reorganize his forces and reconstitute his defense
3
580-584
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
0 580 The object of the pursuit is the annihilation of the
hostile forces This can seldom be accomplished by a straight
pushing back of the hostile forces on their lines of communication
Direct pressure against the retreating forces must be
combined with an enveloping or encircling maneuver to place
troops across the enemy's lines of retreat Encirclement of
both flanks of the retreating forces or of their separate elements
is attempted wherever conditions permit
By the coordinated employment of every available agency
of destruction and terrorization the shaken morale of the
defeated enemy is converted into panic The incipient dissolution
of his organization is transformed into rout
0 58 In anticipation of the time for launching the pursuit
the commander causes preparatory measures to be taken
These measures include necessary plans and orders in all
echelons Reserves are regrouped Artillery and other necessary
units are attached to the direct pressure forces for
the pursuit Distant objectives are assigned to the principal
tactical groupings Missions are assigned to combat aviation
and to the artillery in general support to obstruct movement
on hostile avenues of withdrawal Preparations are made
for launching one or more forces of great mobility in encircling
maneuvers to strike the enemy in flank and rear and
cut off his retreat General reserves are especially appropriate
for this mission (See par 507 )
â¢ 582 The pursuit is conducted on a broad front Motor
transportation is employed to expedite the movement of foot
troops
Troops before whom the enemy is giving way send in their
reserves to gain his flank and rear or break through his covering
troops
â¢ 583 The forces engaged in the direct pressure and in the
encircling maneuvers are assigned directions zones of action
and objectives designed to bring the pursuit to a decisive conclusion
Such directions and zones of action may be around
the flanks or through the wider gaps which defeat has opened
in the hostile dispositions or may be a continuation of the
existing zones of action
â¢ 584 Supporting combat aviation concentrates on lines of
communication centers in the enemy's rear area on hostile
columns in retreat and on hostile reserves endeavoring to
32
OPERATIONS
584-587
reconstitute the defense It blocks defiles on the enemy's
line of retreat and disrupts traffic on the main roads and
railroads in the enemy's rear area
Observation aviation reconnoiters the roads in the enemy's
zone of retreat to keep contact with retreating columns
and to locate any movement of hostile reinforcements and
keeps ground commanders informed of the hostile activities
and movement within their zones of action
0 585 The employment of artillery is based upon the maximum
exploitation of the mobility of lighter pieces and the long
range of the heavier types So long as the withdrawing enemy
can be engaged with observed and planned fire a portion of
the artillery remains in position to fire on the more distant
targets Long-range artillery working with observation aviation
and balloons continues its fire on the enemy lines of
communication up to the limit of its range
The artillery attached to the pursuing forces in addition
to its supporting action fires on hostile elements attempting
to form columns in rear of the enemy's covering troops and
gradually takes over the missions of the artillery remaining
in position
0 586 The purpose of the encircling maneuver is to get in
rear of the defeated enemy and halt his retreat so that he
may be destroyed between the direct pressure and encircling
forces
When practicable mobile forces in the encircling maneuvers
advance along roads paralleling the enemy's line of retreat
to cut him off at defiles bridges and other critical points
When the encircling forces cannot outdistance the enemy
they push through to a critical locality and engage the enemy's
main forces in flank
Combat aviation ; armored mechanized and motorized
units ; and cavalry are employed in the encircling maneuvers
Troops transported by air for employment at critical defiles
deep in the hostile rear pending the arrival of more powerful
mobile encircling forces may contribute decisively to a successful
pursuit
587 The advance in the decisive direction must be maintained
Hostile rear guards or forces on flank positions must
not turn pursuing forces from the decisive direction Every
effort must be made to block the main hostile force When
33
587-590
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
necessary a new encircling force to continue the pursuit is
constituted
When the enemy succeeds in establishing himself in a position
from which he cannot be dislodged quickly the superior
commander takes prompt measures to coordinate the attack
again supporting it with all available means (See pars
557 and 558 )
0 588 The enemy's attempts to organize his retreat under
the cover of darkness must be frustrated Under no circumstances
must he be allowed to break contact Units which
have advanced without serious opposition continue their
march during the night Other units organize successive
limited attacks against the enemy in their front
During a night pursuit the leading detachments push their
advance along all available roads followed by the main pursuing
forces ' The attached artillery advances by echelon
going into successive positions from which it can interdict
the enemy's routes of retreat by map firing or by fire directed
by observers which accompany the leading detachments
Prompt report is made when objectives are reached so that
artillery fires may be coordinated
The effect of artillery fire is complemented by combat aviation
which searches enemy routes of retreat with flares and
bombs enemy columns and critical points in the enemy's rear
area
â¢ 589 Pursuit requires extensive reliance upon radio for
communication with the leading troops The importance
attached to hostile interception of radio communication in
other situations does not obtain in equal degree in pursuit
Effort is made to intercept the enemy's radio messages The
construction of wire lines is concentrated along the more important
axes Command posts or advance message centers
are established close behind the leading troops
â¢ 590 Adequate provision for the supply of ammunition and
motor fuel to the pursuing troops is essential to the success
of the pursuit The commander must relieve the pursuing
columns of all worries concerning supply and evacuation

SECTION VI
SECURITY IN THE Or r aNSIVE
â¢ 59 Success or failure of an offensive is dependent in a
large measure upon the action taken to protect the command
from hostile reaction Open flanks are highly vulnerable
The best security is to keep the enemy so heavily
involved that he has no time or means available to endanger
the success of the attack Security of attack forces is assured
by a timely search for information in all directions from
which a hostile threat may come by the proper disposition
of security forces of ample mobility and combat power and
by prompt dispatch of accurate information and orders to
security forces This is particularly true in security against
hostile forces of great mobility such as air tank motorized
and cavalry units In offensive operations the service of
security is performed in accordance with the general doctrines
discussed in chapter 6
â¢ 59Z In offensive operations the mass of available means
for defense against air and mechanized attack is disposed
to favor the main attack The combat means for defense
against air attack are supplemented by utilization of cover
defilade dispersion and night movements to the maximum
The combat means for defense against attack by tanks or
other mechanized forces are supplemented by utilization of
natural and artificial obstacles to protect the flanks and rear
of the command by dispersion and by night movements
(See chs 6 and 0 )
â¢ 593 Antitank guns in each echelon of troops are disposed
to cover the most likely avenues of approach of hostile
mechanized units ; the bulk of the antitank guns are held
mobile prepared to meet a hostile mechanized attack at any
point Protection against mechanized attack is best assured
by meeting the attack with the combined action of tanks
and mobile antitank guns supported by every available and
effective means of fire support to isolate and destroy the
hostile mechanized forces
â¢ 594 In offensive operations the greatest need for security
exists during critical phases of the battle Security is enhanced
by meeting possible threats with heavy fire before
they can develop The action of combat aviation against
45
594-596
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
highly mobile threats and against close less mobile threats
is particularly effective especially if hostile troops or vehicles
are in close formation
SECTION VII
TERMINATION OF OFFENSIVE ACTION
â¢ 595 An offensive action once begun is halted only by hostile
reaction or by other elements in the situation which
demand it
If during the course of an attack it becomes necessary
to pass to the defensive the leading foot elements intrench
themselves on the ground then held The leading echelon
then is thinned out and forces are redistributed to organize
the defense in depth It may be necessary to move some elements
to the front or rear for short distances to establish
the defense on favorable terrain and secure flanking fire
Any major adjustments attempted in daylight will probably
result in heavy casualties The general position of attacking
units is maintained until darkness when the selected
defensive position is occupied and organized as described in
chapter 0
If the situation demands major adjustments in daylight
they are accomplished under protection of fog or smoke and
of a maximum of fire support by artillery combat aviation
and other supporting weapons
â¢ 596 If during the course of an attack it becomes necessary
to break off the action and withdraw the command
initially passes to the defensive The completeness of the
defense is dependent upon the situation and whether the
initial defensive and the withdrawal must be executed in
daylight or darkness Thereafter the withdrawal is executed
according to the doctrines discussed in chanter
36
CHAPTER 0
THE DEFENSIVE
SECTION I
ORGANIZATION FOR DEFENSE
GENERAL
0 597 The general object of defensive combat is to gain time
pending the development of more favorable conditions for
undertaking the offensive or to economize forces on one front
for the purpose of concentrating superior forces for a decision
elgewhere
Under the first of these objects a commander may assume
the defensive pending the arrival of reinforcements or he
may be thrown on the defensive by inferiority in numbers
disposition or training He may take up a defensive position
and invite attack as part of a deliberate plan to win the battle
by a counteroffensive
Under the second object the defensive is usually expressed
in the mission received from higher authority This mission
may be to hold a vital area pending completion of the maneuver
of other forces to protect a flank or to contain an
enemy force while an offensive is being conducted on another
part of the front or in another theater
â¢ 598 Our defensive doctrine contemplates the organization
of a battle position to be held at all costs and the use of
covering forces to delay and disorganize the advance of the
enemy and to deceive him as to the true location of the battle
position (See par 6 0 )
RECONNAISSANCE AND SELECTION OF POSITION
â¢
599 The mission 'the situation and the terrain limit the
choice of localities where the defense may be offered
Commanders of large units usually determine the general
location of the battle position from the map
The position on which battle is offered must conform to the
object of the defense and should facilitate future maneuver
without jeopardizing the success of the defense It must
37
599-603
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
force the enemy to a direct attack or a time-consuming
maneuver as a position that can be readily avoided has no
defensive value A flank position must draw the enemy from
his original direction of advance
â¢ 600 Reconnaissance of the position is as detailed as the
situation permits It includes a study of the principal routes
of hostile approach terrain available for hostile observation
and the corridors most advantageous to the hostile attack A
Study of the terrain in which the enemy must carry out his
attack will give valuable indications of his possible assembly
positions the location of his artillery the terrain favorable
for attack by his mechanized forces and the area most
advantageous for his main attack
â¢ 60 If contact with the enemy has not been made the commander
ordinarily is free to make a detailed reconnaissance
o position select the terrain on which to defend and decide
on the best distribution of troops In this case the command
usually is developed into an assembly position preliminary to
deployment for defense
â¢ 602 Basing his action on his mission his personal reconnaissance
the reconnaissance reports of his subordinates and
the available information of the enemy and friendly troops
the commander forms an estimate of the enemy's capabilities
and the probable front of hostile attack and makes his decision
regarding the location of the main line of resistance
and the regimental reserve line the employment of the
artillery the assignment of sectors the strength and location
of the general reserve the antimechanized defenses and other
measures necessary for security Successive reconnaissances
by lower commanders fix on the ground the distribution of
smaller units and the location of their combat emplacements
Exact information as to the trace of the main line of resistance
is furnished to the artillery
0 603 In the hasty assumption of the defensive from a
march formation reconnaissance usually must be curtailed
and the defense assumed directly from the development
Depending on the mission and the situation it may be
advisable for a commander initially to attack to seize terrain
to his front on which to organize the battle position In
other situations he may employ a covering force organizing
the battle position on terrain in rear
38 3 6266Â°--4 -- n
39
OPERATIONS
604-606
â¢ 604 Continuous reconnaissance and observation of the
enemy's dispositions are conducted to secure the earliest possible
indications of the enemy's offensive preparations Air
reconnaissance provides the information concerning the situation
in rear of the enemy's leading elements
â¢ 605 The character of the terrain exercises a decisive influence
on the selection of position Ridges and valleys generally
parallel to the front of advance constitute obstacles to
the progress of an offensive and are natural lines of resistance
for the defense Such ridges often afford observation and
fields of fire favorable for a defense in depth
Natural obstacles (e g river lines woods swamps) are
important factors for consideration especially if the situation
requires that protective measures be taken against mechanized
units or other mobile forces such as horse cavalry or
motorized units
Commanding elevations and ridges delimit the compartments
of terrain and form the framework of the system of
observation command and fire control in combat They
determine directly the location of the observation posts and
positions of the artillery and other supporting weapons and
indirectly the location of defensive and assembly positions
As a general rule long gentle slopes afford better conditions
for defense than abrupt elevations However positions along
commanding heights are suited for delaying action
0 606 The battle position is so selected as to use the terrain
to the greatest advantage The extent of the position must
be appropriate to the available troops
The most important terrain factors are-adequate artillery
observation good fields of fire concealment from hostile observation
and the presence of natural obstacles The relative
importance of these terrain factors depends upon the
strength composition armament and mission of the defending
force together with aa consideration of the enemy's
capabilities
In selecting the forward limit of the battle position the
defender seeks terrain which will permit the most effective
employment of the fires of artillery and other weapons Clear
fields of fire for small arms are important and usually lead
to its location on a forward slope Consideration of concealment
may however make it desirable to select a reverse slope
606-608
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
Such a location is practicable when possession of the crest to
the front is not essential to the observation of artillery fire
When the forward limit of the position is on the forward
slope the defense areas of front-line battalions may be extended
to the rear to include the reverse slope When it is
located on the reverse slope front-line battalions establish
strong detachments from their reserves on the forward crest
to fire on attacking troops during their approach to the
position
Observation to the limit of range of the weapons is desired
in front of the main line of resistance as welt as within the
battle position Adequate observation posts for artillery are
essential The battle position must be so located that the
essential observation will be retained even though the enemy
succeeds in penetrating into the position
Maximum advantage is taken of natural and artificial
obstacles to stop attack by mechanized units or limit the
directions of their movement Towns villages and cities
have considerable defensive strength against mechanized
attack They are however vulnerable to air attack especially
by incendiary bombs
Â® 607 All parts of a position will not have the same defensive
strength Avenues of approach which enable the attacker
to reach the position under concealment or cover are sources
of weakness These avenues of approach may however be
unsuited for enemy tank attacks Clear fields of fire over
which the enemy must advance for some distance under the
defender's fire are sources of strength in a defense against
foot troops but may furnish excellent terrain for hostile
mechanized attack The defender must be prepared to meet
that form of attack which the terrain favors
608 A position combining all defensive advantages will
seldom be available The weak points of a position are
strengthened A short field of frontal fire is compensated by
dense flanking fires and heavy mortar and artillery concentrations
; exposure to hostile observation by distribution in
depth and construction of dummy works and masks; deficient
observation by increased strength of local garrisons Persistent
chemicals demolitions and mines can be used effectively
to strengthen exposed flanks and to contaminate and
block covered avenues of approach leading Into the position

surprise The visible lines of a defensive system must not
betray the defensive dispositions They should mask the real
defensive organization Every available means must be employed
not only to mislead the attacker as to the location
of the position but also as to the strength and disposition of
the defending force Deception delay and security are obtained
through the use of covering detachments
TACTICAL ORGANIZATION
â 6 0 The defense is built around a series a tactical localities
the retention of which will insure the integrity of the
position A battle position comprises a zone of resistance
consisting of a number of mutually supporting defense areas
disposed irregularly in width and in depth each organized for
all around defense with trenches obstacles and emplacements
Tactical unity is maintained in each defensive area
A line joining the forward edge of the most advanced
organized defense areas is called the main line of resistance
It is the line in front of which all elements of the defense
must be able to concentrate their fire to break up the hostile
attack The contour of the main line of resistance is thus
irregular in trace with elements on it sited for frontal and
flanking fire A line designated to coordinate the locations
and actions of the regimental reserves in the battle position
is called the regimental reserve line
â 6 Between the main line of resistance and the regimental
reserve line company supports and battalion reserves
organize the ground The distance between successive echelons
on the battle position (units on the main line of resistance
company supports battalion reserves and regimental
reserves) should not exceed the effective range of small-arms
fire It should however be sufficiently great to prevent any
echelon from falling Into the zone of dispersion of artillery
fire directed against a more advanced echelon This distribution
in depth diminishes the effect of hostile fire and provides
for continuity in' defensive fires -and movement against the
enemy even though he succeeds in penetrating into the battle
position

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â¢ 6 2 The natural defensive strength of the position has a
direct bearing upon the distribution of troops for its defense
both as to frontage and depth Portions of the front which
have great defensive strength can be held with fewer men
or units can be assigned wider sectors while the reverse is
true in weak portions of the front There is thus a variation
in the troops which can be made available for reserves Close
terrain and exhausted troops require a greater density of
troops forward toward the main line of resistance
â¢ 6 3 The width of sectors assigned to infantry units varies
with the natural defensive strength of the various parts of
the position the relative importance of the sectors the degree
of control required and the number and strength of units
available The necessity for control and the character of
fields of fire affect the intervals which may be permitted between
tactical localities Some variation in the width of sectors
may arise from the necessity for adjusting them to fix
responsibility for defense of terrain corridors By adaptation
of the width of sectors to their natural strength there results
an economy of force which enables the commander to hold out
the maximum strength for use as reserves
â¢ 6 4 Sectors are delimited in orders by boundaries-lines
indicated on the map or ground extending from rear to front
Boundaries are located so that there will be no question of
the responsibility for the defense of the key terrain which
dominates a critical avenue of hostile approach While it is
frequently impossible to include both the avenue of hostile
approach and the adjacent dominating terrain in the sector
of the small units the boundaries of sectors assigned to battalion
and larger units should be located to insure unity of
defensive dispositions and fires in defense of these critical
localities
Boundaries are extended forward of the battle position to
the limit of the range of the weapons with which the unit
is equipped Boundaries may be extended forward to include
the outpost line in order to delineate the outpost responsibility
of units on the battle position The extension' of boundaries
to the rear is influenced largely by the existing road net
and routes for movement within the position

6 5 The division commander determines the distribution
of the division artillery and its subdivision for combat (direct

and general support) Since the rapid concentration of artillery
fire on important objectives is essential to a successful
defense when the situation permits control of the artillery
under the direction of the division commander is preferable
Every effort is made to meet the hostile main attack with the
mass of the artillery fire
The echelonment in depth of the artillery takes into consideration
the range of the various weapons the location of
the targets and the possibilities of neutralization by hostile
counterbattery fire The echelonment is limited by the considerations
that the entire artillery must be able to concentrate
its fire in close support of the main line of resistance
that the foremost echelon can fire deep in the hostile zone
and that the rearmost can support the rear defense areas of
the battle position
â¢ 6 6 The battle position is protected by outposts whose
mission is to provide time for the main force to prepare itself
for combat to deceive the enemy as to the location of the
battle position to force early development by the enemy
and to provide a deeper view within the terrain over which
the attacker will advance
Whenever practicable the outposts are located at sufficient
distance from the main line of resistance to prevent the occupying
forces from being taken under observed fire by hostile
light artillery Outposts will ordinarily not be established beyond
the effective range of the light artillery of the battle
position
The outpost line of resistance and the ground between the
outpost and the battle position are organized for delaying
action to the extent permitted by the time and labor available
â¢ 6 7 When forced to withdraw under hostile pressure the
outposts conduct a delaying action Every effort is made
to deceive the enemy as to the exact location of the battle
position The withdrawal of the outposts must be so arranged
that they neither will interfere with nor be endangered
by the fire from the main position Coordination is
facilitated by the use of prearranged signals and previously
designated routes of withdrawal
â¢ 6 8 Whenever practicable an advanced covering force is
employed in front of the outpost The mission of this covering
force is to inflict the maximum delay on the enemy to
43

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
permit the defender to utilize advanced artillery observation
to permit the laying of mines demolitions and obstacles in
front of the outpost and the battle position and to deceive
the enemy as to the actual location of the battle position
Similarly such forces may be employed on exposed flanks
6 9 Natural terrain obstacles such as water courses heavily
wooded areas and swamps are particularly favorable
areas for the operations of advanced covering forces
The initial position of the advanced covering force and
the terrain between this force and the outpost are organized
to the extent practicable in the time available
620 The advanced covering force should be mobile The
use of cavalry mechanized and motorized troops and engineers
is indicated It should have strong artillery and antitank
support Organic artillery may be reinforced by artillery
from the main force temporarily emplaced in advance of
the battle position
â 62 The advanced covering force fights delaying action in
its withdrawal It avoids serious engagement with the enemy
622 The direction from which the main attack may be expected
and the commander's plan of maneuver determine the
initial location of the reserve According to circumstances
it is echeloned for protective purposes in rear of an exposed
flank held in a position in readiness from which it can deliver
a prepared counterattack or so disposed that it can
launch the counteroffensive by striking a hostile attack in
flank
623 Large horse cavalry units should rarely be called on to
defend a position Cavalry seeks to accomplish defensive missions
by delaying action or by defensive-offensive tactics
When required to defend in position it operates in general
as does infantry
624 Corps and division cavalry is employed on reconnaissance
missions with especial attention to locating the mass of
the hostile force It may be reinforced by motorized 'infantry
artillery and engineers and employed as a mobile covering
detachment (See par 598 ) During battle it continues
reconnaissance and security missions especially to the flanks
It may he held in mobile reserve or used to harass enemy
flanks and rear when the situation permits

interference persistent chemical mines are employed , when the area is controlled by theenemy aviation artillery or chemical mortars are used Indeciding to use persistent chemicals the commander mustcarefully evaluate its effect on his contemplated future operations 64The selection of a rear position at such distance fromthe' main position that the attacker cannot direct the fireof his artillery upon it without displacing his batteries facilitates the conduct of a flexible defense The extent of its organization will depend upon the situation and the time available The forces employed in the construction of the rearposition must not be obtained at the risk of jeopardizing thedefense of the main battle position 642 The development of a hastily occupied defensive position into a more strongly fortified defensive system is dependent upon the situation and the time and material available for construction This may take place on a front whichhas stabilized after an indecisive battle or is out of contactwith the enemy 643The development of such a defensive position aimsfirst of all to strengthen the main line of resistance batterypositions and the command and

areas of resistance in rearof the main line of resistance permanent works are constructed to limit hostile penetration All works are concealedor camouflagedIn the siting of emplacements for defending

forms of protectionhaving permanent value against fire are dugouts and concrete or steel shelters sufficiently resistant to withstand highpowered artillery fire and bombs from the air Deep dugoutsin the front lines do not permit the prompt egress of troopsand in case of attack may become traps Overhead cover forfront-line troops is designed chiefly to afford splinter-proofprotection and shelter

by a local attack are firedon the order of subordinate commanders 655 If the enemy succeeds in launching his attack in spiteof the counterpreparation the artillery seeks to keep himunder fire in considerable depth by placing defensive concentrations on his advancing attack echelons and on his reservesand by continuing counterbattery fire These fires are delivered on the request of supported unit commanders orof observers following the progress of the attack with airor ground observation 656 Finally defensive concentrations and barrages arefired close to our troops They strengthen the fire of otherweapons covering the most dangerous avenues of approachto the positionsBarrages generally are delivered on pyrotechnic signal from the front-line troops but may be executed on report from

lack of firepower, although at close ranges . this weapon is capable
of knocking out the heavyy tank of the Germz .ns . The U. S. 37mm gun
was at least as pov~erfll as tie Germ and Jupcne"" counterparts in
the field tit hat time .
The + incorporates all the battle experience gained earlier
in the .x~ r, including such features as gyro stabilizers and Hydramatic
tri,nsri ssion. It yes ALU advantage of sloping armor coeensurate
with the weight limitations svecified by the using services .
It has seen considerable service in Europe, and reports on its battlefield
performance contain nothing but praise .
MEDIUM TANKS
Pz. Kpfw. III Aus. A. B, C. D, E (Sd. Kfz . 141)
Reports on the early development of the Pz . Kw. III do not
agree. The following summary conforms to the best information
available.
Model A-Weighed about 20 tons. Its suspension arrangemerit
consisted of eight small bogie wheels each side on semielliptical,
laminated springs, with three return rollers . Motivating
power was generated by a Maybach V-12 gasoline engine rated
300 hp . Armament consisted of a 3 .7 cm Kw. K ., two light machine
guns in the turret, and one light machine gun in the front plate of
the superstructure . Armor consisted of 30 mm plate all around .
Model B-Same as Model A except for suspension which consisted
of five medium size bogie wheels and two return rollers .
Model C-Principal change was the new type suspension
which incorporated six bogie wheels and three return rollers,
which became standard for the Pz. Kw. III tank . It is believed that
torsion bar suspension evolved in this model.
Model D'-At this point in the development the previous
models were given the nomenclature D' . Commander's tanks are
known to have been produced serially from this period on .
Model E-Represents the first model in which the definite Pz .
Kw. III type has been crystallized . It embodies the improvements
made in previous models. It carried the same armament (3 .7 cm
Kw. K.) and had a suspension arrangement of six bogie wheels
sprung on torsion bars and three return rollers.
A self-propelled equipment known as the Sturmgeschutz has
been developed from the Pz. Kw. III . It consists of the Pz . Kw. III
chassis mounting a short-barreled 7 .5 cm Kw. K. The chassis was
later used to mount the 7.5 cm Kw . K. 40, long-barreled gun, and
the 10 .5 cm howitzer.

Model F-This is the first tank of the series to mount a 5 .0 cm
Kw. K. electrically fired tank gun in place of the 3.7 cm Kw. K. and
also the first to have a new type mantlet. This mantlet has a thick
shield on the front which moves with the gun. A single machine
gun is mounted coaxially on the right of the 5 .0 cm gun and the
hull machine gun is retained.
The hull consists of three separate subassemblies : (1) lower
hull, (2) front superstructure carrying turret, and (3) rear superstructure
covering the engine compartment. All units are of single
skin welded construction.
The turret forms the roof of a spacious fighting compartment,
being mounted over the middle part of the hull. It has no rotating
platform, the commander and the gunner having seats suspended
from and rotating with the turret . The loader apparently stands on
the floor of the fighting compartment . The commander's cupola is
boltea to the roof of the turret on the center-line to the rear .
The suspension is the same as that used in Model E .
The engine is the Maybach V-12, gasoline, rated 320 hp. Its
transmission is the synchromesh type with 10 speeds forward and
4 reverse. Its steering is of the epicyclic, clutch brake type with
hydraulic control.
Model G-Identical in armament, mantlet, and mechanical
components to Model F, the only difference being in the cupola,
which is more squat and has all-around vision .
Model H-This model has additional 32 mm plates bolted on
the front of the superstructure, on the upper and lower nose plates
and on the tail plate. The outstandinq recognition features of this
model are its front sprocket which has six spokes, and its rear
idler which is more open than the earlier type, though it has eight
spokes. Wider tracks and narrower bogie wheels are also used .

Pz. Kpfw. III Aus .J, K (Sd. Kfz. 141)
Model J-The principal differences between Model J and
earlier models are
1. Increased thickness of basic armor plate on certain front
and rear plates from 30 mm to 50 mm and the addition of spaced
armor on the front of the gun mantlet and the front plate of the
superstructure .
2. Hydraulically operated steering in the earlier models has
been replaced by mechanical steering. As previously reported,
the complicated Maybach Variorex ten-speed gear was abandoned
in Model H in favor of a manual six-speed and reverse gear box.
3 . Wider tracks-15 inches instead of 14'/a inches . The
heavier track necessitated a change in the spacing of the return
rollers. Front and rear rollers are now mounted directly over the
Luvax shock absorbers and prevent the track fouling the latter .
4. The tail plate has been modified to give better protection
to the rear air outlet : it also allows the smoke device to be mounted
inside the plate.
5. One or two mild steel bars, welded at each end, are fixed
across the middle of the nose plate . The track shoes are placed
behind the bars and are held in position by the bridge of the shoe .
6. The mounting of the 5.0 cm Kw. K. 39 (long gun) was incorporated
in the latest of the Model J tanks .
The most prominent recognition points of this model are : the
mounting of the hull machine gun is of prominent ball type ; the
driver's visor consists of a single hinged piece of armor instead of
two separate plates ; the front sprocket and rear idler are similar to
those in Model H; particularly squat turret, pear-shaped with
circular cupola well set to the rear .
Model K-Same as Model J. This model mounted the 5 .0 cm
long gun (Kw. K. 39).

Model L-In this model the loader's visor in the right of the
gun mantlet has been omitted as well as the vision opeiiings on
each side of the turret in front of the access doors . Spaced armor
is always fitted on the front of the superstructure and fittings for
spaced armor are provided on the gun mantlet, but the curved
spaced plate is not always fitted in the latter position . The long
5.0 cm Kw.K. 39 is balanced by a torsion bar . The torsion bar
compensator is mounted on the roof of the turret and connected to
the gun by means of a link . On the cupola of this model a metal
framework is attached, probably to serve as a rest for the gun . In
other respects Model L is identical to Model I . German markings
on this tank indicate that it was prepared for tropical or desert use .
Preparation consisted of slight changes in the air-cooling system
and addition of deflectors on the rear of the tank to prevent the
exhaust gases and cooling air from striking the ground .
Model M-This model is similar to Model L with the exception
that it has no loading doors fitted on the side of the hull.
Models N, O-Reports indicate the existence of these models
but no details are available .
A few Model L tanks and many Model M and N tanks now
mount the 7.5 cm Kw.K., which is the short gun formerly fitted in
the Pz . Kpfw. IV. Recent models of the Pz. Kpfw. III now in service
mount, therefore, either the 5 cm long gun or the 7.5 cm short gun .
When the latter gun is mounted, the spaced armor plate on the gun
mantlet and the fittings for it are omitted altogether . The mantlet
is one of the Pz. Kpfw. III type without loader's visor, but the recoil
gear casing and armored protecting sleeve in front of the mantlet
are of the type provided on the Pz . Kpfw. IV. In a captured Model

MEDIUM TANKS
Medium tanks are those in the 22- to 40-ton weight class .
Although the Japanese have so-called medium tanks, they are lighter
than the American medium tanks and in the interest of fair comparison
have been compared with American light tanks . The German PzKw V and
VI are considered as heavy tanks .
The using services of our Army have built the Armored Force
around the Medium Tank, M4 . As in German tanks, the main armament
has, advanced from a relatively low-velocity 75x gun to a high-velocity
76 ma gun which has been standard in U . F- . medium tanks for over a year .
The 114 Shermen is famed for its tough armor, considering its weight
limitation of 3aâ¢ tons . It is considerably superior to the German
PzKw IV.
As many top commanders such as Patton and hovers have testified,
the greatly superior mechanical reliability and maneuverability under
most conditions, the power traverse, and the use of a gyrostabilizer,
have not only made the U. S . M4 tank superior to -the German PzCw IV
but also enabled our 30-ton medium tanks to outfight the heavy German
tanks .
To provide an assault tank with heavy frontal armor for use in
ETO, a number of M4A3E2 tanks with a frontal armor basis of 6 1/2 -
10"" have been produced. Reports indicate they have been highly
successful for the purpose intended .
The Japanese have tanks in this weight class, but they have
never been encountered in action and no reliable technical data
are available .
MEDIUM TANKS
Pz. Kpfw. IV Aus. A. B, C, D, E (Sd. Kfz. 161)
Weighing up to 24 tons in battle array, it is the standard German
medium tank. Ten models, A, B, C, D, E, F, F2 , G,'--H, K, are
known to have been produced. All models utilize the same suspension
arrangement of eight evenly spaced bogie wheels, 181/2
inches in diameter, sprung in pairs on each side, with four return
rollers. All models mount the 7.5 cm Kw. K. except Models F 2 and
G, which mount the 7.5 cm Kw. K . 40 . The chassis of this tank is
used as a self-propelled mount for heavier guns, such as the
""Hornet,"" the ""Bee, ' and the ""Grizzly Bear.""
Model A-An early experimental type. It weighed 20 tons,
unladen, and had a 5-speed transmission (S .F.G. 75) and an H .L .
108 T.R. Maybach engine.
Model B-The first model to bear the standard Pz . Kw. IV type
number Sd . Kfz . 161. This model had a new type of 6-speed transmission
(S .S.G. 76) and an improved H .L. 120 T.R.M. Maybach
engine
Model C-Distinguishable from Model B by its ""wish-bone""
aerial deflector. It was the first model to have an armored sleeve
protecting the turret machine gun, and the front plate of its superstructure
extends straight across the tank in one piece .
Model D-The fixed outer gun mantlet is dispensed with and
the moving portion is fitted with a thick front shield, the edges of
which overlap and protect the mantlet joints . The driver's compartment
extends farther forward than the machine gunner's
compartment. The basic armor in this model is 30 mm in thickness
in front and 20 mm on the sides . Its unladen weight is 20 1/2 tons.
Model E-Distinguishable from the Model D by its new type
of front driving sprocket, and by the new design of shutter (single
hinge) on the driver's visor. The nose plate armor is increased
from 30 mm to 50 mm. Weight is 21.5 tons, unladen.

Model F-The hull, superstructure, and turret, as in all other
known models of the Pz. Kpfw. N, is of welded construction . The
basic frontal armor, including superstructure and turret of Model F,
was increased to 50 mm ; on the sides to 30 mm. The main hull
superstructure projects over the top of the tracks, providing additional
stowage space and a wide base upon which to mount the
turret. The turret floor is carried by brackets from the turret ring
and consequently rotates with the turret .
The suspension consists of 4 bogie assemblies, each fitted with
two rubber-tired bogie wheels 18V2 inches in diameter on each
side, with a quarter elliptic spring anchored beneath the leading
axle arm of each assembly . There is a front sprocket, the spokes of
which are bent outward from the hub cap giving the outside a
dished appearance, a rear idler which has 7 spokes instead of 8
as in previous models, and 4 return rollers .
The power plant consists of a Maybach HL 120 TRM, V-12
O.H.V., 4-stroke, gasoline engine, rated 320 B .H.P . at 3,000 r.p.m.
The armament consists of a 7 .5 cm Kw. K., 24 cals . in length, a
coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 mounted in the turret, and a 7 .92 mm
MG 34 at the right of the front plate of the superstructure .
Model F2-Same as Model F except that it carried the initial
experimental mounting of the Kw . K. 40, 43 c als. in length.
Model G-Produced in 1942 . Same as Model F except that the
mounting of the Kw . K. 40 was continued . The gun was fitted
with a double baffle muzzle brake .

HEAVY TANK ""Tiger""
Pz. Kpfw. ""Tiger"" (8 .8 cm Kw. K. 36 L/56) (Sd. Kfz. 181)
The Pz. Kpfw . VI was introduced into service by Germany in
the latter part of 1942 .
Its construction incorporates a notable departure from past
German practice in that the superstructure is welded to the main
hull instead of being bolted . The use of heavy armor called for
flat plates wherever possible, resulting in a simple box-like contour.
Another interesting development in construction' involves
plate interlocking, secured by welding, in addition to the normal
step jointing . This has no doubt been made necessary by the use
of thicker armor, which ranges from 102 mm in the front nose
plate to 92 mm in the cast steel gun mantlet . and 80 mm in the
side superstructure .
The hull is divided into four compartments. The floor of the
fighting compartment is suspended from and rotates with the
turret. The turret is centrally mounted between the hull side
plates. A circular fixed cupola, with an inside diameter of 20
inches, is mounted in the turret roof.
The suspension consists of front sprocket, rear idler, and eight
triple, rubber-tired bogie wheels 31 1/2 inches in diameter sprung
on torsion bars . The wheel assemblies straddle each other in such
a manner that the outer rims of four of the wheels on each side
may be removed to accommodate the narrow (20 1/2 inch) transportation
track. For combat a wider (28'/2 inch) track is utilized .
The mechanical layout follows orthodox German practice .
The Maybach, V-12, 642 hp. engine is mounted centrally at the
rear.
The armament consists of an electrically fired 8.8 cm Kw.K. 36
with coaxial 7 .92 mm MG 34 in the turret, a ball-mounted MG 34
in the vertical plate, a 9 mm machine gun stowed, six smoke
generators, and three mine throwers mounted on the superstructure
roof. The existence of a Model ""P"" has also been reported .

out by the fact that 83 per cent of the Mk V and VI German tanks were
destroyed by gun fire as compared to 67 per cent for American M4 and 59
per cent for German Uk III and IV . The minor importance of shoulder
rocket guns in evidenced by the low percentage of tanks destroyed by their

The American aims more for final drive -than the German . On the side shots,
the German is still shooting at the spot on the forward sponson in which
ammunition we. stored in early U4 tanks. It is evident from this study
that either the American 75mm gun or the 76mm gun is capable of destroying
any German tank.

SELF-PROPELLED HOWITZERS - LIGHT
Early in this war the value of mounting guns larger than 75mm
on a tank chassis was appreciated, and the 105am Howitzer on the medium
tank chassis was . developed and produced in time to take part in the
battles of Africa . The first model was designated the 105mm Howitzer
Motor Carriage, M7, and nicknamed the ""Priest"" . The M37, an approved
version, is now standard .
Although, designed primarily for use as artillery, this weapon
can be used effectively against tanks with its HEAT (shaped-charge)
ammmmition . The 105mm howitzer is not turret mounted and has only a
limited traverse. The vehicle also mounts a cal . .50 machine gun in a ring
mount for antiaircraft protection and for use against light ground targets .
The success of the 105mm howitzer in this chassis has led to the installation
of a number of 105mm howitzer in later models of the 94 tank (see
Medium Tanks) .
The Germans have mounted 105mm howitzers on both their ? w II
aack-Sz.Ew III chassis . There is also scant information concerning a
105mabrowitzer mounted on the modified chassis of the PzKw IV Medium Tank .
Up to the present time the Japanese have not used any weapons
similar to these against our forces .
The German and U . S . 105mm howitzers are about equal. . The U .S.
self-propelled mounts have the advantage of superior reliability of the
tank components on which they are based .

S .P . ASSAULT GUN
Sturmgeschutz 7.5 cm K. (Sd . Kfz. 142)
The Sturmgeschutz is an assault weapon. Unlike the two
other classes of self-propelled guns, antitank and artillery, which
consist merely of guns placed in the hull of a tank with shields
erected around the front and sides thereof, the assault gun is built
into the hull and is consequently nearer the ground and has a
much more solid superstructure built round the gun. The original
Sturmgeschutz consisted of the turretless chassis of a Pz. Kpfw. III
tank, upon which was mounted the Stu . G. 7.5 cm K., a short-barreled
(69 .5 inch) piece found in the first models of the Pz. Kpfw .
IV. Since the power plant and other mechanical components of the
chassis of the Sturmgeschutz are identical to those of the Pz . Kpfw.
III tank, and their weights are approximately the same, the
performance data of the two are comparable .
The turret of the original tank has been removed and replaced
by a squat superstructure, reducing the height of the vehicle from
8 feet, 3 inches as a tank to 6 feet, 5 inches as an assault weapon,.
The gun compartment is roofed over, but there is no rotating turret .
The fighting compartment is armored as follows : front 53 mm,
sides 43 mm, top 11 mm .
The gun, which is mounted low in the hull and fires forward,
is identical to the 7.5 cm Kpfw. K. short tank gun, originally the
main armament of the Pz. Kpfw. IV tank . It is primarily a close
support weapon, the ammunition scale comprising only 25% A.P .
against 10% smoke and 65% H.E . ; its armor-piercing performance
is relatively poor. Its muzzle velocity and maximum range firing
H.E . shell is 1,378 f. s. and 6,758 yards, respectively. The penetration
of A .P.C.B.C. shell against homogeneous armor is reported as
follows : 500 yards, 1 .81 inches at 30Â° obliquity, 2 .16 inches normal
-1000 yards, 1 .61 inches at 30Â° . 1.97 inches normal-1,200 yards,
1 .57 inches at 30', 1 .89 inches normal.

SELF-PROPELLRD GUNS AND HOWITZERS, MEDIUM, 150 - 155tmg
The Germans have used in this war a number of improvised selfpropelled
howitzers in the 150mm class . The most frequently encountered
are :
15cm BIG 33 mounted on the Pzkw I and Pzkw II chassis,
15am SFR 18 mounted on the Pzkw IV chassis,
16cm STUII 43, also mounted on the Pskw IV chassis .
The Japanese have one self-propelled 15cm howitzer on a medium
tank chassis . The maximum range of any of these weapons is approximately
15,000 yards .
Early in the war, the Orananoe Department developed the 155mm
Gun Motor Carriage, M12, using the World War type 156m (1PF, which
had a maximum range of 20,100 yards. One hundred of these were
manufactured but there were no immediate requirements. Experience
in France showed the great value of highly mobile self-propelled
artillery of this size, and urgent requirements were then submitted
for the improved type recently standardized as the 155m Gun Motor
Carriage, M40 (T83) . The M40 mounts the 156m Gun, Ml, which has a
maximum range of 26 .715-yards . The older 3112 fired the first shot
into Germany and the new M40 fired the first shot into Cologne .
Also recently standardized is the 155m Howitzer Motor Carriage,
U41, (T64E1) .
Tiese U. S. weapons, which are mounted on medium tank chassis,
demonstrate how successfully large weapons can be mounted on mobile
ohassis to meet the specific needs of the using services.
S .P. HEAVY INFANTRY HOWITZER
Gw. II fur 15 cm s. I. G. 33
This vehicle consists of the 15 cm . heavy infantry howitzer
mounted in the hull of a modified, turretless Pz. Kpfw. II chassis.
The chassis is approximately three feet longer than -that of the
standard Pz Kw II tank and has six bogie wheels instead of the
usual five . The sprockets, rear idlers, bogie wheels, return rollers,
steering assembly, gear box and hull nose are those of the Pz .

The hardest thing for my squad to do is
stay together .
Men in the States should be 'trained to
dig foxholes. It will save lives . Foxholes
are better than slit trenches because they
protect a man more and you can fire out of
a foxhole and you can't very well out of a
slit trench .
If I went to the States to train men, the
first thing I would stress to a new man is
leadership . I would make the man have
confidence in his leader, and train him in
every weapon, camouflage, and to dig foxholes;
also to cover up tin cans. (Tin cans
reflect light and give away positions .)
INfERV/EW5 AT THE r""RONT
If you are going to harden a soldier up,
keep him hardened up and don't let him get
soft. Start hard training and keep it up . Men
should be hardened before they go into combat.
Physical training on a boat is fine, but
weapon training is wasted.
Flares should be used at night to confuse
the enemy. They are very effective. You
should also fire . machine guns .-at, night even
if you don't see the, enemy. =It - has. a. very
effective demoralizing effect on the enemy .
In the States we didn't have enough night
training. Men should be trained in the use
of stars for navigation. All men should be
trained to know organization in the States.

the only other counter-battery fire .
We have the most need for training in the
.30 and .50 caliber machine guns. We have
men who don't even know their nomenclature
and functioning .
OLONEL RINGSOK: Many recruits have

SERGEANT MAHONEY: Training in bivouac

It keeps them refreshed on nomenclature .
Not all our men could read a compass or
a map. Our new officers are medium good

There should be a oleman stove in each

OLONEL RINGSOK: Before an action, we
assemble the squad and platoon leaders and
give them the `big picture .' When the platoon
commanders become casualties, 30% were at
El Guetter, there is no one to give them the
big picture then. And it helps to know who
is on your right and left and what they are
doing . This class, I believe, has paid big

The enemy will shell you from his tanks

OLONEL RINGSOK: We've had to run a

good.
We did more damage to the vehicles in
the 40 miles cross-country east of El Guettar
and the 70 miles coming out of Kasserine
than was done in all the other 4000 miles .
The men must be impressed with the importance
of taking enough ammunition and
44
other supplies every time they detruck .
They're too slow in detrucking . Equipment
must be ready at all times to detruck . Men
are too unwilling to leave the half-track-it
means they have to carry their own stuff.
We have enough equipment, but it's not
always in the proper place. At Medjez we

The organization of the unit should be

a forward and a rear command post. The
battalion commanding officer should be with
the forward command post.
Frankness with your subordinate leaders
is the biggest thing in leadership. The officer
should be truthful . If he doesn't know,
he should admit to the noncommissioned

the fine spirit and morale shown, the enthusiastic

The command post was well located
in a draw between two hills . Although the
command post was located between two artillery
fires-the fire of the enemy on one side
and the English fire on the other-none of it
came in to us . This was the situation from
the latter part of the morning until about
1600 hours. At this time, the English started
to build fires for cooking purposes . In addition,
the artillery observer and his assistant,
who were directing the English fire, came on
to the sky line and directed fire from there .
It wasn't more than fifteen or twenty minutes
before German artillery fire began to
land in the command post. As a matter of

Our people don't understand terrain . They
think they are hidden, and then find themselves
in direct fire.

fired through each grove with high

have a half-assed idea of where to look for

LIEUTENANT OLONEL LOUIS A. HAMMA K,
751st Tank Battalion (M), Fondouk, 13 April
1943.
I believe there should be a definite battle
formation; the infantry following the
second wave of tanks and preceding the last
wave. This is necessary so that the tanks may
be able to knock out any machine guns that
/WrERV/EW5 AT THE FRONT
are missed by the leading waves, and then
open fire behind the advancing infantry .
I have what is known as the regular formation,
in which I have one company to support
the other two companies going on the
objective. The supporting company fires
either direct or indirect . One company goes
to the right, and one company to the left . The
right company, using fire and movement by
platoons, covers the whole objective, while
the left company gives close, direct support
by fire . The left company then crosses the objective
in the opposite direction and takes position
to support the other two companies on
the next objective. In the meantime, as soon
as the support company's fire is masked, it
proceeds on the right to the second objective.
When the final or main objective is taken, we
rally well forward, and if no further instructions
are given, we return to the . reservicing
position.
The formations- : right and left are-the'
same in -principle except when the terrain is
such that two companies can initially- go to
the right or. -left. .As: soon- as we coth under-'
fire, 'the companies : always 'advance .-by- pla:
toons, using fire and movement .
The terrain was flat, the objective was
high, and the enemy had direct observation
on us during the entire advance . It was a distance
of about 3,12' miles .
It was impossible for the tanks to go on
top of the objective. We surrounded the objective
and got as far as we could, the idea
being to support the infantry in their steep
climb . It was some two hundred feet high, and
it was rocky.
Once we attacked parallel to some very
high hills to clear out some enemy emplacements.
We ran into machine guns, received
antitank and artillery fire, and were divebombed
.
51
The dive-bomber hit one disabled tank,
and we lost another tank that got stuck in a
wadi. It was covered by artillery and machine
gun fire, and was set afire by the enemy . In
all, two tanks lost and one man wounded .
What damage was done, and what amount of
tanks did you lose due to mines, artillery, etc.
in the last attacks?
In the first attack we lost seven ; four by
mines and three by antitank guns. In the
second and third attacks we lost fourteen ;
three of those by antitank guns, and the
others by artillery and mines and mechanical
failures (two tanks ran together) .*
Do you know if the Diesel would be a handicap
in any way?
No but they should be in line .
How were your replacements?
The replacements so far have been very
good. They came from the 2nd Armored
Division.
On the march, what about antiaircraft defense?
We.-have been vo.ferrtuyn,ta t,e o -have a ..
'battery' .of antia-ircraft attached to us, and .
they have shot down three ',or f.our""-pla'nes
They have the 40-mm and also the .50 caliber
gun. The .50 caliber gun is a good antiaircraft
weapon .
You keep plenty of distance between your vehicles?
Yes.
What is that distance?
Seventy-five yards on the march. One
hundred yards in bivouac.
Did your riflemen fire at planes?
Everything was fired-pistols, rifles, machine
guns, and everything else .
Â°NOTE : The objective was finally reached by
the infantry, taking 133 Germans and no Italians .

"with his armoured divisions,
but from the enemys perspective TOTALIZE had ripped open prepared defences
and forced Dietrich to try and organize a new position to block the advance to
Falaise. The 271st Infantry Division was ordered to disengage with the British
troops in the Orne bridgehead and take over positions from north of Thury-
Harcourt to the River Laize.23 The 89th Division, which had lost about half its
combat troops, was to establish contact with the 271st at the Laize and hold the
Urville-Bretteville-le-Rabet area. Heinrichs created an ad hoc unit out of his
supply troops to reinforce the right flank, and co-ordinated his plans with elements
of 12th SS.24 To the east, the 272nd Division was responsible for the area St-
Slyvain-Vimont.
Dietrich and Eberbach wanted these positions held until 85th Division,
due to arrive in the next thirty-six hours, had dug in on a new defensive line to be
created north of the Laison. Eberbach persuaded von Kluge to transfer two Panzer
battle groups, one of which deployed twelve Tigers, to reinforce Dietrichs corps.25
While von Kluge juggled his forces, Simonds ordered his armoured divisions to
press on by night aided by searchlights.26
Three battle groups attempted to carry out these orders. The Poles cleared
the hamlet of Robertmesnil and a nearby woods but did not attempt a further
advance. Halpenny Force (Canadian Grenadier Guards and the Lake Superior
Regiment [Motorized]) reached its first objective, Bretteville-le-Rabet and fought
a sustained action to secure it, capturing over 200 prisoners. Worthington Force
(the British Columbia and Algonquin Regiments), tasked to seize Hill 195 west of
the Caen-Falaise highway, lost direction and ended up five kilometres to the east
on Pt. 140. They reported that they were on their objective, a mistake that
prevented the medium artillery from providing fire support.
Simonds ability to influence the battle at the sharp end was limited by
RAF directives on the employment of tactical air. Early on the morning of
9 August, Worthington and his men watched as two Typhoons circled overhead
63
and then let fly with their rockets and machine guns. When recognition panels
were displayed and yellow smoke was burned, the planes rocked their wings in
acknowledgement [and] returned at half hour intervals all day long rocketing and
strafing the enemy.27 There was, however, no method of communicating with the
men on the ground; nor was there any procedure for informing brigade, divisional,
or corps headquarters about the situation.
The American 9th Tactical Air Force (9TAF) had begun the battle for
Normandy by employing a doctrine closely modelled on the one developed by the
RAF, but was far more willing to learn from experience than the RAFs 2TAF. By
late July its commander, Major-General Pete Quesada, had implemented a system
known as Armoured Column Cover, which enabled direct communication
between aircraft assigned to an armoured command and an air officer with the
tanks.28 This system was employed to good effect after the Cobra breakout, yet
it was unacceptable to the RAF, which resisted all attempts to tie air resources to
specific army formations or to establish direct communication between tactical
ground commanders and the tactical air force. Much is made of the RAF system
of cab rank, which allowed air officers attached to army units to call down air
strikes on specific targets, but this was a poor substitute for intimate cooperation
of the kind that was developed between American ground forces and their tactical
air groups. If the BCR [British Columbia Regiment]-Algonquin battle group had
been an American formation, it would have had no difficulty identifying its
location or relaying information to the corps commander well before it was
destroyed by the enemy.
Simonds, unhappy with what he saw as excessive caution on the part of
the armoured divisions, ordered the Poles to seize Pt. 140, cross the Laison, and
clear the south bank of the river. The Canadians were told to secure the high
ground west of the highway as far south as Pt. 206 and exploit to Falaise.29
Lieutenant-Colonel Dave Stewart, CO of the Argylls, was quite prepared to try and
fulfill the general intent of his orders, but not by the sacrifice of his battalion.
When told that the Argylls were to seize Pt. 195, he and his scout platoon
reconnoitred a circuitous route around the enemy defences and posted scouts
along the way to ensure that no one got lost. Company locations on the objective
were selected from the map, as were anti-tank gun positions. The men muffled
their equipment and moved in single file as silently as possible. At 0430 hours,
just before first light, the Argylls were digging in in preparation for counterattacks.
The Lincs (the Lincoln and Welland Regiment) occupied Pt. 180
protecting the right flank.30
East of the highway, the Polish Armoured Division, unable to deal with
the tanks of the 12th SS, had spent the day fighting for St-Sylvain and Soignolles.
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
64
Totalize and Tractable
Shortly after midnight the liaison office at General Maczeks headquarters
reported that an attempt to capture the Pt. 140 feature had been repulsed by an
enemy counter-attack of an estimated 40 tanks. The woods to the south were
thought to be strongly held.31 The Poles were attempting to advance into positions
that the 12th SS was holding while 85th Division completed its deployment.
Simonds was determined to continue the offensive on 4th Divisions front,
so he issued orders to push the armour through the Argylls to Pt. 206. The
Grenadier Guards were in the process of carrying out a cautious, phased move to
Pt. 195 when they were told to prepare a co-ordinated daylight attack with
artillery. However, they got no further than the cornfield to the north of Point
195 before 88 fire from the left flank and a counter-attack, which included robot
tanks, ended any thought of further advance.32 The Argylls and Lincs had been
dealing with counter-attacks since dawn, but with the men dug in, anti-tank guns
in place, artillery DF tasks arranged, and Typhoons available, the enemy suffered
heavy losses trying to retake Hill 195.33
A similar fate awaited the Queens Own Rifles (QOR) and North Shores.
Simonds knew that 85th Division had begun to arrive in strength, so he gambled
that a hastily arranged attack on Quesnay Woods might gain control of the area
before the enemy was ready. His CCRA arranged to employ the guns of four field
regiments and two AGRAs, but in the absence of any detailed knowledge of
enemy positions, the fire plan could not produce sufficient density in any one area
to do more than temporarily suppress enemy fire. Acting brigadier Jock Spragge
received his orders less than four hours before the attack. The divisional recce
regiment reported that the woods were strongly held, and Spragge had few
illusions about the difficultly of the assignment he had been given. The battalions
were told to sweep the woods southeast from the village of Quesnay, but this
proved utterly impossible.34 According to German sources, Quesnays guns and
mortars were defended by two hundred Panzer Grenadiers and as many as twentythree
tanks, with the infantry dug in along the forward edge of the woods.35 Both
the QORs and the North Shores suffered significant casualties in a gruesome battle
that lasted well into the night.
Operation TOTALIZE came to an end in the Quesnay Woods as Simonds
decided to pause and re-organize. Early on the morning of 11 August he issued
new orders, which included an outline of a break-in attack to be made under
cover of a smoke screen with infantry carried forward in Priests. This was to take
place in seventy-two hours; the 4th Canadian and 1st Polish Divisions were to be
withdrawn while the infantry divisions took over the defence of the deep salient
that had been created in the past three days.36 The human cost of TOTALIZE
included more than 600 Canadian dead  the inevitable price of a large-scale
65
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
66
offensive. It was estimated that the enemy lost over 3,000 men, including
1,270 taken prisoner and a similar number killed in action.37
By any reasonable standard, TOTALIZE was a very successful operation.
The corps had broken through a strong defensive position manned by a fresh, fullstrength
infantry division and advanced 14 kilometres toward Falaise. The
breakthrough did not become a breakout because 89th Division fought with
considerable skill, as did the battle groups of 12th SS. The arrival of the lead
elements of 85th Division on 10 August added significantly to the enemys
strength and convinced commanders on both sides that the new defensive position
north of the Laison could be held against improvised attacks. It was time to pause
and reorganize.
Guy Simonds was never willing to accept such a realistic assessment of
TOTALIZE. On 13 August he organized a private talk with commanders down
to and including regimental COs.38 According to Major-General Kitching,
Simonds gave a very tough and unpleasant briefing in which he blasted
armoured regiments for their lack of support for infantry he demanded much
greater initiative from armd regts  drive on  get amongst the enemy etc. Forget
about harbouring at night  keep driving on. Arrange your supply accordingly.
Dont rely on the infantry to do everything for you.39
Preparations for TRACTABLE, the second great armoured assault on the
German defences north of Falaise, began on 12 August, when Simonds outlined
his concept to the divisional commanders. No formal operation order was issued;
instead, staff officers produced their own Outlines of Instructions to assist in the
planning. The primary object of TRACTABLE was to gain command of the
enemys communications through Falaise by seizing the high ground northeast of
the town. There was some uncertainty about subsequent objectives because
Montgomery kept changing his mind. When Simonds met with his officers on the
morning of 13 August, he noted that Falaise is only a name40  it was the eastwest
roads through the town that mattered. Unfortunately, Falaise was more than
a name to Montgomery, and Simonds was forced to include the capture of the
town in his initial plan. The object of TRACTABLE became to exploit southeastwards
and capture or dominate Trun, after the high ground north and east of
Falaise was secure.41
If Trun rather than Falaise had been the primary objective of
TRACTABLE, Simonds would surely have shifted the corps axis of advance to
the east to take advantage of the open country and good north-south roads between
Jort and St-Pierre-sur-Dives.42 Simonds was well aware of the opportunities on his
left flank. He ordered the Polish Armoured Division to form a special group for
Totalize and Tractable
67
reconnaissance in the area, and he moved the balance of that division into corps
reserve, but the Phase 2 objectives for TRACTABLE were unchanged.43 This
meant that 4th Division was to turn west toward Falaise, into the heart of the
German defences, instead of continuing south to Trun and closing much of the
gap. On the morning of 13 August, Simonds explained his plan to the divisional
and brigade commanders. The problem, he noted, was exactly the same as in
TOTALIZE  to obtain a breakthrough in sufficient depth to push past the enemys
gun screen and to set the armour behind his positions so as to deny him freedom
of manoeuverability. (The text of his appreciation is reproduced at the end of this
chapter.)
TRACTABLE was much more than a replay of TOTALIZE; it
incorporated lessons learned and proposed new and innovative ideas. There was,
however, one serious flaw  the failure to appreciate that the Laison River, little
more than a small creek by Canadian standards, was in fact a serious tank obstacle.
An after-action report issued by 2nd Armoured Brigade suggested that in future,
tank commanders rather than engineers ought to be consulted when deciding what
was likely to be a tank obstacle.44
The Canadian attack struck directly at 85th Infantry Division, which was
positioned on the reverse slope of the high ground north of the Laison River. The
85th was as good an infantry division as the Germans possessed at this stage of
the war. Raised in February 1944, with cadres drawn from veterans of the Eastern
Front, it had ample time to train while serving with 15th Army in the Somme
sector.45 The division was responsible for an 8-kilometre sector from Quesnay
Woods to Mazières, and it deployed both its infantry regiments north of the
Laison. The divisional artillery, some of the anti-tank guns, and the Fusilier
battalion were south of the river. So was each regiments reserve battalion. But
the decision to concentrate most of the divisions combat troops and many of the
Flak Corps 88s north of the river played into Simonds hands. The enemys
inability to mount any kind of serious counterattack when the Canadians were at
their most vulnerable (i.e., while waiting to cross the Laison) indicated just how
successful TRACTABLE was at penetrating a heavily defended reverse-slope
position.
It is again important to note that the defence of the Laison was conducted
by 1st SS Panzer Corps, not by Kurt Meyer and 12th SS, which played only a
marginal role in TRACTABLE. The approach to the Laison began precisely at
1140 hours, when the message Move Now was relayed. The artillery and waves
of medium bombers had been at work for thirty minutes before the lead tanks
crossed the startline. On the right flank, the Fort Garry Horse advanced in the
approved fashion, two squadrons abreast. They burst through the forward
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
68
defences, enjoying a great run over open country with the tank gunners taking all
likely targets by speculative shooting. On reaching the river near Montboint,
they encountered anti-tank guns, including 88s cutting down good sized trees.
A crossing was improvised, and then a usable bridge was discovered. Most of the
regiment got across the river, and by 1700 hours the advance was resumed. The
Garrys were pretty well on their own, and even though the area was stiff with
anti-tank guns and pockets of infantry, they fought their way through, reaching
their first objective at 2230 hours. The Garrys lost almost one-third of their tanks
and suffered a number of crew casualties, but the extraordinary determination of
the regiment led to a considerable success.46
The 1st Hussars struck more determined resistance north of the river. As
one squadron commander reported, it was essential to maintain speed for any
hesitation was rewarded by determined attacks from enemy infantry. The
Hussars also ran into German tanks, and reported destroying two Tigers. The lead
squadrons lost direction and ended up well to the east in 4th Armoured Brigades
zone. The enemy continued to contest every move, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Colwell described the fighting on the river bottom as the most hectic of the
operation. Never, he remarked, had the regiment killed so many of the enemy or
thrown so many hand grenades. In addition, hundreds of prisoners were taken.
The Hussars reached their initial objective to the east of the Garrys during the
night, but by then the regiment was at half-strength.47
The 4th Armoured Brigade advanced with the two Guards regiments
leading, followed closely by the BCRs and Lake Superior Regiment (Lake Sups).
There was ample room, and each regiment deployed all three squadrons up, over
an 800 metre front. By now many of the tanks were festooned with extra armour
made out of loosely attached tank tracks. The neat formations quickly collapsed
as smoke, dust, uneven ground and enemy resistance were encountered. In the
woods south of Pt. 140, the Foot Guards ran into an enemy strongpoint that had
escaped the medium bombers. The approaches were mined, and both MK IV
tanks and anti-tank guns had to be dealt with while the rest of the regiment passed
on. In the river valley a series of miniature close engagements took place that
resulted in losses on both sides and many enemy prisoners.48 The confusion on
this part of the front was compounded by the greater width of the Laison, which
turned improvised crossings into tank traps.
The main crossing point at Rouvres had to be shared with the Hussars and
the BCRs, but small groups edging east found intact bridges at Maizières, Ernes
(which was vaguely in our hands),49 and Ifs-sur-Laison, well to the east of the
divisional boundary. The road to Trun was wide open but the assigned objectives
were still at Falaise. Attempts to reorganize the scattered squadrons were
Totalize and Tractable
69
complicated by the loss of Brigadier Booth, who was wounded in action, and by
the need to transfer command to Lieutenant-Colonel Scott of the Foot Guards.50
However, the squadron and troop commanders knew their jobs, and the immediate
objectives at Olendon-Sassy were secured despite continued resistance and losses
from anti-tank guns. Fortunately, the BCRs and Lake Sups moved forward to
help. Just outside Sassy, the Lake Sups encountered a large enemy force and
captured 250 prisoners.51
While the armoured brigades were fighting their way onto the high ground
south of the Laison, the two mounted infantry brigades cleared the valley behind.
This was 3rd Divisions first experience riding into battle, and apart from bruises
from the rough ride, the troops were exhilarated by their part in the charge of the
light brigade.52 Resistance in the eastern, 8th Brigade sector was scattered; the
biggest problem was enemy artillery and mortar fire.53 To the west, 9th Brigade
found the area, where the Garrys had broken through, alive with enemy infantry
and at least two Tiger tanks.
While the battles of the Laison raged, Bomber Command struck
accurately at Quesnay Woods and the targets around Potigny, but 77 of the 811
bombers misidentified their targets and wreaked havoc among Canadian and
Polish troops in the rear areas. The short bombing had no direct effect on the
forces committed to TRACTABLE, most of whom only learned of the tragedy the
next day. The vast majority of the bomber crews identified their targets correctly,
and accurate bombing devastated the enemy anchor position in Quesnay Woods as
well as areas held by 89th Division east of the highway.54
By the evening of 14 August it was apparent that though both armoured
brigades were firm on their intermediate objectives, a continued advance to the
high ground overlooking Falaise would have to wait until morning. On the
British-Canadian front west of Falaise, leading troops were 8 to 10 kilometres
from town. But the main Falaise-St-Pierre-sur-Dives road was still available to
the enemy, as were the two other east-west routes through the town.
Montgomerys report to London, timed at 2200 hours, noted this reality and
offered the opinion that, although a good many enemy had escaped eastwards,
a good many were still inside the ring. His solution was to order Bradley to
stop the enemy from turning southeast [as] we want those who escaped us here to
be pushed against the Seine.55 Montgomery made no move to reinforce the First
Canadian Army or to change the orders directing 2nd Canadian Corps to Falaise.
His decision to stop Patton at Argentan on 12-13 August might be defended as
prudent in view of reports of an impending counter-attack, but thirty-six hours
later no such attack had occurred. Why was Montgomery unwilling to order the
Americans to resume their advance north? Even if the Canadians reached Falaise
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
70
Totalize and Tractable
71
the next day, the enemy could still use a number of secondary roads north of
Argentan to leave the pocket. The most likely answer is that Montgomery no
longer believed the enemy could be encircled at Argentan-Falaise, and was intent
on trapping those who had escaped the air forces at the Seine. This left the
Canadians with the unbelievable task of trying to block the exodus of tens of
thousands of German troops determined to avoid entrapment. On the morning of
15 August they discovered just how difficult this was going to be. The 12th SS
Division had been ordered to employ its surviving units to provide anti-tank
support to the four infantry divisions holding positions north of Falaise. The
combat strength of the 85th, 89th, 271st and 272nd Divisions had been reduced by
at least 50 per cent, but all four divisional headquarters still exercised good
control, and cooperated in creating a continuous line of strongpoints north of the
Condé-Falaise-St-Pierre-sur-Dives highway.56
TRACTABLE is usually described as an operational failure because it
failed to meet Simonds expectations.57 It should be noted, however, that if 4th
Division had captured the high ground northeast of Falaise and then entered the
city, the stated objective  to advance to Trun  would have been further delayed.
TRACTABLE ought to have been a great success. The Canadians broke through
the best-organized defensive position left to the Germans in Normandy and on 14
August achieved the long-sought freedom to manoeuvre armoured divisions at the
operational level. Montgomerys orders to take Falaise before exploiting to Trun
sidetracked 4th Division.
On the morning of 15 August, Simonds ordered the Polish Armoured
Division to move around the enemy defences and seize the crossings over the
River Dives at Jort and Vendouvre.58 If successful, this would open the way to
Trun and outmanoeuvre the enemy dug-in around Falaise. The Poles started east
at 1100 hours, moving in two columns over the Caen-Falaise highway and cutting
through the rear areas of 3rd and 4th divisions. The Poles operated with their
divisional recce regiment, 10th Mounted Rifles, out in front, and it was the 10th
that reconnoitred the crossings and after their daring capture went on to Courcy.
While Montgomery and Bradley concentrated on the long envelopment at
the Seine, the German commanders were preparing to evacuate the remaining
troops  around 100,000  who were still in the pocket. The Allied landings in the
south of France on 15 August had convinced Hitler that Normandy  perhaps all
of France  was lost, and he authorized an immediate withdrawal behind the
Dives. To accomplish this, both Argentan and Falaise were, he insisted, to be held
as corner pillars.59
The enemy had made enormous sacrifices in the struggle to hold Falaise

and the northern shoulder of the pocket. Since 8 August, the First Canadian Army
had destroyed the combat power of two fresh, full-strength infantry divisions and
further weakened three others, including 12th SS. According to the headquarters
of 1st SS Panzer Corps, by noon on 15 August, 85th Division could muster only
one-and-a-half battalions of infantry and a battery of 88 mm guns. The 89th, 271st,
and 272nd were only slightly better off, and the Hitler Youth were said to have
only fifteen tanks left.60 The German army had maintained a cohesive front in the
British and Canadian sectors, but at a price no army could afford to pay.
Montgomerys nightly message reflected his continuing commitment to
pushing the enemy up against the Seine. His major initiative was to send 7th
Armoured Division across the river at St-Pierre-sur-Dives and then turn it in a
northeasterly direction to Lisieux. Closing the gap was still not a priority, and
Ultra reported that five of the six Panzer and SS divisions, still inside the pocket,
were planning to break out between Argentan and Sees. The Americans,
Montgomery believed, would have to concentrate on holding this attack. He did
mention the Canadians: If we can get 2nd British Army tomorrow to Putanges
and the left wing of 2 Canadian Corps to Trun we shall be pretty well placed. The
balance of his report dealt with plans for swinging detachments from 20 U.S.
Corps up onto the Seine.61
One of the greatest weaknesses of Ultra intelligence was that it provided
strong evidence of enemy intentions but only indirect evidence of capabilities.
Hitler had ordered a breakout south of Argentan, but von Kluge insisted it was
impossible, so as we have seen, Hitler agreed to a withdrawal behind the Dives on
the afternoon of 16 August.62 This was to take place along the highways through
Trun, Chambois, and Gacé, and along the secondary roads paralleling the main
escape routes.63
Most accounts of Montgomerys actions on 16 August suggest that he
ordered Bradley to push on from Argentan towards Trun and Chambois,64 but
there is no direct evidence for this. What we do know is that the confused
command situation at Argentan, involving the transfer of authority from the Third
to the First U.S. Army, prevented any such attack from taking place for the next
forty-eight hours.65 This meant that the burden of blocking the enemys desperate
drive to escape encirclement would be borne by Simonds two understrength
armoured divisions and the tactical air forces. This situation was the result of a
series of misjudgements made by Montgomery and Bradley. Though it is possible
to understand the choices they made, it is clear that they were responsible for
command decisions that offered the enemy ample opportunity to escape
encirclement.

"ition,
he may so state and the battalion commander gives the
company commander authority to adjust fire . If the artillery
forward observer should become a casualty, either the
battalion commander or the company commander may
adjust fire .
(4) In order that all officers may be able to adjust fire, the
battalion commander in his attack order designates a series
of check points and easily identifiable terrain features, and
numbers them consecutively in the direction of advance . To
distinguish check points for the various artillery battalions,
the check points for the lower numbered artillery battalion
begins with 100, the next higher 200, and the highest number
300. Company commanders number these check points on
their maps .
b . Air support,-(1) Air bombardment is used to supplement
artillery fires and to attack targets beyond the range of
artillery. The use of air bombardment should be coordinated
with artillery fire .
(2) The battalion commander has on his staff an officer
called the S-3 for air . When the battalion is making the
main effort or is the first echelon of attack this officer is
mounted in a half-track vehicle, equipped with long-range
radio, from the division signal company .
(3) Should air support be needed and the signal company
long-range radio is not available, the battalion commander
may arrange through his regiment or the combat command
for air support .
(4) If air support is desired, ask for it at the earliest practicable
moment . It takes time to get the planes to the right
place .
c . Mortar fires For employment of mortars see FM 17-27,
The mortars should be retained under battalion control when
the attack is on a narrow front. When the front becomes so
wide that mortar support cannot be given leading companies
by retention under battalion control, attach them to companies
.
d . Assault gun,-For employment of the assault gun platoon
see FM 17-25 . The same principle of attachment which
75
31-33
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
governs the mortar platoon also governs the assault gun
platoon.
e. Supporting tanks.-Medium tanks from another battalion
may be used to support the attack either by direct or
indirect fire . The reserve company should be used to support
the attack by fire . Do not attempt to lay down extensive
artillery preparations with the medium tanks ; the ammunition
carried will not permit such action . (See FM 17-32 .)
f . Infantry weapons.-When attacking with infantry, the
infantry weapons are used to give fire support for the tanks .
(See par. 32 and FM 17-10, 17-40, and 17-42 .)
â 32 . COORDINATION .-Careful planning, perfect coordination
and timing, and vigorous execution are essentials of a successful
attack . The effect of all elements-tanks, infantry,
artillery, and air-must be coordinated .
a . In a meeting engagement coordination is difficult. (See
par . 34 .) However, in an attack from assembly position on
an enemy whose location has been determined, the maximum
of coordination must be attained .
b . Coordination is obtained by explicit orders, designation
of time or signal for attack, and designation of a line or lines
of departure . Commanders concerned or their staff officers
must confer and make certain that each knows what, when .
where, and how he is to operate.
c. The regimental or combat command commander is responsible
for coordination of the attack as a whole . However,
the battalion commander must confer with the infantry
commander, the artillery commander or his liaison officer, and
the commander of supporting tanks . He makes all necessary
arrangements to insure that each knows what the other is to
do . He arranges for special signals and for any special radio
communication . This information must be passed on to the
lower units .
â 33 . POSITIONS .-Locations or positions which must be understood
by all are the assembly position, attack position,
rallying point, and alternate rallying point. In addition
separate tank battalions may use an intermediate position .
(See fg . 49 and FM 17-10 .)
76
ARMORED BATTALION,' LIGHT AND MEDIUM
33
a. The assembly position (area) should afford concealment
and is preferably beyond the range of hostile medium artillery
fire, usually about 8,000 to 9,000 yards from the line of
departure. If such assembly position would cause the battalion
to move through a defile to reach attack positions, then
select an assembly position in front of the defiles or cause
several passages to be constructed through the obstacle .
(See fig. 50 .) In assembly areas, post security, check vehicles
and weapons. Get everything ready for the attack .
b. An intermediate position may be designated if the assembly
position is a great distance from attack positions .
This is in fact a forward assembly position and should have
the same characteristics as the assembly position .
c. The attack position is as near the, line of departure as
practicable, considering concealment . There will be an attack
position for cach company or platoon . Halts are made
only long enough to regain control, for last minute coordination
with other troops, especially infantry if the attack is
made through or in conjunction with infantry . Before reaching
the attack position, assume a deployed or semideployed
formation . Take up the formation with which the line of
departure is to be -passed .
d., The rallying point is a well-defned terrain feature at
which the tanks assemble after reaching their objective . It is
usually in rear of (on the friendly side of) the fnal objective .
(See fig . 52 .) It should afford concealment and take advantage
of natural obstacles for security. Here the battalion
reorganizes, resupplies as necessary, takes care of wounded,
and prepares for further action. Alternate rallying points
are designated in case the rallying point is untenable or
cannot be attained. The attack position may be designated as
an alternate rallying point. There should be a rallying point
and an alternate rallying point for each objective . Do not
stop to reorganize on each objective . If the going is good
keep going to the final objective, then reorganize . Keep control
by observation of advance and issuance of necessary
coordinating orders .

â 34. MEETING ENGAGEMENT.--a . A meeting engagement may
occur when the situation is obscure, such as the meeting of
small hostile units when reconnaissance is not effective . Again
it may occur when opponents are aware of each other's presence
but attack immediately to gain some tactical advantage .
(See FM 17-10 .) Advance guard action is an example of a
meeting engagement .
b . In order to secure tactical advantage in a meeting
engagement it is essential that orders be issued and action
initiated immediately. Commanders must be well forward .
Little time is spent on coordination of fires . Attack is
usually launched from march column . The mission of the
command will determine the action taken .
c. The following shows one form of action in a meeting
engagement :
(1) Situation,-(a) Combat command A, 60th Armored
Division, is marching west along state highway 59 with the
mission of destroying an enemy unarmed column reported
advancing on TETRA from the west. (See fig, 53 .)
(b) The 1st Battalion, 99th Armored Regiment, with one
company of infantry, one platoon of engineers, a heavy tank
destroyer platoon, a medium tank company, and one battery
of field artillery attached forms the advance guard .
(c) Reports from combat command reconnaissance units
indicate a Red force of infantry, artillery, and tanks is marching
from the west on TETRA . This force has brushed aside
our reconnnaissance units .
(d) At 10 :00 AM the point of the advance guard is as
shown in figure 53 . The battalion reconnaissance platoon
has reached DEAD MAN CREEK and has just reported that
enemy patrol of two armored cars is moving east on highway
59, leading car about 500 yards west of DEAD MAN
CREEK.
(e) At this time the advance guard commander, who is
immediately behind the advance party, receives the following
message from the combat command commander :
""Battalion of enemy light tanks followed by two batteries
of artillery and a regiment of infantry is moving east on highway
59, head of column 2 miles east of TETRA. Seize
81
34
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
PERRY ROAD RIDGE at once and cover the development
of the combat command.""
(2) Actions and orders of battalion commander .-The
advance guard commander (battalion commander) immediately
gives orders as follows :
""Support commander, enemy tanks, artillery and infantry
moving east on highway 59, head of column 2 miles east of
TETRA. Move your company at maximum speed and cover
crossings of DEAD MAN CREEK .
""Artillery observer, I want artillery prepared to fire on
crossing of Dead Man Creek on highway 59 and enemy concentrations
in woods west of the creek .
""S-2-3 conduct reserve to assembly areas in woods west of
Lone Branch . Send assault gun platoon and mortar platoon
forward at once to report to me near junction of highway 59
and PERRY ROAD. Report to me at PERRY ROAD with
the company commanders . I am going forward .""
(3) Situation-continued .-(a) As the point crossed LONE
BRANCH it met the hostile reconnaissance cars previously
reported, quickly deployed, attacked, and destroyed the cars .
The advance guard continued the advance and as the point
approached the bridge over DEAD MAN CREEK it was fired
upon by two tanks coming down the road to the west . It
immediately moved off the road to the woods on the right .
The advance party took position on hill west of PERRY
ROAD together with the assault gun, opened fire, and
destroyed the hostile tanks . The support commander moved
the infantry platoon south of the road and a tank north
with orders to cover crossings of DEAD MAN CREEK . (See
fig. 54 .)
(b) The advance guard commander arrived at junction of
highway 59 and PERRY ROAD . He learned by radio report
from the reconnaissance platoon that DEAD MAN CREEK
was favorable for crossing by tanks to a distance of 1 mile
north of the bridge . One reconnaissance squad reconnoitering
to the south reported to the infantry platoon leader on
the south of the road that suitable tank crossings were located
200 and 400 yards south of the bridge, This was reported to
the battalion commander .
82
ARMORED BATTALION, LIGHT AND MEDIUM
34
(c) The reconnaissance platoon leader reported enemy
patrols on west bank of DEAD MAN CREEK and what was
estimated as a platoon of tanks moving into woods north of
the road. (See fig . 54 .) Just then hostile artillery fire fell
on woods northeast of the bridge knocking out one of the two
tanks at (1) . The S-2-3 and the company commanders
arrived at this time . An air observer dropped message stating
that hostile tanks, estimated as a battalion, were moving
north of road and going toward woods north of highway 59 .
Infantry in carriers was moving into woods south of roads .
(4) Actions and orders of battalion commander-continued.
""Artillery observer, bring fire on enemy tanks at (2) .
""Look at your maps . Tanks estimated as a battalion are
moving here (pointing to map) . Infantry is moving into
that woods (pointing to woods) .
""We hold this ridge to cover development of the combat
command. DEAD MAN CREEK is fordable north of that
bridge .
""Company B with assault gun and mortar attached, move
here (see map), Prepare to repel enemy attack from west
or north and to attack on my order .
""Company C. Position rear Company B . Protect, right
flank .
""Company D. Position south Company C. One platoon
edge woods cover west on north . (See map.)
""Infantry company, move south of road, cover crossings of
DEAD MAN CREEK there . 1st platoon Company A attached
to you.
""Mortar platoon less one squad cover bridge to front .
""Assault gun platoon less one gun cover bridge to front .
""I'll be with Company B .
""Move out.
""Artillery observer be prepared to switch fires to area in
front of Company B . Come with me .
""Company A keep enemy from crossing creek to your front,
If artillery fire is needed, call me . You may adjust the fire .""

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
2 35 . ATTACK BY PENETRATION-a . General.-(1) Armored
units seek to attack through weak spots in an enemy position,
break through, and destroy rear installation . Attack is
made through a well-organized position only when attack on
other points is impracticable .
(2) A penetration is characterized by attack on a narrow
front, the massing of all available fires, and the maximum
coordination of all means of attack . Often infantry and
engineers will attack first to clear paths through obstacles
through which tank units may pass .
(3) The attack is made in three echelons, Against a position
strong in antitank guns, medium tanks lead .
b. First echelon of attack,-(1) Action prior to the attack.-
Prior to the attack and after receiving the plan of
attack the battalion commander-
(a) Makes a map and personal reconnaissance of the routes
to the attack position and, from an observation post, studies
the ground over which he is to attack .
(b) Causes company commanders and as many as practicable
of lower unit commanders to make a personal reconnaissance
.
(c) Contacts infantry and reconnaissance units in the zone,
obtains all information they may have concerning the terrain
and the enemy, arranges for fire support and passage of lines .
If infantry and engineers attack first, he arranges for liaison .
(d) Obtains information on artillery support for the initial
attack and for subsequent action . Makes requests for additional
fires or changes in artillery fire plan if desired,
(e) Obtains information on air bombardment support .
Requests support desired . Makes arrangements for liaison
with air observation .
(f) Plans his attack.
(g) Issues his attack order .
(2) Plan of attack.-The plan of attack includes-
(a) Formation .-Consider width of zone and distance to
final objective . Normally the width will not exceed 1500
yards . A formation with two companies leading will usually
be satisfactory. The battalion commander prescribes the
initial formation for the companies or gives each company
a frontage .

(b) Objective .-Designate a series of objectives. The first
objective is usually the enemy second line position or a prominent
terrain feature in rear of his front installations . Objective
should be easily discernible terrain features .
(c) Direction of attack.-The objectives determine the direction
of attack. However, an azimuth of attack should be
given. If a change of direction becomes necessary, make it
on a prominent terrain feature .
(d) Boundaries .-Boundaries rarely are designated unless
another battalion is attacking abreast. The boundary is then
designated by the higher commander . Each company is given
a frontage . A road or other suitable feature may be designated
as a guide . A boundary may be given between companies
. However, designation of objectives will often be
sufficient . Figure 56 shows a boundary between companies .
(e) Line of departure .-This should be some line as far forward
as available cover will permit . It may be a small stream,
edge of a woods or other distinguishing line. Different lines
of departure may be designated for each company .
(f) Time of attack.This will normally be set by the higher
commander and is on time or by signal. When infantry
attacks prior to the tanks, the tank is launched by signal .
(3) Attack through infantry .-(a) If the attack is made
through infantry, special arrangements must be made for passage
of lines . The battalion commander contacts the infantry
commander in his zone and arranges for this passage . Each
company commander contacts the infantry troops in his part
of the zone and makes arrangements whereby foot troops indicate
their positions so they will not be endangered by tanks .
Guides are posted as necessary .
(b) When infantry attacks first to clear a passage through
obstacles, liaison is maintained by the battalion commander
with the infantry commander . Infantry or engineers post
guides to show tanks where to cross the obstacles .
(4) Movement to attack positions(a) Guides are posted
or routes marked to attack positions . The battalion moves
out, protected if necessary by a small covering detachment .
The covering platoon should be from the reserve company
and takes up positions to protect the attack position and

support the attack. The mortar platoon and assault gun
platoon follow the covering force and go into position . The
leading companies follow and move Into attack position . The
reserve and the battalion headquarters, less the command
group, move last. The battalion commander with his S-3
moves behind the covering force . The artillery observer eithermoves
with the battalion commander or goes to the attack
position ahead of the battalion where he will be ready to
observe and adjust fires.
(b) Movement to the attack position is made at such time
that only a few minutes will be spent in that position for last
minute check and orders .
(5) Conduct of the attack .-(a) The battalion commander
observes the attack and, by personal orders or by use of his
staff, directs the companies as necessary . The battalion
commander must use the radio himself .
(b) As the attack progresses, the battalion commander or
his S-3 designates targets or missions for the assault gun
platoon or the mortar platoon . The battalion commander
personally directs the movement of the reserve to influence
the action . He calls upon the artillery observer for fires . In
case the artillery observer becomes a casualty the battalion
commander or his officers adjust artillery fire . (See FM
17-62 .)
(c) The reserve follows the assault companies at 300 to
1,000 yards . It moves by bounds from cover to cover where
it can give continuous fire support to the leading companies
and protect the flanks . Do not use the reserve company for
artillery support when artillery is available, This will deplete
the ammunition supply and the reserve will not be able to
influence the action later . When an objective is taken the
reserve must be prepared to protect against counterattack .
(d) For action of rallying point see paragraph 33 .

mission of a depleted company .
c. Second echelon of attack .-(1) Position,-The second
echelon may be either light or medium tanks . It follows the
leading echelon at a variable distance from 500 to 3,000 yards,
depending upon the terrain and the enemy situation . It
should be close enough so that the enemy will not have time
to reorganize his antitank defense after the first echelon
passes but should not be so close as to become intermingled
with elements of the first echelon .
(2) Function .-The second echelon of attack must be prepared
to-
(a) Support the leading echelon by fire .
(b) Protect the flanks of the leading echelon .
(c) Pass through and assume the mission of the first
echelon should that battalion become so depleted as to be
unable to continue on its mission .
(d) Make an envelopment to either flank .
(3) Formation.The second echelon must assume a formation
that permits fire support of the leading echelon by

some of its elements ; covers the zone of attack to beat down
hostile automatic weapons ; and facilitates movement to
either flank or passage through the first echelon . Wedge
formation will be proper in most cases .
(4) Action prior to the attack.-Prior to the attack and
after receiving the orders or plan of the regimental or combat
command commander, the battalion commander-
(a) Makes personal reconnaissance and causes lower unit
commanders to reconnoiter routes to the attack position and
to the line of departure of the first echelon .
(b) Studies map of zone of attack .
(c) Contacts battalion commander of first echelon, learns
his plan of attack, marks objectives on map, locates artillery
check points, arranges to support first echelon by fire .
(d) Contacts infantry or reconnaissance units in the front,
obtains all possible information of the enemy, arranges for
be made through mine fields or other obstacles, and arranges
for indicating to tanks the location of these paths,
ments for indicating to tanks the location of these paths .
(e) Obtains information on artillery support .
(f) Plans his attack .
(5) Plan.-The plan includes the steps outlined in b(2)
above .
(6) Conduct of the attack .-(a) The battalion moves into
position immediately after the first echelon of attack . The
battalion commander must be well forward, usually just behind
the company supporting the first echelon . He moves the
battalion forward when the first echelon has passed the first
obstacles or when his support company can no longer support
the leading echelon by fire .
(b) The battalion commander moves his battalion rapidly
forward and overruns and destroys hostile infantry and
weapons. He must be ready at all times to repel a counterattack
from either flank. He overcomes small isolated enemy
resistance by use of tanks, mortars, and artillery fire . During
the advance, the artillery may displace forward with or
behind his battalion . This artillery is not attached to his
battalion but he gives such aid and security as is consistent
with accomplishment of his mission .
(c) In case of enemy counterattack the battalion commander
immediately takes appropriate countermeasures,

d, Third echelon of attack .-(1) If armored infantry makes
the initial attack, the tank battalion will advance behind the
second echelon of attack, joining the infantry in front of the
line of departure . If the armored infantry does not make
the initial attack, it advances, in carriers, close behind the
second echelon of attack. The tank battalion follows the
Infantry closely . (See (3) below.)
(2) Prior to the attack the battalion commander-
(a) Makes a map and personal reconnaissance and requires
subordinate leader to make such reconnaissance as is practicable
.
(b) Contacts the infantry commander and makes arrangements
for coordination, and liaison .
(c) Plans his action .
(3) The advance to attack maybe made with infantry leading,
with tanks leading, or by tanks and infantry together .
(a) When resistance is light, infantry in carriers will
usually lead the attack. The leading tanks follow the infantry
at 200 to 500 yards . When infantry is forced off carriers by
hostile fire, tanks immediately attack and assist the infantry
to advance .
(b)' When the second echelon has not reduced all hostile
automatic weapons the tanks of the third echelon lead the
attack. Infantry follows closely in carriers if practicable .
(c) When attacking, dismounted infantry advances with or
closely behind the tanks .
(4) The tanks of the third echelon must be prepared to-
(a) Overcome local resistance holding up the infantry .
(b) Repel a counterattack .
(c) Move rapidly to either flank as an enveloping force to
assist the first or second echelon .
(d) Pursue .
â 36 . ENVELOPMENT .-The battalion may be used as an enveloping
force and may itself use enveloping action in attack .
a. Battalion as an enveloping force .-As an enveloping
force the battalion will usually be reinforced. It moves
rapidly around the enemy flanks and attacks from flank or
rear. The attack is timed with a frontal attack by infantry
or other tanks and with artillery fire . The objective and time
of attack is set by the higher commander, Time of attack

may be upon signal that the enveloping battalion is in position
. When practicable the battalion commander will be
permitted to choose his own direction of attack, the flank only
being indicated .
(1) In an envelopment, place mortars, assault guns, and a
medium tank company to support the attack by fire . Use the
remainder of the battalion as a maneuvering force .
(2) In advancing to attack positions, use a covering force
consisting of the reconnaissance platoon, one or more platoons
of tanks, and infantry .
(3) Use the reconnaissance platoon to reconnoiter the
exposed flank and protect this exposed flank by a tank platoon
. The infantry company follows the attack at about 500
yards, in carriers as far as possible, and mops up the enemy
position .

â 37. TANK VERSUS TANx ACTION (see FM 17-10) .-Attacking
tanks frequently encounter hostile tank units unexpectedly .
At other times they may be required to attack hostile tanks
deliberately in order to break up an attack or a counterattack .
It is therefore necessary that all personnel be carefully trained
in recognition of hostile and friendly tanks ; characteristics
and capabilities of hostile tanks as to armor, armament, and
speed ; vulnerable parts of hostile tanks upon which fire will
be effective ; range at which each of our weapons is effective
against hostile vehicles ; enemy methods of tank employment ;
and methods of combating hostile tanks, such as the use of
speed, defilade and cover, and ambush . In tank versus tank
actiona.
Use artillery concentrations on hostile tanks . Concentrations
will be especially effective in defiles.
b. Place some tanks (preferably medium tanks) together
with assault guns in def laded or concealed positions to fire
upon and slow down the hostile attack when enemy tanks
come within effective range.
c. Use mortars to place smoke on the enemy to disorganize
his attack. Smoke may also be used to screen maneuver of
your own tanks .
d. Maneuver part of the battalion to one or both hostile
flanks where they can attack by fire at close range, preferably
from defiladed or ccncealed position.
e . If defiladed or concealed positions are not available use
smoke both of mortars and artillery to disorganize the enemy
and screen the advance to effective range .
/. When attacking, an enemy inferior in armament, advance
rapidly to positions beyond the effective range of his weapons,
take up stationary position, and fire . If enemy advances,
withdraw and keep beyond range of his guns while still keeping
him within effective range of your own guns .
g. When attacked by an enemy whose armament is superior
to your own, withdraw and lead him into your own antitank
defenses . If there are no ant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to commitment to a definite line of action they are
held mobile prepared to participate in battle in accordance
with the plan of maneuver of the superior commander While
so held they are disposed for all around defense against
attack by hostile mechanized forces which may succeed in
passing through or around the battle position Necessary
measures are taken for' protection against hostile aircraft
and for countering an attack by troops transported by air
ORGANIZATION OF FIRE
627 Coordination of the fire of the infantry artillery
antitank antiaircraft and other weapons is carefully planned
and expressed in orders Plans provide for bringing the
enemy under effective fire as early as practicable unless the
situation requires that fire be withheld to obtain surprise
and for so regulating the intensity of the fire that the enemy
is subjected to progressively heavier fire as he approaches
the defensive position
628 The organization of systematic flanking fire by machine
guns supplemented by other small arms constitutes the
basis of defensive dispositions Adjacent units in addition to
defending their own fronts mutually cover one another's
fronts with flanking fire Dead spaces in bands of machinegun
fire are covered by the fire of other weapons Fire effect
45
628-630
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
is increased by obstacles which hold the enemy under frontal
and flanking fire Sectors of the defensive position especially
exposed to hostile fire may be left unoccupied except at night
and during periods of low visibility and defended by flanking
fire from adjacent sectors
Machine guns are distributed in width and depth in each
battalion defensive area to take full advantage of terrain
As far as practicable their fire should cover the entire front
of the main line of resistance with continuous bands of fire
Some machine guns are sited to take under flanking fire
hostile elements which succeed in penetrating the main line
of resistance Some of the heavy machine guns are located
where they can develop long range fire during the hostile approach
without disclosing the location of the main line of
resistance
Artillery fire is coordinated in the defensive plan of fire and
is especially concentrated on the critical localities and on
ground which is dead to or beyond the range of the fire of
other supporting weapons The effective control of this fire
requires good observation and efficient signal communication
0 629 All possible measures are taken to insure security
against mechanized attack Antimechanized defense is organized
throughout the depth of the position The main effort
is made in areas which are favorable to the employment of
mechanized forces Battalion and regimental antitank guns
from concealed positions defend the forward part of the
battle position while antitank weapons of higher units are
echeloned farther in rear Positions and routes for these
weapons are reconnoitered and the guns are held in readiness
prepared for rapid movement to any threatened part of the
front (See also ch 6 and sec V ch 0 )
Through a judicious combination of antitank weapons and
obstacles aided by artillery fire combat aviation and tanks
attacks by mechanized forces are broken up and halted as
soon as they are disclosed
2 630 The division artillery commander prepares the general
plans for the employment of artillery in accordance with instructions
of the division commander Coordination between
artillery fires and those of other weapons is essential It is
effected principally through liaison between artillery units
and the units they are designated to support The close sup-

47
port of the main line of resistance is a governing consideration
in the formulation of all artillery plans
â¢ 63 The artillery plan of fire is based primarily upon the
execution of a counterpreparation to break up or cripple the
hostile attack before it can be launched Fire is not opened
by the mass of the artillery until targets of sufficient importance
are disclosed
It is important to take hostile artillery under fire at an
early moment to interdict hostile routes of approach and to
dislocate the hostile system of command and fire control
The artillery of the attacker is most vulnerable from the
moment it comes within range of the defender's artillery
until it has completed its deployment During this period it
constitutes one of the principal targets of the defender's
artillery fire and aviation The fire of all available artillery
is concentrated to cripple the hostile artillery before it can
get into action Counterbattery continues to be the principal
mission of a portion of the artillery especially the medium
artillery throughout the battle
The corps gives the division instructions regulating the
employment of the division artillery in the execution of its
more distant missions The corps reinforces the action of
the division artillery and extends its sector of fire in depth by
the use of the artillery at its disposal Long-range destruction
and interdiction fire is directed especially on sensitive
points in the enemy's rear areas and on his lines of communication
(bridges crossroads and supply establishments)
â¢ 632 Combat aviation extends in depth and reinforces the
fire of the artillery Air attack against hostile ammunition
and other supply establishments airdromes railroad installations
and bridges have important effects in delaying or dislocating
the hostile preparations for attack Other remunerative
targets for combat aviation are enemy columns artillery
in position reserves and mechanized forces
â¢
633 Antiaircraft artillery is disposed initially to protect
the organization and occupation of the battle position
When the commander has determined on what front the
enemy is making his main attack the antiaircraft artillery
concentrates its efforts cn preventing air observation and
attack on the threatened parts of the defensive position and
on protecting the employment of reserves for counterattack
633-635
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
If sufficient antiaircraft 'artillery is available some units
are assigned to the defense of important roads and installations
(railheads ammunition establishments and airdromes)
The antiaircraft intelligence service gives prompt warning of
the approach of hostile aircraft to all units concerned (See
par 67 )
Antiaircraft artillery weapons are sited so they may be
employed against attack by mechanized vehicles when this
can be done without interference with their normal missions
In the event of simultaneous attack from hostile aircraft and
mechanized vehicles fire must be concentrated against the
more dangerous threat
ORGANIZATION OF THE GROUND
634 The organization of a position is limited only by the
time and facilities available Protection is to be sought in
the distribution of defenses In depth and in width their
adaptation to the terrain concealment from hostile observation
and in the strength of construction From the beginning
great care Is taken to conceal the most important works by
camouflage or natural terrain features Measures for increasing
the effect of fire and for providing adequate signal communication
take precedence over the construction of field
fortification
â 635 Troops carry out the organization of the position
in accordance with a plan of construction expressed in orders
in the form of priorities After the location of combat emplacements
has been fixed priority is given to clearing the
field of fire to removal of objects masking our own observation
and to the determination of ranges to points In the foreground
Primary consideration should be given to provisions
for camouflaging the works to be constructed These measures
are followed ordinarily by the construction of the various
defensive works and obstacles and by the preparation of
routes of approach for reserves and for ammunition supply
Work may proceed simultaneously on several items
Artillery and heavy weapons units give priority 'to the construction
of observation and command posts and signal communication
systems and provision for the supply of ammunition
Shelter is constructed for personnel and provision is
made for camouflage of ammunition dumps and the protec-
48
OPERATIONS
635-640
tion of ammunition against the weather For the protection
of guns more reliance is placed upon camouflage and provision
for alternate positions than upon the fortification of
gun emplacements
â¢ 636 In the construction of obstacles wire entanglements
are sited so that their outer edges can be swept by flanking
fire Other obstacles are coordinated with demolitions All
obstacles are covered by fire to hinder their removal They
should be concealed from hostile observation
â¢ 637 Dummy works serve to mislead the enemy and disperse
his fire To be effective they must closely resemble
genuine works ; dummy works easily recognizable as such give
the enemy valuable negative information They must bear
evidence of an attempt at camouflage
â¢ 638 Channels of signal communication are increased and
alternate channels provided Units are connected by wire
lines not only with the rear but also laterally ; the importance
of lateral lines consists not only in affording direct signal
communication between adjacent units but also in making
available numerous alternative channels of signal communication
between advanced units and the rear Alternate
command posts are selected and organized
â¢ 639 Engineers are employed to impede the advance of the
enemy by the execution of demolitions and by the creation
of a zone of obstacles including mine fields When necessary
they defend the demolitions and obstacles which they
construct They increase the defensive powers of the other
arms by the construction of field works requiring special equipment
or training by technical assistance in other works of
organization of the ground and by furnishing them with
the necessary tools and engineer supplies
They may also be employed in the siting or preparation of
rear positions In emergencies they may participate in the
defense as Infantry
â¢ 640 The activities of the chemical troops and engineers
are closely coordinated Persistent chemicals if to be used
have especial defensive value by reason of the fact that concentrations
established before the hostile attack retain their
effectiveness during the course of the attack Barriers of
persistent chemicals are placed to protect portions of the
49
640-643
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
front and flanks of the position and to cover defiles vital
roads road junctions and wooded stream lines across or along
favorable routes of hostile approach When these barriers
qan be placed without hostile interference persistent chemical
mines are employed ; when the area is controlled by the
enemy aviation artillery or chemical mortars are used In
deciding to use persistent chemicals the commander must
carefully evaluate its effect on his contemplated future operations
â¢ 64 The selection of a rear position at such distance from
the'main position that the attacker cannot direct the fire
of his artillery upon it without displacing his batteries facilitates
the conduct of a flexible defense The extent of its organization
will depend upon the situation and the time available
The forces employed in the construction of the rear
position must not be obtained at the risk of jeopardizing the
defense of the main battle position
â¢ 642 The development of a hastily occupied defensive position
into a more strongly fortified defensive system is dependent
upon the situation and the time and material available
for construction This may take place on a front which
has stabilized after an indecisive battle or is out of contact
with the enemy
â¢ 643 The development of such a defensive position aims
first of all to strengthen the main line of resistance battery
positions and the command and control facilities of the
entire position The means employed include numerous
communication trenches; obstacles including tank barriers
and mines; shelter for troops ; observation and command
posts including alternate locations ; signal communication ;
gun positions ; and supply dumps These works differ from
those in mobile situations in the elaborateness and permanency
of their construction In areas of resistance in rear
of the main line of resistance permanent works are constructed
to limit hostile penetration All works are concealed
or camouflaged
In the siting of emplacements for defending troops extreme
care must be taken that there are no undefended
approaches from any direction that would permit hostile
elements to work their way in close enough to destroy the
occupants with hand grenades or other close-combat weap-
50
OPERATIONS
643-648
ons Provision must be made for protecting the rear against
attack by troops transported by air and by highly mobile
forces
â 644 Communication trenches greatly facilitate the exercise
of command the movement of troops and the functioning
of supply In moving situations time will rarely be available
for the complete construction and camouflage of such
trenches They are indispensable in the prolonged occupation
of a position They are first constructed over exposed
stretches on the routes of approach from the rear ; their
entrances are conspicuously marked As a general rule communication
trenches should not be employed as combat
emplacements They should be so sited that they will not
indicate to the enemy the location of combat emplacements
Their use however as part of a switch position in case
the main line of resistance becomes untenable should be'
considered
5 645 The nature of overhead cover varies with the location
of the troops to be sheltered The only forms of protection
having permanent value against fire are dugouts and concrete
or steel shelters sufficiently resistant to withstand highpowered
artillery fire and bombs from the air Deep dugouts
in the front lines do not permit the prompt egress of troops
and in case of attack may become traps Overhead cover for
front-line troops is designed chiefly to afford splinter-proof
protection and shelter from the weather Lack of strength is
compensated for as far as possible by the increased number
and smaller size of the shelters
â¢ 646 Overhead cover is an essential means of conserving the
fighting capacity of the troops in the prolonged occupation
of a position
Reserves within range of hostile artillery fire and subject to
the attack of combat aviation are as far as practicable
sheltered in bombproof dugouts
â¢ 647 In a stabilized situation the problem of drainage assumes
great importance ; the siting of works with a view to
effective drainage is always given due consideration
â¢ 648 In addition to the depots of large units small dumps
of ammunition rations and materials needed in the construction
and defense of the position are established in the sectors
of small units
5
649-652
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â¢ 649 The priority of work in the development of a position
which is out of contact with the enemy is determined
largely by the time required for the construction of the essential
works and the extent to which they lend themselves to
camouflage Provision must be made for camouflage before
the work is begun Camouflage is then carried on continuously
throughout the work
After reconnaissance and determination of the method of
occupation of the position command posts observation posts
signal communication facilities obstacles and shelters for
the troops are constructed Adequate forces must be concentrated
early on important works requiring a considerable
period for their construction To avoid disclosing the position
the construction of fire and communication trenches
may be deferred until troops occupy the position
SECTION II
CONDUCT OF THE DEFENSE
â¢ 650 The defense is conducted along mobile lines Mobility
is obtained by the use of covering forces by improving facilities
for movement within the battle position by distribution
of forces in depth and by holding out reserves capable
of rapid movement Covering forces delay deceive and disorganize
the enemy ; units in organized areas of the battle
position hold their positions at all costs ; reserves maneuver
behind the pivots thus established Mobile and rigid defense
are so combined that possession is retained of the areas
essential to the maneuver of the defensive forces the maximum
forces are made available for counterattack or counteroffensive
purposes and the enemy is deceived as to the
character of the resistance with which he is confronted
â¢ 65 The conduct of the defense must be aggressive It
must be prepared to take advantage of errors or failures on
the part of the enemy The counterattack is the decisive element
of defensive action It is seldom feasible to hold a defensive
position by passive resistance only
652 The integrity of the battle position is maintained by a
combination of fighting in place and counterattack
Regardless of the considerations which dictated the adoption
of a defensive attitude the tactics of defensive combat are
essentially to develop the maximum firepower against an
52
OPERATIONS
652-656
advancing enemy to reduce our own losses by a better knowledge
and utilization of the terrain and thereby to stop the
enemy's advance or throw him back by counterattack
653 In order to maintain itself in action in the face of
hostile superiority the artillery must fully exploit its mobility
If there are indications that the location of certain
batteries has been discovered such batteries effect a change
to one of their alternative or supplementary positions
In quiet periods artillery units assigned to counterbattery
and harassing missions may be moved to previously surveyed
positions for the delivery of fire This movement occupation
of position delivery of fire and return to position are generally
accomplished during hours of darkness
â¢ 654 When the imminence of the hostile attack is discovered
counterpreparation fires are directed upon the hostile
attack formations artillery and command observation and
signal communication systems to break up the attack before
it starts A general counterpreparation involving all of the
artillery with the command is fired on the order of the superior
commander Local counterpreparations designed to
cover only the points threatened by a local attack are fired
on the order of subordinate commanders
â¢ 655 If the enemy succeeds in launching his attack in spite
of the counterpreparation the artillery seeks to keep him
under fire in considerable depth by placing defensive concentrations
on his advancing attack echelons and on his reserves
and by continuing counterbattery fire These fires are delivered
on the request of supported unit commanders or
of observers following the progress of the attack with air
or ground observation
â¢ 656 Finally defensive concentrations and barrages are
fired close to our troops They strengthen the fire of other
weapons covering the most dangerous avenues of approach
to the positions Barrages generally are delivered on pyrotechnic
signal from the front-line troops but may be executed
on report from artillery observers that the hostile attack
is threatening the integrity of the position
Since a uniform distribution of artillery fire along the entire
front is generally ineffective plans for the delivery of concentrations
and barrages are designed to provide fire on
53
656-660
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
critical areas or fronts These fires especially the barrages
are delivered at a high rate and involve a great expenditure
of ammunition Hence it is essential that front-line units
carefully consider the emergency in their calls for artillery
support
Provision should be made for reinforcing counterpreparation
and barrage fires by artillery normally assigned to other
missions or by the artillery of adjacent divisions
â¢ 657 In addition to the artillery other supporting weapons
participate in counterpreparation and barrage fires Their
fires are coordinated with those of the artillery in the plan
of defense
â¢ 658 Infantry defends its position by employing all the
weapons at its disposal in cooperation with artillery fires
supported by combat aviation both pursuit and bombardment
As the enemy comes within range the infantry heavy
weapons including those of units in reserve are brought into
action
â¢ 659 A unit intrusted with the defense of a tactical locality
under no circumstances abandons it unless authorized to do
so by higher authority Important localities on the main line
of resistance must be defended to the last man Local commanders
take the necessary steps to maintain their positions
rectifying gaps in their dispositions or fires by the use of
their supports Plans are made for the employment of local
reserves As the area of their probable employment becomes
apparent reserves are moved to be more readily available
for action
A 660 When the front and direction of the main hostile
attack have been determined the defense takes final steps to
meet it Combat aviation attacks those hostile elements
which constitute the greatest threat to the defense Artillery
and other supporting weapons deliver fires on the attacking
infantry As the hostile attacking elements come within effective
small-arms range and are unmasked by the withdrawing
outposts the defending force increases its fire with
all available weapons Threatened sectors not fully garrisoned
are occupied Chemical troops from positions well forward
supplement the fires of artillery and other supporting
weapons with fires on avenues of approach and on known or
probable areas occupied by the attacking troops The bulk
54
OPERATIONS
660-669
of the available reserves are held mobile prepared for aggressive
action
As the enemy attack draws closer machine guns switch
their fires to their final protective lines ; all weapons participate
in the fire fight until finally the enemy is stopped or
driven back
m 66 Reconnaissance is conducted and plans are prepared
for the employment of reserves based on the probable lines
of action which may develop during combat Reserves must
be prepared to occupy a previously reconnoitered defensive
area to check a hostile penetration or an envelopment of the
position or to deliver a counterattack for the purpose of
maintaining or restoring the main defensive position Reserves
are committed to the position only to the extent necessary
to stabilize the situation and establish a firm base from
which to launch a counterattack Motor transportation is
used to increase the mobility of reserves
â¢ 662 Tanks are essentially offensive weapons They are
held in reserve in a covered position out of effective artillery
range until the situation is favorable for their employment
They constitute a powerful reserve in the hands of the commander
either to engage hostile tanks or to support a general
counterattack or counteroffensive
â¢ 663 Should the enemy succeed in penetrating or outflanking
the position the defender seeks through fire and maneuver
to eject the hostile elements which have so advanced
The fire of the supporting artillery is concentrated on the
hostile elements which have entered the position Local reserves
supported by all available weapons and protected by
smoke from chemical mortars counterattack against the
flanks of the gap to thrust back the enemy before he has had
time to establish himself Such local counterattacks must
be launched during the period of temporary confusion and
disorganization which occurs when the attacking troops have
entered the position and have not had time to reorganize and
establish themselves This period is relatively short Consequently
the counterattack must be delivered without delay
on the initiative of the local commander The object of such
counterattack is to stabilize the situation on that particular
part of the position and prevent widening of the gap or
in case of a small penetration to eject the enemy Surprise

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
boldness and rapidity are the principal factors which lead
to successful execution Anticipatory planning to include
reconnaissance will facilitate greatly the prompt delivery of
the counterattack If the enemy is given time to reorganize
and to place his machine guns and antitank guns in position
to defend the ground he has gained the opportunity to counterattack
by local reserves probably has passed Then only
a well-prepared counterattack by larger reserves strongly
supported by combat aviation has much chance of success
i 664 Should the enemy succeed in penetrating through the
position with a strong mechanized attack it is essential that
units on the battle position close the gap thus created without
delay and before succeeding hostile units can exploit the
success attained The shoulders of the salient must be held
at all costs Local commanders must react promptly and on
their own initiative rectify the situation
E 665 If the enemy has attained such success that local commanders
are unable to eject him the higher commander must
decide whether to counterattack with reserves at his disposal
to restore the battle position to continue battle on the battle
position and prevent further enemy advance or to withdraw
to a prepared position in rear
Time is required for the preparation of a major counterattack
Sufficient reserves must be assembled to carry the
attack forward Adequate fire support must be arranged Assembly
positions zones of action objectives and time of attack
are clearly specified Surprise is an important factor Employment
of artillery chemical troops mechanized units and
combat aviation is regulated and controlled by the higher commander
Whenever practicable the counterattack Is launched
against the flanks of the hostile salient Advance planning
for such an operation Is essential in order to reduce to a minimum
the time required in final preparation
In reaching a decision to withdraw to a rearward position
the commander must carefully evaluate the time required to
reach and organize such a position and the effect of hostile
mechanized and air attacks on his withdrawing forces The

serves of higher commanders are suitably employed on such
rearward positions To order a withdrawal to an unorganized
and unoccupied rear position in the face of attacks by mechanized
forces and combat aviation invites disaster for the
entire command
A 666 When the battle is interrupted by nightfall combat
outposts are established by front-line battalions (See par
678 ) Provision is made for patrolling and illuminating the
foreground and the intervals between defense areas Frontline
garrisons may be reinforced Machine guns are laid for
their final protective fires Provision is made to place the
defensive fires of artillery and other supporting weapons in
front of the combat outposts These fires cover those areas
that cannot be reached by rifle and machine-gun fire and
should be prepared while there is still some daylight They
are delivered on prearranged signals from the combat outposts
â 667 When the enemy succeeds in establishing himself on
favorable ground at close range from the main line of resistance
it may be advisable to redistribute the defending
forces in depth In such case the main line of resistance may
be shifted to the rear of the zone of resistance and the original
maih line of resistance held by combat outposts ; or the defense
may be transferred to a rear position in which case the
preparations for a withdrawal from action and a renewal
of the defense on the new position must be made in advance
(See ch ) Withdrawal to a rear position is as a rule advisable
only when the situation clearly shows that the first
position is untenable or will soon become untenable
0 668 When a stabilization of operations gradually develops
the decision must be made whether to push an outpost forward
and continue to hold the present position making the
necessary rectifications ; or to hold the old position as an
outpost position and transfer the principal forces to a rear
position (see par 64 ) which then becomes the main battle
position In either case a redistribution of forces is necessary
Measures are taken for the development and strengthening
of the new defensive position Obstacles are reinforced additional
mine fields are constructed defense against chemicals
is more thoroughly organized shelter is provided for
men and ammunition and measures are taken to provide for
the rest and comfort of troops

â¢ 669 Where a stabilized situation develops or a defense
continues for a prolonged period the necessity for conservation
of the fighting power of the troops requires provision
for the periodic relief of units in line For the sake of continuity
in the execution of the plan of defense it is as a general
rule advantageous to avoid relieving the artillery and the
infantry at the same time
The relief is preceded by a detailed reconnaissance of the
sector by officers of the relieving unit If time permits all
commanders down to and including platoon leaders should
visit the position prior to the relief Commanders familiarize
themselves not only with the disposition of the defending
force but with the known hostile dispositions on their part
of the front Arrangements are completed for the transfer
of supplies and special equipment to be left on the position
by the unit relieved Sufficient guides are detailed from the
unit to be relieved to meet each infantry platoon or similar

classified as a withdrawal from action a delaying action or aretirement 697 Retrograde movements are made to accomplish one ormore of the following purposes :a To disengage from battleb To avoid battle in a disadvantageous situationc To draw the enemy into a situation unfavorable to himd To gain time without fighting a decisive engagemente To conform to the movement of other troopsf To permit the employment of a portion of the commandelsewhere 698 Retrograde movements in the face of the enemy aredifficult maneuvers and require constant control and supervision by all leaders Mechanized forces and combat aviation have increased the difficulties in executing these maneuvers and the necessity of organizing and occupying rear positions prior to the retrograde movement(See par 665 )Prompt reorganization of units careful attention to the feeding and care of the men and the presence of higher commanders well forward will tend to counteract the detrimental effects of this type of action 699 Demolitionsobstructions and contaminations areused to the maximum in all retrograde movements in orderto delay hostile pursuit to assist in flank protection and todestroy materials and

hostile force The general purpose of theoperation is to regain or preserve freedom of action0 707 The commander who orders a withdrawal designatesa rearward position on which the troops will prepare for arenewal of resistance or under the protection of which thetroops may be assembled for further retrograde movementThe rearward position is selected at such distance that theenemy will be compelled to regroup his forces displace hisartillery and renew his preparations for attack The commander usually determines the location of the position fromthe map He then issues the necessary orders for reconnaissance of the position and routes theretoThe commander makes special provision for holding theroad centers that control the lines of communication to therear and the features of the terrain that afford extendedobservation over the areas in rear of the battle front708 In a daylight withdrawal in addition to the rearwardposition the commander selects a suitable covering positionand details from any available reserves a mobile coveringforce strong in fire power to occupy it and cover the withdrawal of the troops engagedArtillery engineers antiaircraft automatic weapons antitank weapons and chemicaltroops are attached to the covering force 704 A daylight withdrawal usually involves such heavy 709 The mission of the covering force is to stop restrictlosses and so great a degree of disorganization that it ispreferable for large units to hold out at all costs until nightfall and effect the withdrawal under the cover of darknessAs a rule only rearward echelons can be withdrawn

successful accomplishment of this mission depends largely on the composition and location of the coveringforce and on the efficient execution of a systematic plan ofartillery and machine-gun defensive fires Often the missioncan be best accomplished by counterattackA 702 A hostile force strong in mechanized and motorizedunits and combat aviation may be expected to follow up orto pursue any retrograde movement relentlessly both by dayand by night(See also par 665 ) This necessitates continuous ground and aerial reconnaissance to both flanks andrear rapid movement under cover of darkness

orders to do so a decision to retireis Justified only when all possibilities of accomplishing theassigned mission have been exhausted and a continuationof the battle will lead either to excessive losses or to a decisivedefeatNo commander is authorized to order a retirement on hisown initiative simply because of local misfortune or reversessuffered by an adjacent unit 727 In retirements following a withdrawal the most important considerations for a commander are to place distance obstacles and a rear guard between his main body andthe enemy and to regain his freedom of actionTrains

to hold in position until the movement of the othersis well under way A restricted road net or defiles in the zoneof movement may necessitate withdrawals of fractions successively If a flank is

S .P. HEAVY FIELD HOWITZER-""Bumblebee""
Gw. III /IV (Hummel) fur 15 cm s.F.H. 18/1 (Sd. Kfz. 165)
This equipment, known as the ""Bumble Bee,"" is composed of
the 15 cm heavy field howitzer mounted on a modified Pz. Kw. IV
tank chassis. It should not be confused with the 10.5 cm l .F.H.
18/2 (""Wasp""), which is the 10 .5 cm light field howitzer mounted
on the chassis of a Pz. Kw. II tank. The road performance of the
""Bee"" will approximate that of the Pz. Kw. IV tank.
In the construction of this vehicle the following modifications
were made to the hull of the .Pz. Kw. N tank. The turret top plate
mounting the turret traversing ring, the front vertical plate, and
the rear partition separating the engine from the fighting compartment
have been removed . The engine, cooling-fan assembly
and exhaust pipes have been moved forward up to the gear box.
A partition has been built across the width of the hull dividing the
driver and assistant driver from the fighting compartment . A
steel plate separates the engine from the fighting compartment .
In place of the driver's entrance hatches a cover similar to a
cupola, with lid and shutter type vision, is provided.
The superstructure is in the form of a sloping four-sided shield
10 mm (.39 inch) thick. The front of the shield provides a bulging
slot for the traverse and elevation of the gun while the rear plate
is fitted with a hinged door .
The gun is mounted well back on the top of the engine cover
plate by means of angle iron and steel brackets so that its muzzle
projects almost flush with the nose of the hull . It retains its original
buffer, recuperator and compensator, and elevating and traversing
gears. Its overall length including muzzle brake, with which it
must be fitted when firing charge 8, is 17 feet, 4 1/4 inches. The
muzzle velocities of this piece are : Charge 6, 1,020 f. S. ; Charge 7,
1,375 f . s.; Charge 8, 1,965 f. s. The maximum ranges are : Charge
6, 10,550 yards; Charge 7, 12,140 yards; Charge 8, 14,380 yards.
Its elevation is 0Â°-39Â° ; traverse each side 16Â° .

HALF-TRACK PERSONNEL CARRIERS
Depsite the fact that the Germans have many models of half-track
(more properly three-quarter track) vehicles and have made wide use
of them, the latest battlefield reports contain high praise for the
American half-track as an all-around vehicle . This is no doubt due
to the great reliability engineered into this vehicle . Earlier in
the war our half-track was used as a self-propelled mount for Cal .
.50, 37mm, 75mm, and 105mm weapons, but this use has now been taken
over by fulltrack vehicles for all expect the Multiple Cal . .50
Gun Motor Carriage .
The German-half-track personnel carriers range in weight from
5 to 7.7 tons when armored and from 3 .7 tons through 16 .8 tons when
unarmored. These vehicles are also used as self-propelled mounts and
also as prime movers .
The German half-tracks are well engineered, making maxim:= use
of interchangeability of components among sizes and with other types
of combat vehicles . The longer track gives them better flotation on
soft ground but the American running gear is less complicated and
better adapted for long-range operations . Because of the many
varieties of German three-quarter tracks, only a selected number are
illustrated .
The Japanese have only recently used any kind of half-track,
and no technical data are yet available .
BATTIE FIELD REPORTS ON HALF TRACK PERSONNEL CARRIERS
""The American half-track manufactured by Aut-Car, Diamond T, White,
and International Harvester Companies, are no doubt the best vehicles of
their type in the world, but if several of the features found in the
simiiLr German vehicle were incorporated in our half-tracks they would
be even better than they are .
""The advantage of the Q.S. tracks in maintenance is much greater in
that the engines, chassis, tracks, and suspensions are interchangeable .
This is not possible with the many models of the Gennans . The U .S.
track has more speed and power, making it a better road vehicle, and
more maneuverable in cross-country use ."" (Comment of Lt . Col. R.N. dens,
Commanding 41st Armored Inf ., Regt .)
MEDIUM ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER
m. gp. Mannsch. Kw. (Sd. Kfz. 251)
GERMAN O
This vehicle is a medium armored personnel carrier with the
chassis of the Sd. Kfz. 11 (light semitracked prime mover) . The
Sd. Kfz. 11 has been modified by placing armor on the chassis,
a,~tering the cooling arrangement, and mounting the steering wheel
in- an inverted position. The armor plate thickness measures
7.5 mmF on the radiator cover, 8 .5 mm on the sides, and 15 mm on
the lower front plate, set at angles to the horizontal of 81Â° . 55-60Â°,
and 55Â° respectively . It has been reported that these vehicles
were used by the motorized infantry of armored divisions . Eight
variations are known to exist with designations 251/1 through
251/8. The vehicles are used for infantry, ammunition and- as
command vehicles with built-in wireless, or ambulances .
The suspension is the same as that utilized for the Sd . Kfz . 11,
as is also the power plant and the power train .
The armament normally consists . of two 7.92 mm M.G. 34's,
one on a mount welded to the front of the chassis and one on, an
antiaircraft pedestal mount in the rear of the vehicle . Reports have
been received that the 2 cm Kw .K. 30 is also mounted. The vehicle
has a seating capacity for eleven men, including the driver .

ARWRED CARS
Armored cars are designed for highway and favorable crosscountry
reconnaissance . They cannot travel on the unfavorable
terrain negotiable by tracked vehicles, but since they are completely
wheeled, their running gear has much longer life. Armored
cars are by design much more lightly armored than tanks .
The German and C. 8. models are fairly similar in appearance .
The U. S . types have six wheels, whereas the Germans use four, six,
and eight .
The U. 3 . troops have been provided with the Armored Car, iB,
throughout this war . The Armored Utility Car, 920, serves as an
accompanying vehicle . The Armored Car, lid, mounts a 37am Gun .
The Germans have a variety of armored cars, most modern of
which weigh 8-1/2 and 11-1/2 tons . The 8-l/2 ton car mounts a
single 20 gun and a heavy machine gun, whereas the 11-1/2-ton
car mounts a 50mm tank Gun KWg 39 with a muzzle vet -ty of 2,700
feet per second . The Germans also have mounted a 75mm low-velocity
gun on the eight-wheeled armored car .
No Japanese armored cars have been encountered in action since
the Solomon Islands campaign . The only models for which technical
data are available are of the obsolete type used to carry money and
securities in this country before the war .
6-WHEELED ARMORED CARS
s. Pz. Sp. Wg. (Sd. Kfz. 231, 232, 263)
This six-wheeled armored car is a heavy, highly mobile vehicle
with a four-man crew . It is armed with one 20 mm KwK 30
and one M. G . 34 coaxially mounted in the turret .
Like the 8 Rad Panzerspahwagen, the six-wheeled vehicle
can be operated from either the front or rear, duplicate controls
.being fitted at either end . Steering is by front wheels only. It
has a six-wheeled final drive ; single wheels at the front, and dual
double wheels at the rear . The front springs are fitted to the
frame with shock absorbers. The rear springs are suspended by
tubular traverse, semi-elliptical springs. It has six forward and
six reverse speeds.
Special gripper chains are available for fitting over the rear
wheels, thus giving each pair the function of a track . Slightly
smaller wheels may be fitted outside the front wheels giving extra
traction on soft ground.
The engine, manufactured by Bussing Nag, is a water-cooled,
100 horsepower, gasoline type. The superstructure is built by
Deutsche Werke, Kiel.
This vehicle carries the same nomenclature as its 8-wheeled
counterpart . Model 231 is the heavily armored variation carrying
both the cannon and the machine gun. No. 232 is a wireless command
vehicle and No. 263 an armored wireless vehicle without
the 20 mm gun .
These cars are used for reconnaissance, police patrol work,
as command vehicles, and as radio receiving and sending stations .

-AAT1TANK GUN
3.7 cm Pak
The 3 .7 cm, formerly the chief German antitank gun, has
been largely replaced by the 5 cm (1 .97 in.) ; antitank gun. A
stick bomb, 6 1/4 inches in diameter and with an overall length of
29 1/8 inches, has been recently introduced for use with the gun.
The bomb, a hollow charge type, has a steel rod which fits into
the bore of the piece, and a perforated sleeve which fits around
the barrel. Its use is likely restricted to short ranges .
The gun is normally towed on its own wheels by a tractor
but may also be carried on a lorry . Weighing 950 lbs ., it is a suitable
weapon for use by air-borne troops.
The piece consists of an ""A"" tube, jacket and breech ring
combined. The breech block is of the horizontal sliding block
type with a hand operated block stop .
The axle incorporates independent suspension which is, however,
locked when firing, the freeing and locking being controlled
by the opening and closing of the trail legs .
The lower carriage has a pivot housing and bearing face for
the top carriage. It also carries the traversing rack, the travelling
clamp and the locking gear for the trail legs and houses the axle .
The layer stands on the left side of the weapon and operates
the traverse with his right hand by a small handwheel (clockwise
to the right, anticlockwise to the left) . The arc of traverse is 60 Â° .
The arc of 21 Â° elevation and 13Â° depression is completed by 32 1/2
turns of the handwheel, which the layer operates with his left hand .
A hydraulic buffer and spring recuperator are provided .
The straight tube telescope sights are mounted on an upright
bracket carried on the top carriage.
The shield is composed of the gun shield and leg shield, of
3/16"" armor plate . The leg shield folds under the lower carriage
when travelling, and folds down to ground level when in action .

5 cm Pak 38
The 5 cm Pak 38, introduced during the 1941 campaigns in
Greece and Egypt, was developed to combat the more heavily
armored vehicles of the Allies .
The gun has a barrel of monobloc construction, threaded at
the muzzle for attaching a two-baffled muzzle brake . Because of the
position of the breech-operating cam, a minimum length of recoil
of approximately 18'/2 inches is needed to operate the semi-automatic
breech mechanism which, is of the sliding horizontal block
type. The recoil recuperator system is hydropneumatic.
The carriage, constructed of welded steel, is mounted on metal
disk wheels with solid rubber tires . Torsion springs which support
the gun in travel are automatically locked when the tubular
trails are spread. A 5 mm armor shield and apron protect the gun
crew. The left side of the shield has a sighting port .
There are four types of ammunition fired from the Pak 38 :
an armor-piercing capped, high-explosive, ballistic-capped projectile
; a high-explosive shell and an A.P .-H.E. (uncapped) shell.

MULTI-PURPOSE GUN
8.8 cm Flak 18, 36, 37
This multi-purpose weapon emerged as the most highly
publicized artillery piece of the German army during the North
African campaign. It is primarily an antiaircraft gun adaptable
to antitank and general artillery use . In its antitank role it is fitted
with a shield . In its mobile form it is towed on four wheels,
usually with an 8-ton half-tracked tractor .
The tube assembly of the gun is of a construction not come
parable to any design now in use in this country. It consists of an
outer tube or jacket, an inner locking tube and a loose three-section
liner. The front and center sections of the liner are keyed in place
so as to align the rifling and prevent relative rotation .
The mount is provided with two outriggers for stability when
firing in traverses other than directly front or rear . These are
hinged to the bottom carriage to travel in a vertical position .
During firing the outriggers are let down and secured by half-round
locking pins .
The mount is equipped with three means of fire control depending
on the usage : data transmission for antiaircraft fire, direct
laying for antitank fire and indirect laying for indirect fire .
Specifications listed herewith are based on tests conducted at
Aberdeen Proving Ground of a captured 88 mm model Flak 18,
under Ordnance Program 5772 . The mechanical-type fuse setter
and the azimuth indicators were examined at Frankford Arsenal .
The differences implied by the nomenclatures, Flak 18, 36 and

8.8 cm Flak 41
This new German multi-purpose 8 .8 cm gun is built on massive
proportions. The piece, which has an overall length of approximately
262 inches, has a built-up tube with a securing collar
at the forward end of the jacket .
A breech mechanism of the horizontal sliding type is operated
manually by a handle on top of the breech ring ; it may also be
operated semi-automatically, opening 'action and extraction taking
place during counter-recoil, and closing action following when a
round is rammed home .
The hydropneumatic recuperator cylinder is fitted above the
barrel; and the buffer is in the cradle . A lug riding in a cam below
the left trunnion is geared to rotate the control rod, varying the
length of recoil with the elevation . Spring equilibrators are located
on either side of the upper carriage .
The elevating mechanism is of the single rack and pinion type .
Three elevation speeds are provided and selected by positioning
a lever on top of the gear box to which the handwheels are fitted .
Three traverse speeds are also provided and selected in the same
manner as the elevation speeds .
The cannoneer has the choice of two sitting positions . For
direct fire he sits facing the front and fires the gun by pressing an
electric push-button with his right foot . The left foot rest, when
not depressed, brakes the traverse . When sitting in the antiaircraft
position, the cannoneer faces the side of the gun and matches
pointers . Here again the left foot rest is a brake pedal, braking the
traverse when released . The gun has a total traverse of 360Â° . The
gun crew is protected by a shield 5/16 inch thick and 7 feet, 3
inches high. Both steel casing and normal casing shells are used.

LIGHT FIELD HOWITZER
10.5 cm 1.`~.A 18 (M)
GERMAN*
In order to obtain longer range, the 105 mm German Howitzer
1 . F. H. 18 was modified so that the muzzle velocity of the weapon
could be increased. The Germans accomplished this by preparing
a new propellant charge (Fern ladung-long range charge)
which increases the muzzle velocity from approximately 1,542 feet
per second to 1,772 feet per second, and the range from approximately311,670
yards to 13,500 yards . To compensate for the increased
velocity and the resulting recoil, the Germans found it
necessary to add a muzzle brake. It was also necessary to slightly
modify the recoil mechanism and to increase the nitrogen pressure
in the counterrecoil cylinders from 730 pounds per square inch to
854 pounds per square inch. To differentiate between the two
models, the letter ""M"" (Mundungsbremse-Muzzle Brake) was
added to the old nomenclature, hence the later model is known as
the 1 . F . H. 18 (M).
The tube is of monobloc construction . The weapon has a
continuous pull firing mechanism and a breech mechanism of the
horizontal sliding type. The carriage, of riveted and welded steel,
is equipped with split trails, folding spades, wooden wheels with
rubber tires, and a protective armor shield 4 mm thick . It also
has hand operated friction brakes .

1ST LIEUTENANT THOMAS B . RUTLEDGE,
751st Tank Battalion (M), Fondouk, 12 April
1943.
One thing that I have learned : The next
time we move up, before we close up on the
objective, it is a good thing to look down on
the ground in front of the objective, and if
you see anything that looks like the enemy or
enemy guns, fire away at it with canister .
We were so close that with keen observation,
even two or three rounds or some machine
gun fire would have downed many machine
guns. I believe this would save us a lot of grief
afterwards . We know there are lots of mines,
but when approaching the objective we seem
to forget those machine guns . So, instead of
covering the ground in front of the objective
with machine gun fire, we thought only of the
objective, which was on the hill.
Did you see any of these antitank guns?
Not a great deal; only after I got behind
them.
How close were you then?
It could not have been more than thirty
yards .
Did you hit it?
Yes, with the 75-mm gun . We had to get
one out in a hurry, as I figured he may do
some more, damage. It may have been useless
expenditure of ammunition, but we had been
expending it before. At a time like this we
were always taught to shoot to kill, and it
being the first German I had seen, I thought
to dispose of him was the main thing, and we
did. We wanted to- get the gun out of action.
I saw it before I left, and it was burning,
which satisfied me .
Did you go back to the gun the next day?
Yes, it was out of action .
The camouflaged German antitank gun put out of action by Lieutenant Rutledge
52
INTERVIEWS AT THE FR_
Were you looking out the turret?
Yes.
You did not button up?
No sir, not yet. The driver was buttoned
up, but three shots hit the top of the cupola.
The enemy is known to try to pick off the
tank commander when he is sticking out . You
have to have good vision all around, but as
soon as I stuck my head out, I was fired on,
but I do not know where it was coming from .
We saw a dug-out near the members of the
enemy antiaircraft crew, and we decided the
fire was from there .
Then what happened?
We put a 37-mm high explosive shell in
front of the dug-out, the next round went
through that hole, and it exploded . They had
nice dug-outs, about five or six feet deep . I
saw the position of an antitank gun when I
had one of my tanks hit by them the day
previous . I figured the gun was facing in the
opposite direction of that one. I had in mind
to go down there as I thought there may be
other guns in the same place, when a call
came through to go back to the rallying position.
I told the driver we would be going back .
I gave instructions that we might be fired on .
I told him to keep zig-zagging, which he did,
when the antitank guns, that I had in mind,
opened up. But it was not an antitank gun
which got us . We found out the next day that
we had hit a mine which was covered with
the antitank gun fire. It was the first time I
dealt with an antitank gun, or a mine, and it
was a bad guess . We rolled into a little roadway
and I asked the driver if we were out of
action. I knew the next minute that we were
and I gave the order to abandon to the right
because the gun was on the left.
As we opened the door, the machine gun
fire started. I went to the front of the tank to
see where it was coming from, and it was
coming from both sides . We flattened out
53
and started crawling. I stayed behind the rest
with a Tommy gun. The driver was leading .
One of those guns saw us and when one man
raised up it hit him in the tail, and another
man was hit in the back and another in the
shoulder. Immediately I ordered everyone to
freeze themselves flat to the ground. We
stayed there until dark.
What time was this?
It was about ten o'clock when
abandoned the tank .
What happened then?
Well, during the day I heard the machine
guns behind us . They kept firing continuously .
They never stopped. Then, there were two
more which started firing from approximately
the same position in our front. At dark we
started crawling again and it took about two
hours before we approached friendly troops .
I was afraid that they would start firing on us,
so I told one of my men to go within hearing
distance and holler, `Friendly patrol'. We
could hear them now and then when they
raised their voices . He did so, was recognized,
toldÂ°his story, came back to us, and we moved
up. The man that was hit in the back could
hobble OK. We carried him across our
shoulders . The man that was hit in the leg
could not walk, but he did crawl for those
two hours. When this man was hit he just
clenched his fist and said `I am hit', and I
knew he was hit .
After I got in with friendly troops, I inquired
as to how close the first aid station was
for the three men. I reported to the aid station
so that they would know exactly who they
were and from what unit they came . We
walked on further and I wanted to get to a
telephone. They told me to go to the British
command car, but the line was not open, so
I asked if we could sleep there . So we slept
along side his vehicle until six o'clock in the
morning.

PRIVATE JAMES PASEK, ompany ""A"", 751st
Tank Battalion (M), near Fondouk, 12 April
1943 .
I was the radio operator in tank number
three . We started out from `A' ompany and
everything was going fine . I was sitting on one
of the ammunition boxes and was watching
tank number two through a vision sight . We
were swerving to the right and left. They
started shooting . Someone then calls out,
`They've hit the tank commander of tank number
two'. We kept going when suddenly our
tank commander yells out, ""We are in a mine
field"". They all thought it was an 88-mm gun
that was shooting off . I picked up a rifle and
went with the others until we saw our boys
near the mine fields. You could hear the armor
piercing shells, and you knew they were that
because when they hit they did not explode .
The rest of the crew went back -to a shallow
ditch. We thought it was best to stay with the
tank until we could not do any good.
Tank number one was coming to the left ; I
ran out twenty feet or so to try to flag it down,
and I was successful. We had tried to flag
down another tank previous to that, but the
tank commander probably did not see us, and
they hit the mine field too .
They kept firing the armor piercing shells
and when one hit a mine field near me there
was a terrific explosion, that's when I was
really scared . A tank came along and I said
I would lead them out of the mines and I led
them up to the road about a mile away. It was
my idea for them to come out on the same
tracks we had come in on . After this I went
back to the boys, for I could not leave my
crew, who were watching for the infantry and
guarding the tank. I really feel proud of our
crew-the best there is . My only regret is that
I could not get up to that hill. -
How are the radios?
Fine; I cannot complain. It's only an interphone
; actually, I am a radio tender.

ORPORAL STEPHEN J . SIRA USA, ompany
""B"", 751st Tank Battalion (M), near Fondouk,
12 April 1943 .
Are you a tank driver?
Yes, sir, I am a tank driver .
Tell me how you drive the tank so that other
men may get to learn something of it .
From the start you have to keep up your
motor at all times to 1500 revolutions, and
never let it get lower than that, because when
she gets below 1500, the tank is no good as it
has no pick-up .
How do you know where to go?
The tank commander directs me.
Do you pick the ground?
Yes, I pick the ground .
Do you try to keep your front towards the
enemy?
Well, we kept it towards the hills as much
as we could.
Have you ever picked up any targets?
I did not until we were behind it.
What did you do then?
I stopped . You always stop when they fire.
What about stabilizers?
The stabilizers do not work on rough
ground. Our stabilizer was in maintenance,
and they did not fix it in time .
Did you worry about it?
No, sir.
What did you do when they started firing at
you when you left the tank?
We were lying as still as we could . Every
time we moved, they would open up .
Did you lie flat?
Yes.
What do you do yourself in the way of
maintenance when you can't get help?
We drain the carburetor, grease the throwout
bearings and support rollers . We have
INTERVIEWS AT THE FRONT
steel tracks . The cactus juice and sand gum
up the support rollers . We've burned out
three of these steel tracks .

PRIVATE RAYMOND HRISTY, ompany "" "",
751st Tank Battalion (M), near Fondouk ; 12
April 1943.
What do you do?
I am the tank driver of tank number one .
What happened to you?
When we started up the second time, we
went through an orchard, and when we got
on the south side of the orchard, we turned
right and drove on the right side of the Pass
a little way, and then into the Pass, then drove
50 or 75 yards and turned left . We went
straight into the Pass and turned right again
and across the road. We went around 50 feet
when they shot us in the left track with an
armor piercing shell . The lieutenant said to
me, `Let's try to get through with one track' .
We drove about 50 or 60 feet when another
shot hit us. I started to go out through my
escape door. The turret was turned so that the
gun blocked the way . When I called to the
other boys to revolve the turret so I could get
out, I found they were all dead . I went over
and got out through the assistant driver's door,
and ran back until OLONEL HAMMA K
picked me up .
Was he in his M4 tank?
Yes, I stopped him . Other tanks wanted
to pick me up but I motioned them to go on .
Did he take you right into the tank?
No, but I rode on it .
Was he inside the turret?
He was inside and I was on it and it kept
moving. The turret cover was open .
Well, what trick would you tell other drivers
about driving?
Keep moving and not in one direction ;
keep zig-zagging . I would say, when firing,
55
always stop even to shoot just one shot . Pick
out a good firing position .
Do you try to get a position that covers the
tank?
Yes, always.

LIEUTENANT OLONEL McPHEETERS, oinmanding
91st Field Artillery Battalion, Armored,
1st Armored Division, near Lessouda,
17 April 1943.
At Sened, when these enemy tanks broke
through a sort of hysteria took hold of everyone.
The tanks were knocked out but the
hysteria continued. I had to halt one column.
We got the retreat stopped.
In a definite prepared tank attack, the artillery
should be as far forward as possible to
give maximum support. As the attack progresses,
keep displacing forward, one battery moving,
two firing.
Keep the men in the MTs . They are better
than any slit trench . Most of our' casualties
were from running during a shelling or a
bombing. Hit the dirt even if there is no hole .
The forward observers should be where
they can best see . Often it is with the infantry,
but sometimes from a point of vantage some
distance from the supporting unit . However,
wherever he is, he must make his presence
and whereabouts known to the supported
unit's commander.
We do not have enough forward observers
to have one every 500 yards along the front.
They have to place themselves carefully.
When the drive through Maknassy bogged
down, Division Artillery took over control of
five battalions . Observation was difficult and
the enemy was dug in .
In an attack by one of our infantry battalions,
we had two observers with the battalion.
We have one for the normal defensive
position. The infantry designated targets
simply by showing them to the observer .
r4 N/ ER5 /N TUN/5 /A
We have fired, sensed by the tankers and
infantrymen . They give the coordinates . We
fire one round of smoke for them to pick up;
when they get near enough we fire for effect .
In this division we are lucky to have a number
of officers, commanding tanks and infantry,
who know artillery, i.e. -LIEUTENANT
OLONEL HIGHTOWER, Field Artillery,
First Armored Regiment; ROSBY and
BLODGETT have learned to adjust fire .
We try to get the infantry to understand
the use of defensive concentrations for use
day or. night. The big difficulty is that they
don't know what these concentrations are for,
and that they can be used to great advantage .
I arrange to have my forward observers
adjust by daylight on certain vulnerable sectors.
The concentration numbers are given to
the -infantry commander to be fired on call
day or night. The new officers don't seem to
understand the value of such support. For
instance, oh the sector north of Maknassy the
infantry outpost commander was changed.
The old commander failed to give the new any
information of the prepared artillery fire in
his sector.
The forward observers must report to the
commander of the supported unit . Failure to
do this has, on several occasions, made our
artillery support ineffective . I jumped on the
otlgervers hard about it .
My objective would be to train every tank
crew for indirect fire .
This division has made four trips up the
Maknassy Valley. The enemy, with his good
observation posts, can defend with very few
troops. We got the high ground south of Maknassy
only because someone had the initiative
to do it on his own hook.
We .must learn to make better use of high
observation posts . I was able to do good work
on the Gum Tree Road because I was the
only one who had high observation posts . I
56
kept the observation post ahead of the advance
all the way up the valley .
I think too many of our troops are scared
of being shot at. There is a time to be cautious,
but the reconnaissance must draw fire, it is
their job.
I got so Goddam mad at this 155-mm gun
battery next to my command post. Because
the German 170-mm guns had fired on his
battery, he wanted to move back out of range .
His mission was to knock out those 170's .
When he asked permission to move, GENERAL
WARD said yes, he could displace forward
anywhere he wanted. We moved him up
another 2000 yards and silenced the 170-mm
guns. However, with those big guns, because
of the muzzle blast, you have to use discretion
about ceasing firing when you get counter
battery.
This Nebelwerfer 41 (German multi-barrel
mortar) made me so damn mad . It scares
the devil out of the front line troops (20
rounds in 10 seconds) . I took our Piper ub
and went to 6000 feet, found him, and got in
some rounds for effect . He shut up.

A BRITISH GENERAL OFFI ER OF THE WIDEST
TANK EXPERIEN E, Tunisia, 16 April 1943 .
In my opinion the Sherman is the finest
tank in the world, better than anything else
we have and also better than anything the
Germans have. It will be the best tank for
the next five years. The German Mark VI is
definitely no good. It will go only 1000 miles
on its own power; hence it must be hauled
everywhere it goes; and it can't be hauled by
rail because of its width. It can't be carried
anywhere in Europe. The use for light tanks
in the future, now that we have the Sherman,
is for reconnaissance .
If peeps are sandbagged the legs and feet,
which are usually hit by mine explosions, can
be protected from mines .
AV TERV/EWS AT THE FONT
Tanks should be run only one mile faster
than their lowest economical speed in order
to save the clutch.
The British mark their tanks by regiments,
by painting in large black letters on the backs
of their Shermans the names of cities, etc .
Painting the name in letters just as big as possible
on the stern flat works well .
Self-sealing gasoline tanks for tanks are
nice, but they are not vital . It is the ammunition,
not the gasoline, that burns . German
tanks burn too if ammunition is hit . I think
that the German aims to hit our ammunition .
In one battalion 15 tanks were penetrated ; 11-
of them burned, 10 because of ammunition . In
these 15 tanks there were only 15 casualties . I
estimate that casualties in destroyed tanks
are between 1 and 2 per tank, but closer to 1 .
In another battle 15 tanks were penetrated ;
7 burned, all but 1 by ammunition fires .
We must get away from the idea that
tanks can work alone . Tanks can take terrain
but can't hold it. The tank is, in my opinion
an assault weapon-not an indirect firing
weapon. However, in a regiment of tanks in
attack, 1/3 of them should be used for neutralizing
fire .
It takes three months to train tactically a
tank unit.
A good drill is to have tanks shoot at each
other with small caliber weapons . Try to hit
the ammunition compartment . The only good
way to fire Shermans is covering each other
and firing from hull down positions . It is important
to continually work ammunition towards
the gun-take every opportunity to refill
ready clips and the ammunition rack in
turret.
As to buttoning up tanks in combat, the
commander should not be foolhardy but he
must look around . A tin hat is necessary when
the commander exposes his head .
57
To pick up a casualty, drive over the man,
pull up the escape plates, have the assistant
driver reach down with his feet and roll the
wounded man face down, and then pull him
in shoulders first.
A good drill in combat practice is to bang
the tank with a hammer and say the tank is
burning. I used this signal to rule out tanks
and train the crews to get out.
In battle the mention of `withdrawal' is
fatal.
The Germans' 50-mm antitank guns are
more damaging than the 88-mm, because they
are harder to find and so many more of them .
Smoke is indispensible when caught under
antitank fire ; and is especially useful when
working with infantry, to point out objectives
such as antitank guns ; to screen their movements;
and to cover them while clearing
mines. It is also useful for recovery of vehicles .
Keep on your own side of the smoke .

APTAIN HENRY . TIPTON, Parachute Infantry,
Aide to BRIGADIER GENERAL T . J .
AMP, Krerouf, 10 April 1943. Log of advance
by ombat ommand ""A"" of the 1st
Armored Division .
LIEUTENANT OLONEL HIGHTOWER
of the Staff of ombat ommand 'A' of
the 1st Armored Division gave the word `go'
for ombat ommand 'A' at 1235 . The ombat
ommand was marching from various
initial points to force Rebaou Pass south of
Faid Pass, sweep the valley east of the mountains
to the north with the objective of Krerouf,
and the further mission to make contact
with the 34th Division near Fondouk .
BRIGADIER GENERAL McQUILLAN,
in command, moved in his tank followed
by his scout car, and directed the attack
by radio . He left ombat ommand 'A'
bivouac west of Sidi hou Zid at 1310 .
T N/ E/ 5
GENERAL AMP followed in his jeep .
LIEUTENANT T. E. HILLIARD and I took
turns driving . him because the driver was
killed last week when the jeep got bombed
and shot up . We helped each other keep in
the track of GENERAL McQUILLAN'S
tank and scout car so as to avoid mines. We
had sand bags on the floor of the jeep. The
attack went well and GENERAL McQUILLAN
quickly forged to the front of the
column, checking the readiness of the units to
fall in as he passed . The start was timed so as
to go through the mine field as soon as it was
cleared by the engineers.
We met an artillery outfit at 1425 halted
at the side of the road ; they said they were
waiting for the advance guard. GENERAL
McQUILLAN pushed them ahead and he outdistanced
us. Near the Pass of Rehaou at the
/ N ~!/ N / 5 / 4
mine field the column was halted . GENERAL
AMP walked ahead and found reconnaissance
elements halted ; they said they thought
the road was blocked . At this same time
OLONEL SUTHERLAND, of GENERAL
McQUILLAN'S staff was ordering the same
elements to resume its march . These people,
sitting in the road doing nothing, was an example
of what one vehicle can do to a column
of troops . It was holding up the entire ombat
ommand and the road was absolutely
clear in front. The trouble was that three or
four empty peeps of the mine-sweeping detachment
had parked on the shoulders of the
road. You could get between them, but it
sort of looked like the road was blocked .
We went through the Pass at 1525, had
covered 18 miles in two hours and fifteen
minutes. I saw one vehicle disabled by an
ontact near Fondouk, 10 April 194 â¢.4, between a peep of
the 34th Infantry Division and a scout car of ombat
ommand ""A"" of the 1st Armored Division
58
antitank mine. We caught up to GENERAL
McQUILLAN and reached the road west
from Faid at 1615. This was 25 miles from the
start. GENERAL McQUILLAN called up
his reconnaissance and directed full speed advance
on the objective. His reconnaissance
still lagged and he goaded them on by taking
the lead himself, but soon outdistanced them
and reached his objective, Krerouf, at 1730,
39R miles from the start . This speed was
based, in part, on the fact that Arabs were
grazing their camels along the road. We knew
that the camels were valuable and that the
Arabs probably wouldn't put them where
there was going to be any shooting . We took
it easy and put our guns to safe when there
were camels close by.
On the main road on the way up there was
a fork in the road, and we asked a friendly
native who was standing there where the Germans
were. With a shout of laughter he said,
`The Germans! Whoosh!' and he accompanied
his `Whoosh' with a wave of his arms up the
road over the mountains to the northeast, indicating
that the Germans had gone in a
hurry.
Krerouf was where two unimproved roads
crossed each other ; it was marked by a road
sign. GENERAL McQUILLAN radioed
that he had reached his objective and changed
to his scout car from his tank and GENERAL
AMP went into the scout car with him. He
started on to contact the 34th Division near
Fondouk. HILLIARD and I followed in the
jeep, as the get-away men of the patrol . The
tank slowed down a little and wouldn't push
fast enough, so GENERAL McQUILLAN
INTERVIEWS AT THE rRONT
59
ran his scout car ahead of it and led the way
for a while . After that he let the tank take
the lead again and the sergeant really made
that tank run . We contacted the outpost of the
34th Division 17 miles further north, near Fondouk,
at 1830. We had then made 56% miles
from the start . The outpost was surprised
when the tank bore down on them. GENERAL
McQUILLAN radioed back the contact.
The outpost was living high on German
supplies.
On the way we had passed all kinds of
abandoned German equipment and often had
to run around grenades and other stuff in the
road. We went back to Krerouf and on the
way there came a request over the radio for
confirmation of reaching' Krerouf. Apparently
no one believed we could have gotten there so
quickly. We stopped for an Italian motorcycle
that was in perfect condition except for three
broken spokes . An engineer colonel was with
us and he had us tie a tow rope on it and jerk
it around a little to be sure there were no
booby traps. We loaded the motorcycle in the
jeep and when we got back to camp GENERAL
McQUILLAN'S aide started running
around on it.
A few loads of Germans who had been cut
off by our advance were being collected, and
in the blackout a truck loaded with prisoners
ran into and completely wrecked our peep
that was carrying our baggage up with the
rear echelon of the ommand Post. The driver
wasn't hurt.
This tactical advance was conspicuous for
its lightning speed and determination .

RESUME OF REMARKS BY LIEUT.-GENERAL
G.G. SIMONDS, CBE, DSO
GOC 2nd Canadian Corps, at O Group Conference held at 2nd
Canadian Corps Conference Room, the Chateau, Cairon, on 30 July 1944
at 1000 hours (reported by Major A.T. Sesia).
General Simonds said that he wanted every Commander to understand
that at the present time the task of 2 Cdn Corps is a holding one and
certainly not the type that Commanders and troops will look forward to.
Our next operation will probably be a breakthrough and when that operation
77
has been mounted no division will stop until every reserve has been
employed. There will be no holding back whatever. Naturally, continued
the GOC, such an operation would not be mounted unless the prospects are
more than good but he told the assembled officers to bear in mind that he
will not stop because the forward battalions are stopped, nor will he stop
until every reserve has been employed and used up. General Simonds
explained that he took this view because he has felt that the time has now
come when we must consider that if we are going to put an end to this war
at all it can only be done by a knock-out blow. The enemy, weakened as he
is on all fronts, can still resist for a long time with the resultant unnecessary
loss of lives to us. He said that we must be prepared to accept initial
casualties but in the long run it would pay much higher dividends in (a)
finishing the war, and (b) reducing the overall wastage of casualties that
would normally ensue from a war of attrition.
General Simonds then went on to discuss the strategic picture as it
affected 2 Cdn Corps on its immediate front. He commenced by likening
the Germans position in the Caen sector to that of the situation he had found
himself last winter in Italy when the main pivot of his defensive role lay in
Pescara. He said that the Caen pivot is the enemys Pescara of Normandy.
The defence of Rome rested with the Rome Line which extended laterally
across the Italian Peninsula to Pescara. If he were denied the laterals from
Rome to Pescara he would either have to denude his stronghold in Pescara
to reinforce Rome, or fall back on both fronts. Here in Normandy the main
pivot of his defences and the determining points between an orderly
withdrawal or a rout rested with the strength with which he held the Caen
sector. A glance at the map revealed that so long as he held Caen in spite
of his weakening position on the American front he was still able to swing
back northeastwards in an orderly fashion and later, if need be, commence
a gradual withdrawal to the North keeping control at all times. This
explained his sensitivity in this particular sector, and it was more important
to him to keep concentrated as much armour and heavy weapons as he
could. The position that he holds by occupying the high ground in front of
us places him in the same advantageous situation that Pescara did for him.
He cant let go unless the situation deteriorates, and it will continue to be
his pivot back behind the River Odon.
Our immediate task is to make the threat to this pivot so serious that
he will not dare to reduce the strength of the force which he now holds
there. For that reason it is up to us to continue to make a show of force, and
if necessary, from time to time to move armoured brigades in daylight down
to the forward areas and trickle them back under cover of darkness.
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
78
Totalize and Tractable
General Simonds said that it is his task to watch for the opportunity when
the Boche weakens that pivot and then crack through. Once this takes place
his whole position in Normandy collapses. This is the time when there will
be no holding back, because it will be the finish of the enemy as far as this
phase of the war is concerned, unless he decides upon a general withdrawal.
General Simonds said that from his experience in fighting the Boche
he has found that if we attack him on a narrow front he recognizes it as a
holding attack and lets it spend itself out, and then counter-attacks in his
own time. By far the greatest contributing factor in a holding role is to
contain a large concentration of armour and guns. This is at present being
achieved and so far there has been no indication that he has moved any of
his better Panzer divisions from the Corps front.
General Simonds said that effective 1730 hours this evening 4 Cdn
Armd Div will have completed their take-over from 3 Cdn Inf Div who are
going back to rest, and that to ease this Division gradually into the feel of
things, he is contemplating a small-scale operation to recover Tilly la
Campagne. He considered that it would be advantageous for us to dominate
the feature on which this town stands and it would minimize enemy
observations of our movements.
For the future, the GOC said that if all continues to go well on the
American front to look for instructions for a break-through to Falaise. He
considers that for this operation he should employ not less than three
infantry divisions and two armoured divisions with an armoured brigade
with each infantry division, and possibly a third armoured brigade in
reserve. He said that he would not mount the operation without complete
air support. The main problem which we are going to be up against is how
to get our armour through the gun screen. It was possible in the past for our
medium guns to knock out and brew up enemy armour and gun
emplacements. But now he has anti-tank guns and tanks with long effective
fields of fire. One or two effectively concealed 88mm guns could knock out
a whole regiment of tanks before discovered. Our mediums can still knock
out the old Mk IV but the Panther and Tiger tanks are a different
proposition. At the present time the solution seems to rest in the
employment of heavy four-engined bombers and rocket-bearing Typhoons.
A 4,000 lb block buster will turn over a Panther or Tiger tank on a direct
hit or near miss. Our rocket-bearing Typhoons have proved very effective
during recent days, but it must be realized that in employing air support in
this manner that there is a definite time-lag which gives the Boche an
opportunity to recuperate from the effects of the attack by the time either
79
our armour or the infantry get through.
General Simonds said that he was certain in his own mind that the best
solution to this problem would be to employ armour at night, although he
knew that the armour people themselves were reluctant to attempt this. He
felt that if effectively carried through, it could be possible at night to bring
armour up forward at least 5,000 yards. He realized the disadvantages such
as the enemys effective flares for spotting, the difficulty in keeping
direction and the dust raised by air bombing which would make it almost
impossible to see ahead. He thought, however, that by employing this
armour at night and using moonlight or artificial light from searchlights, if
there was cloud cover, the tanks will get up to the gun screen, and he wants
the armoured formations to practice moving forward to objectives in the
dark. He said that our light AAcould deal with enemy flares and, of course,
artillery support would be available to the shoot up area where the flares
came from. He was not minimizing the risk of such operation but risks had
to be accepted if armour was to brought to the line of guns. For air support,
he would call for a heavy bomber force such as that used in the attack on
Caen and this would be employed at dusk. He would then arrange for these
bombers to make a return trip and resume their attack as early after first
light as it was possible for the bombers to refuel and return. The whole
bomber effort would depend a great deal on this turn around.
General Simonds then reiterated some of his main points and the
conference ended.

APPRECIATION
31 JULY 44
1. Object  To break through the German positions astride the road Caen-
Falaise.
2. The Germans have a forward prepared defensive position with its
F[orward] D[efended] L[ocality] on the general line May-sur-Orne 0259 
Tilly La Campagne 0760  La Hogue 0960 and a rearward partially
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
80
Totalize and Tractable
prepared position on the general line Hautmesnil 0852  St Sylvain 1354.
The high ground point 122 in 0756 is the key to the first and the high
ground about Hautmesnil 0852 the key to the second. Both are obvious
objectives and ones for which the Germans will fight very hard.
3. The positions are manned by as good troops as the German Army
possessed. The area is the pivot, which, from the German point of view
must be held as long as they fight West of the River Orne. The position is
presently manned by 1 SS [Panzer Division] Right and 9 SS [Panzer
Division] Left. Available information indicates that each division has one
infantry regiment forward, supported by all the available tanks and Sps,
whilst the other infantry regiment works on the rear position, and is
available to form the nucleus of a defence in the event of a break in
forward. The Germans apparently rely on being able to get tanks and Sps
back, but ensure that some infantry will be available in the rearward
positions from the onset, in the event of forward positions being over-run.
Two break in operations are required to penetrate the German defence.
12 SS [Panzer Division] Div may be regarded as in close reserve opposite
our front and counterattack against our East flank must be expected.
4. The ground is ideally suited to full exploitation by the enemy of the
characteristics of his weapons. It is open, giving little cover to either
infantry or tanks and the long range of his anti-tank guns and mortars, firing
from carefully prepared positions, provides a strong defence in depth. This
defence will be most handicapped in bad visibility  smoke, fog or
darkness, when the advantage of long range is minimized. The attack
should therefore be made under such conditions.
5. During the last few days we have attacked, and done everything
possible to indicate that we intend to continue attacking, the positions
opposite to us. Tactical surprise in respect to objectives or direction of
attack is therefore impossible. Tactical surprise is still possible in respect
to time and method, but very heavy fighting must be expected.
6. If all available air support is used for the first break in there will be
nothing for the second except diminished gun support, unless a long pause
is made with resultant loss of speed. If on the other hand the first break
in is based upon limited air support (heavy night bombers), all available
gun support and novelty of method, the heavy day bombers and medium
bombers will be available for the second break in at a time when gun
support begins to decrease, and it should be able to maintain a high tempo
to the operations.
81
7. In essence, the problem is how to get the armour through the enemy
gun screen to sufficient depth to disrupt the German anti-tank gun and
mortar defence, in country highly suited to the tactics of the latter
combination. It can by done by:-
(a) Overwhelming air support to destroy or neutralize enemy
tanks, anti-tank guns and mortars.
(b) Infiltrating through the screen in bad visibility to a sufficient
depth to disrupt the anti-tank gun and mortar defence.
8. It requires practically the whole day-bomber lift to effect and if two
defence zones are to be penetrated, a pause with loss of speed and
momentum must be accepted. It is considered that this may be avoided if
the first zone is penetrated by infiltration at night but this can only be
attempted with careful preparation by troops who are to do the operation.
The plan is submitted on the assumption that the Right wing of Second
Army has secured, or imminently threatens to secure, a bridgehead East of
the River Orne, thus loosening the enemy grip on the Northern pivot.

LEADERSHIP AND THE FIGHTING SPIRIT
1. I wish the attention of every officer and soldier in 2nd Canadian Corps
directed to the citation for the Victoria Cross awarded to Major J.K.
Mahony of the Westminster Regiment (Motor). It is given in full in
Canadian Army Overseas Routine Order No. 4826 of 15 July, 1944, and
also in Canadas Weekly dated 21 July, 1944. All officers should read and
think about this themselves and immediately an opportunity offers to get
troops together, it should be read over to them, and its lessons explained.

2. The points in this episode to which I would particularly draw attention
are the following
(a) I believe that this action was the first major offensive
operation in which the Westminster Regiment (Motor) was engaged.
Because of the undefeatable combination of courage and skill in
leadership on the part of Major Mahony, they fought like well tried
veterans.
(b) There was no question of giving in because Major
Mahonys company had lost touch with the remainder of the battalion
or was cut off or under overwhelmingly heavy fire, though the fire
power brought to bear upon this company by the Germans might well
have been interpreted as overwhelming by less determined troops.
(c) Under the leadership of Major Mahony they fought on,
confident that if they did their part the fight would swing in their favour
and confident also that the rest of the unit would get through to them to
assist them, as soon as the favourable situation created by their own
action made it possible.
3. The whole episode is a fine example of determined, courageous and
skilful leadership. Leadership on the part of Major Mahony and a will to
fight on the part of his company. As the citation states, it is truly an
inspiration to the Canadian Army for all time.

O GROUP CONFERENCE BY GOC, 2 CND CORPS,
13 AUG 44
This conference was called to have a final review of the operation
(Operation TRACTABLE  Hist Offr) which commences tomorrow. There
is a good deal to be done still and I will get on with it as quickly as I can.
83
The object of the operation is to gain command and communications
passing through Falaise. Falaise is only a name. The object of the
operation is to gain control of communications passing through Falaise, and
the first stage is to capture the high ground above Falaise itself. If we
succeed and command both routes (from West to East through Falaise 
Hist Offr) there is no question in my mind that after we get ourselves
positioned we can push from there and capture the town itself.
Now the problem is exactly the same as we had the other day, viz., to
strike first of all for a break-through of depth and secondly to get through
the enemy gun screen. Armour and guns failed to gain a break-through in
the attack the other day (Operation TOTALIZE  Hist Offr). This time the
attack will be under cover of a smoke screen.
There are certain points vital to the operation which we must
understand from the very beginning. The first is that the very heavy
supporting, and long, preliminary bombardment and softening-up process
immediately before an attack warns the enemy of an impending attack and
gives him time to react. My aim is to have the leading battalions get away
and the subsequent battalions follow in depth to prevent him from
mortarting behind the initial Start Line and Forming Up area. Secondly, to
organize an attack reduced in depth so that the infantry in the advance may
reach the first objective, mop up, and then completely consolidate, gives the
enemy time to move his reserves quickly and group around a frontage of
penetration. To overcome that I intend to move the leading infantry in
converted carriers (i.e. Priests and M.14 half-tracks from 79 Armd Div 
Hist Offr) to get them over the final 100 yards.
Again, the enemy may have 88 mm guns sited in depth. The whole
purpose of the employment of armour is to get in position to deny him
freedom of manoeuvrability and this means to get the armour behind his
positions proper. The final objective for 4 Cdn Armd Div is the high ground
Versainville 1538  Damblainville 2038. The attack will be on a two
divisional front. On the right 2 Cdn Inf Div with under command 2 Cdn
Armd Bde less one regiment (27 Cdn Armd Regt which will continue to
operate with 2 Cdn Inf Div). On the left 4 Cdn Armd Div with under
command during the First Phase one infantry brigade of 3 Cdn Inf Div.
Boundaries of the attack and inter-divisional boundaries will be marked on
the map and will be issued. The Start Line is the line of track Estrees La
Campagne (1149)  Soignolles (1350). Forming Up Place for 2 Cdn Inf
Div will be the valley between Bretteville le Rabet (1050) and Renemesnil
(1152) and Forming Up Place for 4 Cdn Armd Div and one infantry brigade

Totalize and Tractable
for the first phase will be this valley south of St Sylvain (1353) where the
Polish Armd Div have been positioned for the last two days.
The leading troops of the armoured brigades will cross the Start Line
formed up very close, and go straight through across the river line (River
Laizon) to their final objectives, viz., Versainville  Damblainville. They
will be followed by the two infantry brigades in armoured carriers who will
come straight on the river line, bale out, clear the area along the river, cross
it and push south.
At this stage the follow-up brigade of 3 Cdn Inf Div and the lorryborne
brigade of 4 Cdn Armd Div will pass through the leading infantry
brigade and go straight to their objectives, point 175 (1441)  Epancy
(1641). A recce regiment will accompany the leading armoured brigade to
mop up the area when the armour attack gets there. From information that
we have the left flank of the attack is more or less open, and 4 Cdn Armd
Divs aim will be to use the armoured cars to test out the country in that it
has cleaned up its objective. 3 Cdn Inf Div will from a pivot at Sassy
(1845) which will be taken over by 4 Cdn Armd Div. The latter division
will also form a pivot at point 175 (1441) and armoured cars will operate
between the two pivots.
(Due to the great rate of speed at which the Corps Commander
was delivering his talk, it became impossible at this point to
continue taking down his remarks in shorthand, and what follows
is a resume of the gist of his remarks  Hist Offr).
General Simonds then went on to discuss the difficulties in command
that the nature of the operation involved during the first phase. With
infantry and armoured brigades operating together yet each having a
different role after securing its objectives, led the Corps Commander to say
that he did not want, for instance, the GOC 4 Cdn Armd Div worrying about
clearing up small pockets of enemy left behind while he was still probing
forward with his armour.
General Simonds said that he wanted the leading armoured brigade
formed up on as wide a front as it can move and suggested that the
armoured brigades could move through the smoke screens (which will be
laid in front of enemy defences) with the tanks about fifteen yards apart.
The idea was simply to get as much of the armour as possible through the
enemy defences in the shortest time. Each armoured brigade will move on
at least a two-front regiment. Smoke barrages will precede the advancing
forces. The actual formation of the smoke screens will be dependent on
85
wind conditions at the time that the attack goes in, but there is only one
direction from which the wind will come that will rule out the operation
altogether and that is a wind blowing directly in the face of the advancing
armour and troops. Wind conditions during the past few days would
indicate that at the time of the attack they will be most favourable. Smoke
screen flares should be laid in density and FOOs will allow their Ops
leading the armoured regiments to adjust the rate of fire and intensity
according to the rate of advance and wind conditions.
General Simonds considered that twelve miles in the hour was
practical and that that was the speed of the rate of advance at which he
aimed. He said that the leading armoured brigades would be very much in
the same formation as they were last spring in the demonstration that was
put on in England at Ashdown Forest for the Prime Minister of Canada
when the tanks drove past in formation.
In addition to the smoke screen which will commence before H-hour
and is to be fully effective at H-hour, at H minus 5 medium guns will be
employed on counter-battery work in addition to taking on all 88 mm guns
which are indicated. Between H minus 15 and H minus 5 medium and
fighter bombers are going to be asked to attack known enemy positions in
woods and orchards. This attack has to go in before the laying of the smoke
screen commences, and will have to be continued until H minus 5
(commencing shortly before H minus 15).
General Simonds said that he settled, that morning, that on H plus 2 the
heavy bombers were going to attack targets in the area where the bulk of the
tanks of the two enemy SS divisions (2 Pz SS and 1 Pz SS Divisions) are at
present concentrated. He hoped that heavy bomber concentrations would
be brought to bear at about the time that the enemy tanks will be moving in
any strength. In addition to the air programme, all 88 mm positions would
be dealt with by pre-arranged concentrations on call by medium batteries
and 9 AGRA which will support 5 Cdn Armd Bde and 2 AGRA which will
support 4 Cdn Armd Div.
In conclusion General Simonds said that he realized that putting in this
attack was pressing some of our troops who were tired but that it was quite
definite now that the enemy was preparing to withdraw from the area and
that to delay this attack any longer would destroy all advantages gained up
to this time.

1. Will you please convey to all troops under your command my sincere
appreciation to their fine achievements in the attacks beginning with our
assault against the enemy positions south of Caen on the night 7/8 August,
1944, and leading to the capture of Falaise. I believe that these
achievements will have a decisive influence on the great battles now
raging throughout France.
2. To gain surprise and speed in the break-through it was necessary to
mount two difficult operations, making great demands on our troops. The
outcome has more than justified the confidence I have always had in their
skill and resource, their courage and their powers of endurance.
3. We still have much to do and I require that all troops under command
of 2nd Canadian Corps shall put forth every effort to prevent the enemy
recovering from the blow he has just suffered. There must be no
relaxation of drive and pressure until the enemy has been finally
destroyed. We have made a good start and I am certain we have it in our
power to make a better finish.

and ran into the enemy. He was shot dead, his driver taken prisoner. On
searching the body of the officer it was found that he was carrying Copy
No. 8 of a 2 Cdn Inf Div Instruction which outlines the whole Corps plan
for the attack on the 14th August, 1944.
2. The German prisoner who gave this information stated that it was his
opinion that but for the capture of this order, we would have made a clean
break through to FALAISE on the evening of 14th August, 1944. Though
the information came into their hands very late, it enabled the enemy to
make quick adjustments to his dispositions which undoubtedly resulted in
casualties to our troops the following day, which otherwise would not
have occurred, and delayed the capture of Falaise for over twenty-four
hours.
3. Great trouble was taken to gain a tactical surprise in this operation
and it involved many intricate troop movements with corresponding
demands on the physical powers of troops before the launching of the
attack. Because of the carelessness of individuals we failed to reap the
full benefit of what otherwise would have been a complete surprise.
4. There have been other instances where officers and ORs have shown
gross carelessness in the unnecessary production of written orders, their
reproduction and the handling of marked maps and operational
documents in the forward area. By so doing they endanger the success of
an operation and the lives of their comrades. I intend to take the sternest
disciplinary action if I have any further occasion to believe that officers
or ORs are being careless in this matter. In the particular instance I have
noted, the officer primarily concerned has paid the supreme penalty.

CHAPTER 4
Acting Army Commander
When Guy Simonds was first told that 2nd Canadian Corps would be
responsible for freeing the approaches to Antwerp as well as securing
the Channel ports he seemed to regard the limitations on the resources
available to him as a challenge to his ingenuity rather than a cause for concern.
After the siege of Boulogne was underway he turned his attention to the Scheldt
and the Appreciation drafted by the Plans Section of First Canadian Army. This
document, prepared under the supervision of Brigadier Church Mann and
Lieutenant-Colonel George Pangman, focused on Operation INFATUATE,
described as the capture of the islands of Zuid Beveland and Walcheren. The
Army planners did not address the corps-level tasks of reaching South Beveland
from Antwerp or freeing the Breskens Pocket, their job was to develop a method
of employing naval and air resources as well as the promised parachute regiment
of 17th U.S. Airborne. The Appreciation also noted the availability of 5th Assault
Regiment Royal Engineers equipped with Landing Vehicles Tracked (LVTs)
known as Buffaloes.1 Five possible courses of action were outlined, including two
that could be executed if airborne troops were not available. None of the
proposals involved an amphibious assault on Walcheren. Simonds was not
impressed. (The appreciation and Simonds response are reproduced at the end of
this chapter.)

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
â 38. 13ATTALION IN RESERVE,-a . A battalion in division reserve
must be prepared to'move rapidly to a flank to extend
an envelopment, relieve a depleted assault battalion, repel a
mechanized attack, or pursue a defeated enemy, . The reserve
is located in a position where It can best support the main
attack and cover the flanks .
b. The battalion commander of the reserve battalion-
(1) Keeps himself constantly informed of the situation and
of the division commander's plans either by personal contact
with the division commander and his staff or by a liaison
officer .
(2) Maintains a liaison officer at the division command
post,
(3) Constantly studies the map and plans movements .
(4) Initiates route reconnaissance for movement of the
battalion .
(5) Keeps his battalion informed of the situation.
â 39. PURSUIT.-When it is recognized that the enemy is withdrawing,
pursuit must be launched immediately and, pushed
to the limit of endurance of the command even into the night .
Only lack of fuel or ammunition will be allowed to halt the
action even temporarily. The enemy must be given no rest
and must not be given time to regroup his forces and reorganize
his defense .
a. Armored battalion .-The armored battalion will usually
be part of the combat command in pursuit . It will usually be
reinforced with engineers, Infantry, and artillery .
b. Light tank battalion .-Light tank battalions together
with infantry and engineers will be given missions of advancing
rapidly behind the enemy, moving parallel to the enemy
withdrawing columns, and seizing critical terrain that will
block hostile retreat . Medium battalions then attack and
destroy the enemy,
c. Formations .-(1) When advancing along roads parallel
to the enemy, march formations are taken with reconnaissance
units to the front and flanks . When the enemy Is met,
deployment must be rapid in order to destroy the enemy force
at the earliest practicable moment.
(2) When advancing through scattered groups of enemy, a
partially deployed formation is taken, Part of the advance
112
ARMORED BATTALION, LIGHT AND MEDIUM

may be made across country in order to pass and cut off the
retreating enemy.
d. Observation aviation.-Maximum use must be made of
observation aviation . Air observers should report direct to
the battalion headquarters by radio or drop message, giving
the enemy situation and especially locations of large bodies of
troops.
SECTION VII
DEFENSIVE ACTION
N 40. OENERAL .-C. In defense the armored battalion is held
in reserve to be used on counterattack missions to the front,
flanks, or rear . As the tank is primarily an offensive weapon
it should not be placed in position and used as a pill box,
except when the enemy is to be ambushed. This last mission
is more suited to the tank destroyer units and tanks should
not be used for that purpose when tank destroyers are present .
b. The battalion acting alone will rarely take up the defensive
unless forced to do so by lack of fuel .
1 41 . DEFENSE or A POSITION,--a . In defense of a position, infantry
occupies the main line of resistance while tank units
are held in reserve . (See FM 17-10, 17-100, and 100-5 .) The
battalion may be part of a combat command as general reserve
or may be in local reserve for a particular section of the
line. Medium tanks are normally used in local reserve while
some medium tanks and light tanks are placed in general
reserve.
b. As a local reserve the tank battalion may be called upon
to counterattack the enemy either in the front or to the flanks
before he has reached the main defenses, or counterattack an
enemy who has succeeded in penetrating the position and
destroy or eject him .
e. The reserve position should-
(1) Afford proper concealment for all vehicles and personnel
.
(2) Be large enough to allow for dispersion of vehicles,
that is, at least 50 yards between vehicles .
(3) Have good routes leading into and out of the position
so that movement may quickly be made to previously selected
attack positions .

(4) Be out of effective artillery range, that is, 4,000 to
7,000 yards behind the front line,
d, ' he battalion commander must make plans for all
possible uses of the reserve including use in sectors other
than the particular sector in which his battalion is operating .
During organization of the defense, the battalion commander
moves or causes his battalion to move into a reserve position
as indicated by the higher commander, provides for local
security as in an assembly area, then proceeds as follows :
(1) 'Contacts the infantry commander in the sector, and

(c) Direction for each contemplated attack.
(d) Objectives .
(e) Arrangements for marking- paths in mine fields so

air in the battalion commander's half-track vehicle may be
used for this duty.
(2) The battalion commander then outlines his plans to
his company commanders and directs them to make and have
their lower unit leaders make careful route reconnaissance
to the various attack positions . He should also require subordinate
commanders to make careful employment reconnaissance,
on foot, over the area of contemplated attack. Recon-

(3) Next, the battalion commander visits adjacent tank
battalions and makes plans for mutual support . He obtains
reconnaissance data from these commanders and makes any
personal reconnaissance that can be made in the time
available .
(4) Orders for various plans of attack are then given .
They should be in overlay form or marked on maps . Each

plan is given a number and when time comes for action the
battalion commander merely calls for execution of a particular
numbered plan .
X 42 . WITHDRAWAL.-a. As Part of a general covering force,
tanks will be very useful in daylight withdrawal but are of
little value at night except in bright moonlight . As part of
the covering force the tank battalion, by rapid thrusts on a
broad front, attacks and disorganizes the enemy and thus
118
ARMORED BATTALION, LIGHT AND MEDIUM
42-43
gives other troops the opportunity to disengage and retire .
These are limited objective attacks . These attacks are supported
by available artillery. Having reached its objective the
battalion withdraws, taking with it, by towing if necessary, all
disabled tanks . The rallying point is usually the attack
position .
b. When acting alone the tank battalion uses smoke to
screen the withdrawal . A company supported by mortars and
assault guns may be used to attack as in a above, to cover
the withdrawal of the remainder of the battalion. A rear
guard is then formed .
c. Prior to withdrawal of the combat elements, trains,
except those that are absolutely essential, such as the
maintenance and medical vehicles, are sent to the rear .
43 . DELAYING ACTION,-a . As part of a larger force in delaying
action the tank battalion is used as a reserve to protect
the flanks and make limited objective attacks (par. 42) .

c . If the tank battalion is not reinforced, companies or platoons
with assault guns and mortars occupy defiladed or concealed
positions to bring fire on and force the enemy to deploy
while other tanks make flank attacks . These tanks then
withdraw to the next delaying position .
d. Delay may be in one position or successive positions .
If delay is in one position, select as strong a position as practicable,
that is, high ground with a stream In front and
flanks protected by impassable ground . If delay is in successive
positions, select these positions so that enemy artillery
will have to displace. Select intermediate positions to cover ,
withdrawal and withdraw by echelon .
SECTION VIII
SPECIAL OPERATIONS
â¢ 44 . GENERAL .-Although fundamentals are the same for
special operations as for other tank actions, certain operations
present special problems that require some change in
technique . The paragraphs below are written as a guide for
solving certain type operations . Some conditions, such as
operations in desert or in snow and ice, require special training
and seasoning of troops.
â¢ 45 . ATTACK OF A RIVER LINE-In the attack of a river line
the armored battalion is normally part of a larger force .
However, the battalion when acting alone may seize bridges
over unfordable streams, may force the crossing of streams
at fords, or may with the assistance of engineers, cross small
unfordable streams, The latter will be exceptional and the
122
ARMORED BATTALION, LIGHT AND MEDIUM
45
battalion must be reinforced with reconnaissance, infantry,
engineer, and artillery elements for such operations .
a . As part of a larger force (see FM 17-10) .-The infantry
supported by artillery and fire of medium tanks forces the
crossing, the engineers build the bridge, and the tanks then
cross . Some tanks may be ferried across early. Light and
medium tanks may be used to support the crossing by fire .
Medium tanks are more suitable for this purpose .
(1) Light armored battalion.Light tanks are held in concealed
assembly areas beyond range of hostile medium artillery
fire and move to the river at the proper time to be ferried
across or to use the bridge. An assembly point is designated
on the far bank of the river where the battalion is reformed .
Subsequently, the battalion performs such missions as are
directed . Do not close up on river bank, or move up too early .
The enemy may launch an air attack or bring artillery fire
on the column .
(2) Medium armored battalion .-The medium armored
battalion, when not 'used for fire support, is -conducted the
same as the light armored battalion in (1) above. A medium
armored battalion may be used to assist the initial crossing
by direct or indirect laying methods . When so used these
tanks are placed in concealed positions close to the river
bank, preferably on high ground. Medium tanks should not
be used to replace artillery but are used for fire on definitely
located enemy targets . Do not fire all your ammunition ;
it will be needed when the crossing is effected .

be carried out under cover of darkness and in sufficient time
to permit the bulk of the relieved force to be beyond artillery
range prior to daylight Careful planning and proper supervision
will prevent congestion of incoming and outgoing troops
at critical points
â¢ 67 The execution of the relief takes place under the direction
of the commander of the unit to be relieved ; he remains
responsible for the defense of the sector until the relief has
been completed
SECTION III
TERMINATION OF THE DEFENSE
â¢ 672 An attacking enemy through his own maneuvers
losses errors exhaustion or other cause may be placed in
such an unfavorable position that superiority passes to the
defender The latter then has a prospect of st}ccess in a
counteroffensive which aims at a tactical decision the defeat
and possible destruction of the opposing force It is conducted
as an offensive operation (See ch 9 )
â¢ 673 Should the situation change to one requiring a retrograde
movement the operation is conducted as indicated in

674-678
SECTION IV
SECURITY IN THE DEFENSE
674 Prompt and continuing security measures are taken
in those directions from which the enemy is capable of attacking
Measures for counterreconuaissance are taken by all
troops and agencies in order to screen from the enemy the
preparations and dispositions made for defense
â¢ 675 The enemy will seek to avoid disclosing the distribution
of his forces and the front of his main attack until his deployment
is completed The defense must gain contact with
the enemy at the earliest opportunity and maintain such contact
in order not to be taken by surprise Every available
means of reconnaissance is employed to locate the enemy and
determine the direction of his advance and the distribution of
his forces Additional information relating to the outlines of
the enemy's dispositions and the direction of his main attack
are sought during the delaying action of the covering forces
â¢ 676 If the outpost is at a considerable distance from the
battle position the foreground of the battle position is temporarily
occupied by combat outposts detailed from each battalion
holding a sector of the main line of resistance
677 The mission of the combat outposts is to provide local
security and gain time for troops responsible for the defense
of the main line of resistance and to deceive the enemy regarding
where the main resistance is to be encountered As
long as the main outpost position is held combat outposts of
battalions on the main line of resistance may be relatively
weak The approximate strength of combat outposts may be
directed by the higher commander When there are no
friendly troops in front of them combat outposts maintain
close contact with the enemy
i 678 As a rule a combat outpost is established by each
front-line battalion or squadron in contact with the enemy
When battle is interrupted by nightfall combat outposts
push their patrols forward in close contact with the enemy
The action of the combat outposts in adjacent sectors is
coordinated by adjacent and higher commanders

SECTION V
ANTIMECHANIZED DEFENSE
Z 679 Defensive measures against mechanized units comprise
special weapons or the special use of existing weapons
natural and artificial obstacles organization of the ground
and a warning system (See ch 6 ) Antimechanized defense
must be organized in depth
â¢ 680 The antitank gun is of first importance in antimechanized
defense Employment of antitank guns is based on a
minimum of guns in position initially to cover obstacles and
as a first echelon of defense and a maximum of guns as a
mobile reserve Based on information of hostile mechanized
forces reserve guns are moved rapidly to previously `reconnoitered
locations and so disposed in depth as to permit
timely and powerful reinforcement of areas threatened by
hostile mechanized attack
Guns intended solely for antimechanized use are kept concealed
until their special target appears ; their effectiveness
is jeopardized if their location is prematurely disclosed
Close-in protection of antitank guns must be provided by
other troops
â¢ 68 Weapons whose primary missions are against objectives
other than mechanized units are used also against
mechanized vehicles to the limit of their effectiveness
Small-arms and machine-gun fire has a limited effect interfering
primarily with the enemy's observation High
explosive and incendiary hand grenades are effective against
certain types of armored vehicles
â¢ 682 In the use of all direct laying weapons fire against
mechanized vehicles is withheld until they have come within
effective range
683 All supporting artillery must be prepared to assist in
antimechanized defense In both offensive and defensive
action provision should be made for the rapid concentration
of as much artillery fire as possible on all areas favoring the

mechanized vehicles by direct laying
â¢ 684 Antiaircraft artillery weapons are suitable for use
against mechanized vehicles Every effort is made to assist
in antimechanized security by siting antiaircraft artillery
weapons so that they may be employed against mechanized
attack In the event of simultaneous attack by hostile aircraft
and mechanized forces fire must be concentrated
against the most dangerous threat For maximum effect
against mechanized vehicles special armor-piercing ammunition
must be provided
â¢ 685 Large tank units and armored divisions are effective
means to counter hostile mechanized and armored forces
They must be used offensively in large groups on definite
counterattack missions usually for maneuver to deliver a
surprise blow against the flanks and rear of the hostile
mechanized force Their employment must be closely coordinated
with and supported by ground forces antimechanized
means and combat aviation
686 Combat aviation is a powerful weapon against mechanized
forces Bombing chemical and direct fire attacks
will be effective under many conditions It has the mobility
and fire power to strike and break up mechanized threats
before they arrive within range of artillery and antitank guns
i 687 Chemical agents may be used to restrict possible assembly
areas for armored units to cause casualties to units
in movement and to render difficult the removal of obstructions
or repair of demolitions Ordinarily persistent chemicals
will be most effective unless their use will interfere with
subsequent operation of friendly troops Under such circulnstances
the use of lung irritants tear sneeze or vomiting
gas may be advantageous
Improvised combustibles and explosives thrown by individuals
against the most vulnerable portions of enemy armored
vehicles are valuable means of supplementing close-in antimechanized
defense
i 688 Mines are an effective means of defense against mechanized
forces They can be laid or buried without prohibitive
expenditure of time and labor They usually are laid in irregular
checkerboard order in three or more rows avoiding

any strictly geometrical pattern Mine fields are installed
within the defended area as well as in front of it
Mines are useful for quickly blocking defiles and favorable
avenues of hostile approach The location of mines must be
coordinated with natural or artificial obstacles and with the
fire of antitank guns and other weapons They should be
concealed supplemented by dummy minefields and covered
by fire to prevent removal by the enemy
Mine fields contaminated areas and obstacles restrict the
movement of the troops which they are designed to protect
A record must be maintained of the location and extent of
such obstacles so that the necessary precautions may be prescribed
for the safety of troops
0 689 Natural obstacles to mechanized attack include buildings
and walls water courses lakes marshes mountainous
country stumps rocky ground and thick woods Few areas
can be classed as tankproof Undue reliance on natural
obstacles must be guarded against Guided by these considerations
the defensive possibilities of terrain must be
studied constantly from the viewpoint of antimechanized defense
in order to utilize existing natural obstacles to the
maximum
690 Artificial obstacles consist principally of mine fields
antitank ditches post obstacles barricades and demolitions
(For details see FM 5-30 ) The location of artificial obstacles
must be coordinated with natural obstacles and with the fire
of antitank and other weapons The main effort in the construction
of artificial obstacles is made on those parts of the
front possessing natural obstacles which are susceptible of
improvement ; the bulk of the antitank guns are placed to
cover the avenues favorable for tank action It is important
that obstacles be covered by fire to prevent hostile crews from
removing the obstructions Obstacles located well to the
front or flanks at critical points where the fire of antitank
guns or artillery is impracticable may serve to canalize halt
or delay mechanized units thereby providing favorable targets
for combat aviation Removal of obstacles can be impeded
by contamination with persistent chemical agents In
general obstacles demolitions mines and persistent chemical
contaminations are located where the enemy will come upon
them suddenly and be unable to avoid them

If the hostile mechanized attack succeeds in entering or
breaking through the battle position it must be stopped
thrown back or destroyed either by antitank units by mechanized
counterattack or by both means Effort is made to
break the hostile forces into small groups which can be
destroyed more easily
â¢ 69 It may be impracticable or inadvisable to direct the
main effort of the counterattack against the enemy's mechanized
force A mechanized attack once launched and initially
successful proceeds with such rapidity that an attempt to
direct countermeasures against the mechanized vehicles may
result in a direct pursuit rather than an attack A counterattack
against the base or flank of a salient may often be
more effective than one against its point
â¢ 692 A counterattack directed at the rear of a mechanized
attack will usually meet other mobile supporting troops rather
than mechanized units
Such a counterattack employs all available arms including
the mechanized forces of the defender It has the characteristics
of a mechanized attack that is it leads with mechanized
units and exploits with motorized horse and foot troops It
seeks to close the gap created by the hostile mechanized force
and to isolate and eventually destroy the enemy's advanced
elements including his mechanized forces However deeply
these last may penetrate and however great the damage
they may do once their supply lines are cut they will be
immobilized and in the end destroyed
â¢ 693 All available fire support is used in the counterattack
If the counterattack is directed against the enemy's mechanized
force this fire support should be strong in antitank
cannon
â¢ 694 Supporting combat aviation is used at the crisis of the
action to the limit of its availability It may be directed
against enemy front-line units in direct support of ground
units engaged in counterattack or to cause confusion in rear

attainment of the objective of the supported forces It is not
used on missions divergent from this purpose

CHAPTER
RETROGRADE MOVEMENTS
GENERAL
â¢ 696 A retrograde movement is any movement of a command
to the rear or away from the enemy It may be forced
by the enemy or may be made voluntarily It may be classified
as a withdrawal from action a delaying action or a
retirement
â¢
697 Retrograde movements are made to accomplish one or
more of the following purposes:
a To disengage from battle
b To avoid battle in a disadvantageous situation
c To draw the enemy into a situation unfavorable to him
d To gain time without fighting a decisive engagement
e To conform to the movement of other troops
f To permit the employment of a portion of the command
elsewhere
â¢ 698 Retrograde movements in the face of the enemy are
difficult maneuvers and require constant control and supervision
by all leaders Mechanized forces and combat aviation
have increased the difficulties in executing these maneuvers
and the necessity of organizing and occupying rear positions
prior to the retrograde movement (See par 665 )
Prompt reorganization of units careful attention to the feeding
and care of the men and the presence of higher commanders
well forward will tend to counteract the detrimental
effects of this type of action
â¢ 699 Demolitions obstructions and contaminations are
used to the maximum in all retrograde movements in order
to delay hostile pursuit to assist in flank protection and to
destroy materials and resources that may have to be abandoned
Plans for this work must be prepared well in advance
â¢ 700 Combat aviation is employed against hostile observation
aviation and to delay the hostile follow-up or pursuit
by harassing and interdicting hostile forces at critical local-

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
ities Its action must be coordinated with that of flank and
rear guards
â¢ 70 In retrograde movements maximum advantage must
be taken of available motor transportation to expedite the
rapid movement to the rear of units which have withdrawn
from action Security forces should consist of highly mobile
units
A 702 A hostile force strong in mechanized and motorized
units and combat aviation may be expected to follow up or
to pursue any retrograde movement relentlessly both by day
and by night (See also par 665 ) This necessitates continuous
ground and aerial reconnaissance to both flanks and
rear rapid movement under cover of darkness strong antiaircraft
defense and continuous all-around antimechanized
defense particularly on exposed flanks Close support by
combat aviation is essential Mobile reserves particularly
mechanized and antitank units are held out in order to
counteract wide and rapid movements to our flanks and rear
or penetration through our front and to counter any attacks
by troops transported by air
WITHDRAWAL FROM ACTION
â¢ 703 A withdrawal from action is the operation of breaking
off combat with a hostile force The general purpose of the
operation is to regain or preserve freedom of action
â¢ 704 A daylight withdrawal usually involves such heavy
losses and so great a degree of disorganization that it is
preferable for large units to hold out at all costs until nightfall
and effect the withdrawal under the cover of darkness
As a rule only rearward echelons can be withdrawn successfully
by day Small mobile forces may execute daylight
withdrawals
â¢ 705 The heavier the previous fighting and the closer the
engagement with the enemy the more difficult will be the
withdrawal
â¢ 706 A withdrawal is facilitated by concealment of dispositions
and movements by bad weather by rapidity of movement
by the careful preparation of plans and by counterattacks
Successful counterattacks often create conditions most
66
OPERATIONS
706-7 0
favorable to the withdrawal Because of their mobility and
fire power combat aviation and mechanized units are especially
suited to support counterattacks
0 707 The commander who orders a withdrawal designates
a rearward position on which the troops will prepare for a
renewal of resistance or under the protection of which the
troops may be assembled for further retrograde movement
The rearward position is selected at such distance that the
enemy will be compelled to regroup his forces displace his
artillery and renew his preparations for attack The commander
usually determines the location of the position from
the map He then issues the necessary orders for reconnaissance
of the position and routes thereto
The commander makes special provision for holding the
road centers that control the lines of communication to the
rear and the features of the terrain that afford extended
observation over the areas in rear of the battle front
708 In a daylight withdrawal in addition to the rearward
position the commander selects a suitable covering position
and details from any available reserves a mobile covering
force strong in fire power to occupy it and cover the withdrawal
of the troops engaged Artillery engineers antiaircraft
automatic weapons antitank weapons and chemical
troops are attached to the covering force
â¢ 709 The mission of the covering force is to stop restrict
or divert the advancd of the enemy in order to permit the
main body of our troops to disengage assemble and move to
the rear The successful accomplishment of this mission depends
largely on the composition and location of the covering
force and on the efficient execution of a systematic plan of
artillery and machine-gun defensive fires Often the mission
can be best accomplished by counterattack
7 0 The position of the covering force in a daylight withdrawal
is selected so that it will cover the routes of withdrawal
and the assembly position of the main body Under
certain conditions the occupation of a flank position may be
advisable in order to force the enemy to execute a time consuming
maneuver
When its mission is accomplished the covering force withdraws
to the rearward position

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â 7 In his order for the withdrawal the commander indicates
the rear position assigns zones or routes of withdrawal
to the units of the command prescribes the strength and
conduct of the covering forces fixes the hour and the priority
of withdrawal of units orders the establishment of essential
signal communication and takes the necessary steps to clear
the routes for the movement of troops Prompt starting
of trains to the new areas evacuation of the wounded removal
or destruction of supplies energetic measures for the
maintenance of traffic control construction of necessary
bridges and preparations for the execution of demolitions
on the routes of withdrawal are of importance Adequate
measures are taken to insure secrecy and for antiaircraft
and antimechanized defense Measures are instituted to regulate
or silence radio communication
The new command post is designated early and preparations
are made for establishing a landing field nearby (See
FM 0 -5 )
M 7 2 It is best usually to withdraw the least heavily engaged
units first When the terrain is favorable and the
security of the command permits it all subordinate units
may be withdrawn simultaneously However it usually is
necessary to move certain units ahead of others in order to
avoid congestion and to insure a smooth execution of the
movement This procedure also gives greater security to
the command because the units remaining temporarily in
place cover the withdrawal of those first to move In some
situations counterattack may make it possible to withdraw
first those units which are hardest pressed or which are exposed
to the most dangerous threats However when necessary
to protect the command as a whole these hard-pressed
units must stay to the last It is better to run the risk of
losing certain units than to jeopardize the whole command
7 3 The zone of action for the withdrawal should provide
the best and most direct routes to the rear position The
movement of subordinate units is coordinated by assigning
to them zones of action or definite routes Generally zones
of action are assigned to the main combat units especially if
they may have to fight while moving back Routes generally
are assigned to trains and to those units which move to the
rear under control of the higher command; such units may
68
OPERATIONS
7 3-7 7
include artillery tanks and reserves The zones of action or
routes so assigned should usually extend to the rear position
If the rear position is distant the zones or routes should be
indicated back to a distance of day's march
â¢ 7 4 At night the withdrawal of the greater part of the
forces engaged commences shortly after nightfall Small detachments
are left in immediate contact with the enemy
These detachments formed from troops nearest the enemy
should be well-supplied with automatic weapons ammunition
and pyrotechnics In view of the broad front upon which
they are deployed a single covering force commander ordinarily
cannot maintain effective control The superior commander
therefore provides artillery support coordinates
the action of the elements holding the various sectors indicates
the time of their withdrawal and prescribes their action
in case of hostile attack They may be directed to withdraw
either at a prescribed hour or upon order
i 7 5 The detachments left in contact with the enemy at
night screen the withdrawal by simulating normal activity
By firing from different positions reconnaissance of combat
patrols and sending up pyrotechnics they endeavor to create
the impression of normally held lines
Whenever practicable the foot elements of these detachments
should be furnished motor transportation for movement
to the rear Motor transportation is especially desirable
when the distance of the retrograde movement is great
â¢ 7 6 Whether the rearward position is organized for defense
or is the area in which the command will be assembled
for further retrograde movement the commander makes
provision for a covering force in front of this position The
mission of this covering force is to cover the withdrawal of
the detachments left in close contact with the enemy and
of the artillery supporting these detachments It has the
further mission of protecting the assembly of the main body
for further retrograde movement or to serve as an initial
outpost if the rearward position is to be defended
â¢ 7 7 At night the withdrawal of front line units is executed
on a broad front Troops withdraw initially straight to the
rear and then move to designated assembly areas where
small units are reformed and preparations are made for
further rearward movement and assembly into larger units
69
7 8-725
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â¢ 7 8 At night a part of the artillery remains in position
to support the elements still in contact It increases its fire
activity to deceive the enemy as to the amount of artillery in
action and assists the troops in contact in breaking off combat
Well supplied with ammunition and protected for allaround
defense this artillery sacrifices itself if necessary to
insure the withdrawal of the supported elements The remainder
of the artillery is withdrawn to the rearward position
priority in movement being given to the heavier calibers
â¢ 7 9 During withdrawals antiaircraft artillery furnishes
protection for the assembly areas the heads of columns and
particularly critical localities along the routes of withdrawal
â¢
720 Cavalry protects withdrawing troops by reconnaissance
protection of the flanks and delaying action
â¢ 72 Continuous reconnaissance is made to facilitate the
employment of antitank units to protect withdrawing troops
against mechanized attack
â¢ 722 Tanks are useful in daylight withdrawals particularly
in counterattacks to assist other ground units in breaking contact
with the enemy When practicable their action is coordinated
with that of combat aviation They are not ordinarily
used in night withdrawals
â¢ 723 Persistent chemicals may be used to deny or make
costly the use of probable approaches Smoke may be useful
in covering the daylight withdrawal of a unit over terrain
exposed to enemy fire
â¢ 724 In addition to their primary mission of effecting road
blocks and demolitions engineers reconnoiter repair and
mark roads In certain situations they reconnoiter and stake
out rear positions and furnish guides They assist the rearward
movement of artillery mechanized and other units ;
destroy materials to be abandoned ; act as part of a covering
force; and constitute an emergency reserve
RETIREMENT
â¢ 725 A retirement is a retrograde movement in which a
force seeks to regain freedom of action the movement being
part of a well-defined plan which has for its purpose the refusal
of decisive combat under the existing situation A
retirement may be made in one stage or in several stages
70
OPERATIONS
725-730
depending upon the distance involved When a withdrawal
from action precedes the retirement the actual retirement
begins when march columns are formed
â¢ 726 Without competent orders to do so a decision to retire
is Justified only when all possibilities of accomplishing the
assigned mission have been exhausted and a continuation
of the battle will lead either to excessive losses or to a decisive
defeat
No commander is authorized to order a retirement on his
own initiative simply because of local misfortune or reverses
suffered by an adjacent unit
â¢ 727 In retirements following a withdrawal the most important
considerations for a commander are to place distance
obstacles and a rear guard between his main body and
the enemy and to regain his freedom of action
Trains are put in march without delay if necessary under
escort and sent to the rear to a selected bivouac area During
their retirement they establish dumps of ammunition
rations fuel and other supplies en route to meet the needs
of the retiring troops
Antiaircraft protection of important defiles on the route
of retirement is established
As fast as troop units arrive in assembly areas they are
formed into small columns and set in motion to the rear
â¢ 728 Road march formations usually are taken up when
the zone of effective hostile light artillery fire is passed
Formations are modified to meet existing conditions of terrain
visibility intensity of enemy fire activity of enemy combat
aviation and tactical requirements for control and rapidity
of movement
â¢ 729 During the initial phase of retirement made from contact
the division generally assigns specific routes to the trains
the artillery and other auxiliary troops and indicates when
the routes will be cleared for the other troops A zone of
action usually is assigned to each combat unit comparable to
an infantry regiment in size
â¢ 730 As the distance from the enemy increases small columns
are consolidated into larger columns constituted as
combat teams During the march to the rear constant effort
is made to increase the distance from the enemy This will

necessitate night and forced marches as well as effective security
measures to protect the rear and the flanks and to delay
the enemy
â¢ 73 The actual terrain objective toward which a retirement
is directed depends upon the mission of the command
and the purpose of the movement It should be such as to
favor the future action of the command Factors which influence
the selection of this objective are the actual and
potential strength of the enemy; reinforcements that may
become available ; the time when the enemy can arrive at
critical localities on the route of the retirement ; and the extent
that terrain and the weather favor hostile movement
and interfere with friendly movements
â¢ 732 The formation and number of columns to be employed
during retirement depend principally upon the number of
roads available and the hostile interference It generally is
desirable to move the major fractions of a deployed force to
the rear simultaneously and abreast of each other However
a' hostile threat to a flank may make it necessary for one
fraction to hold in position until the movement of the others
is well under way A restricted road net or defiles in the zone
of movement may necessitate withdrawals of fractions successively
If a flank is threatened during the retirement the
adoption of an echeloned formation may be appropriate
â¢ 733 The retirement order of a small command usually
designates the time when each subordinate unit commences
its movement In commands the size of a division or larger
the commander usually designates the time that major portions
of the command pass initial points or lines and when
appropriate the hour that certain lines or assembly areas
must be cleared (See FM 0 -5 )
â¢ 734 Clearing the routes of march and organizing an effective
zone of obstacles to delay the enemy's pursuing columns
are of greatest importance
Engineers are sent back early to reconnoiter and improve
the routes of retirement repair bridges and prepare obstacles
and demolitions to be executed by the rear guard Pertinent
information of the location of obstacles and of the nature of
the demolitions and contaminations prepared is furnished to
the retiring troops Measures are taken to prevent their en-

especially in towns at bridges and at other defiles
Strong antiaircraft and antitank protection is established at
these critical localities until they are cleared by the main
body

artillery to support them in the execution of their missions

any combinationof these methods76OPERATIONS754-756754 Skillful use of terrain has a decided influence on alldelaying operationsA series of parallel ridges across thelines of hostile advance ; unfordable streams swamps lakesand other obstacles on the front and flanks ; high ground withgood observation and good fields of fire at long range ; congealed routes of withdrawal immediately behind delayingpositions ; and a good road net all favor the execution ofdelaying actionÂ® 755 In situations where the enemy has freedom of maneuver and mobile troops and the flanks of a delaying forceare open to hostile attack the protection of the flanks andrear is of vital importance Since the enemy may succeedin pushing by the flanks or in executing a wider maneuverwith mobile forces to strike in rear of an occupied delayingposition the commander must make provision to block ordestroy such forcesGround and aerial reconnaissance forces must be continuously on the alert to locate such threats to flanks andrear 756 Delaying action in successive positions is based onlimited resistance on a position with the intention of renewing this resistance in successive positions if necessaryThedefense on each position must force the enemy to earlydeployment and to time-consuming preparations for battleCombat ordinarily is broken off in each position before troopsbecome closely engagedThe situation may however requirea strong resistance on some position or even a counterattackin order to accomplish the delaying missionThe delaying measures are continued between positions inorder to gain time for organizing resistance on the next position Because of the retrograde and long range nature ofsuch combat delaying action is executed most effectively bytroops possessing a high degree of mobility and great firepower especially at longer rangesIn general contact is made as far forward as possible andcontinuous light resistance is offered in order to compel theenemy to employ his whole force and to consume a maximumof time No more ground than necessary is given up Theability to execute planned withdrawals under conditions thatpermit orderly movement to the rear must however

offeredby the terrain whereas the attacker is restricted in movementand is unable to exploit fully his superiority of meansThe ground in rear of the position should favor a coveredwithdrawal by screening the troops from hostile view and fireas soon as the position is vacatedField fortifications are reduced to the minimum ; full use ismade of obstacles demolitions and chemical interdictions infront and on the flanks of the position and in the areas between successive positions 758 The conduct of delaying action is facilitated in openterrain by selecting successive positions on high

are applicable to the infantry division046 When a division is operating as part of a higher unitrestrictions on the freedom of action of the division commander are often necessarily imposed by the higher commander In an advance the corps commander will ordinarilyprescribe a zone of advance for each division of the corpsThe road net within the zone may largely influence the marchformations and supply arrangements within the divisionThe corps may also prescribe the general line which advanceguards of the divisions will cross at a given time at the beginning of the march the extent of the march as well as anyspecial formation of the corps for the advanceFurther coordination may be obtained by designating lineswhich the various divisions must clear by specified times andby designating rear boundaries for divisions at the completionof each stage of the march047 The army or corps has reconnaissance elements whichoperate in advance of the divisionsWhile cooperation andcontact between

DUAL-PURPOSE MACHINE GUN
7.92 mm M. G. 34
The M.G. 34 is a standard machine gun of the German
Army. It cannot be compared directly with any American automatic
weapon . It is a multi-purpose weapon and is used as a light
machine gun, a heavy machine gun, an antiaircraft machine gun,
and also on tanks and other vehicles . Because of its adaptability,
it is the most common automatic weapon used by the German
Armed Forces .
Without bipod mount, the M .G. 34 weighs 24 1/4 lb., and
is occasionally fired by the use of a second soldier's shoulder as
a rest. A light bipod adapts it for prone fire and with tripod mount
this becomes a heavy machine gun.
The M.G. 34 is a recoil-operated, gas-assisted weapon, beltfed,
and air-cooled. It operates on the Solothurn rotating bolt-head
principle . A simple mechanism makes it easy to exchange a
heated barrel for a cool one . It is designed to deliver semiautomatic
or full-automatic fire .
Studies at Aberdeen Proving Ground show that it is very easy
to disassemble in the field, but cannot be regarded as an easy
gun to manufacture on a mass production basis, as compared with
the M.G. 42.
Studies of captured guns show that this weapon has a high
rate of fire-too high for a light machine gun-resulting in poor
accuracy in full-automatic operation. When used as a heavy
machine gun it shows excellent stability . It is extremely critical as
to adjustment, lubrication, and foreign matter.

DUAL-PURPOSE MACHINE GUN
7.92 mrr. M.G. 34 41
The German 7 .92 mm machine gun, M.G. 34/41, represents
one of the later developments of the M.G. 34. These developments
occurred in the following order : the M.G. 34; M.G. ' 34
modified ; M.G. 34s; M.G. 34/41 . In the course of development,
the original pattern of the weapon has been largely retained, but
each stage has tended toward simplification and elimination of
machined parts.
The M.G. 42 is a new design but has the same tactical employment
. It is distinguished by a high cyclic rate of fire and
fewer machined parts. The M.G. 42 is described on a separate
page.
The M.G. 34 modified is used principally in armored vehicles
and differs from the M.G. 34 in that it has a heavier barrel jacket
adapted to fit ball-type tank hull mounts, a simplified firing-pin
nut lock, and bipod clamps for attaching bipod in emergency use ;
it has no A .A. sight bracket. It can also be mounted on antiaircraft
and heavy ground mounts .
The M.G. 34s and the M.G. 34/41 are identical in appearance,
except for the barrel jackets, but are marked as distinct models .
They differ from the M .G. 34 as follows : provision for full-automatic
fire only; simplified trigger group; shorter barrel with
enlarged muzzle end ; elimination of firing-pin lock nut ; large buffer
group; heavier recoil spring ; modified feed mechanism. These
models can be used on antiaircraft mounts but appear designed for
the heavy ground mount.

RECOILLESS SRDULDRR WEAPONS, INCLUDING THE RAZOOBA AND PANZZHFAUST
The first widely used recoilless shoulder weapon was the
U.S. 2.36"" bazooka. It was copied by the Germans, who produced and
used an 86mm shoulder rocket launcher . This larger German weapon
has en SAT head capable of penetrating more ermor .
An outstanding German development of which there is no U .S.
counterpart is the Panserfaut . Thio gives the German infantryman
a very powerful but very short-range antitank weapon .
The Ordnance Department has developed and recently standardized
a 57mm recoilless rifle which combines the power of an artillery
piece with the accuracy of a shoulder weapon, Although this has only
recently been introduced into the theaters, it promises to be the
outstanding recoilless shoulder weapon of the war .
The Japanese have no known weapons in this class, but they
probably will produce a copy of either the German or U.S. type.
RECOILLESS ANTITANK BOMB AND LAUNCHER
Panzerfaust
The German rocket grenade (Faustpatrone-literally ""fist
cartridge"") is a new close-range Nazi weapon used against tanks
and other armored targets . It comprises a tube and a head which
contains the explosive charge . The weapon weighs 11'/4 pounds,
has a muzzle velocity of 145 f/s, and a sight range of 33 yards .
The head, which is closed at the front end by a sheet-metal
cover, includes a semispherical hollow charge . Toward the rear,
the head merges into a rod which includes the small detonating
charge 34 and the fuze. The rear of the rod is screwed to a shaft
containing four bomb-fins for flight stabilization of the rocket
grenade. When not in use, the fins are rolled around the shaft
and held together by the tube which is slid over it. The propelling
charge is contained in the tube . A sighting rail, fixed to the front
end of the tube, when folded down serves as the safety against
involuntary cocking of the striker . The sighting rail itself is in turn
secured to the rear by the Fuze Safety Pin, which holds it in foldeddown
position . The lock is located on a line extending from the
sighting rail to the rear . It includes and carries the firing-pin
(striker), release button, and safety catch .
For firing, the weapon is taken under the right arm, the left
hand supporting the grenade two inches behind the front end of
the tube . The fuze safety-pin is pulled out, and the sighting rail
is snapped up, forming an approximate right angle with the tube .
The striker is cocked by pushing the lock forward until the striker
is set and the release button emerges . The lock then slides back
into its original position, and the release button is pressed, discharging
the projectile . Discharge is recoilless, and caution must
be taken, as a stream of fire from one to two yards long is ejected
from the rear of the tube . The launcher tube is expendable.
A smaller model is known as the Faustpatrone.

PROPELLANT CHAIrBER
This projectile is used with the German counterpart of the
""Bazooka."" It weighs 7.3 pounds and consists of a bomb, propellant
chamber, and fin unit . The nose percussion fuze is similar to
that used in the high-explosive rifle grenade (Gewehr Spreng-
Granate) and the 3 .7 cm stick grenade (3.7 cm Stielgranate 41) .
This fuze is armed by setback .
The bomb body is divided into two parts which are held together
by a circular band crimped onto the two halves. The upper
section contains a cone forming the hollow charge. The booster
charge (Kz. Zdlg. 34 No .) is located in a cavity at the base of the
bomb. It is held in place by a few strips of paper . Beneath the
booster is a cylindrical block of wood .
The propellant chamber contains seven sticks of tubular propellant
200 mm long, 11 .6 mm in external diameter, and 5.6 mm in
internal diameter of the jets is 0 .5 cm (.19 in .) and the external
the center. The central stick contains a length of quickmatch in a
celluloid tube . There is no bottom igniter ; the top igniter is contained
in an aluminu holder. The composition is similar to that
found in other rocket rojectiles. It has a top covering of a celluloid-
like substance . Situated at either end of the propellant sticks
are grid-like spacers. The whole is kept in place by a jammed-in
locking ring . The tail unit contains a central venturi tube with an
electric fuze fitted to its outer end . Presumably, the electric fuze is
blown out on initiation, permitting the gases to escape . The projectile
does not rotate . I Attached to the outside of the electric fuze
is a length of insulated wire which is attached to a contact stud
fitted to a piece of wood .

their application, or from attempts to follow
book rules rigidly without due consideration
of their suitability to existing situations
3. During the Tunisian Campaign this .Head-'
quarters published periodically training memoranda
on various subjects, as lessons were
gained or weaknesses were disclosed . ` In the
following material subjects previously covered
in these memoranda will appear.
SECTION II-INFANTRY UNITS
4. In the following paragraphs the' term
""infantry refers to the troops of the normal
infantry division as distinguished from
the armored infantry of the armored division.
5. The experience of our infantry has been
extensive and varied . Its missions have included
practically all ground operations
appropriate to its arm .- Its operations have
been conducted in all types of terrain, ineluding
desert, mountains, and the inter,
mediate features between these extremes as
well as terrain types regionally peculiar', to ,
Tunisia. From this varied experience, the
outstanding lessons and subjects given below
are believed by . reporting commanders to be
of first importance in infantry training .
6. Fire and movement. ~
In almost every situation the.most important
single, element of infantry : combat is the
effective use, of fire and movement.'
7.' Observation Y and seizure of dominant,
terrain. ,,
Experience ' continually . emphasized the
necessity of ;seizing key , terrain features
which afford effective observation . Enemy
positions-'subjected' to dominant observation
rapidly . became untenable. Examples of this
experience are quoted, from the' . report of a
division commander ;
l' his 'principle has been taught
for years, yet at EL GUETTAR,
HILL '772 remained in German hands
during the first ten days of the battle .
As a ,result the enemy, had artillery
observation and was able to. fire on. anything
that moved . As soon as HILL
772 ;was captured, the German's abandoned
the, entire position .;' . . .
The principle was further borne out
in'the SEDJENANE-BIZERTE opera,
tion ' During the early days while our
enveloping force was getting into, position,
German' observation', again dominated`..
us. Our envelopment turned
ture ;; omts,, for 'artillery ,,observation
,posts was';;emphasized,;and,its importance 'has,
been,' clearly ,-stated in, the .:comment of an
artillery battalion, executive,:""
air , of every',` infantry attack
'should' be directed to' seize high ground
for :`artillery ; OP's: Without -- them,
continued'effective, - support .cannot' be
given.
8. Organization' and consolidation of cap-,
tured'Iround.
Experience': has shown' that; German forces
, invariably :launch an immediate counterattack
whenever,possible to ,regain:lost ground, and
-,precede-o:such :`attack, with , prepared : artillery,
vanelng units-:had ., to :''Jedrn to . take
immediate measures for::the : organization of
captured' ground for:' defense' and to utilize
supporting weapons of all calibers for this
urpose., On' high ground , ridge, lines had to
e""avoided as, these features` often presented
targets for ;prepared, aAMery, . concentrations
which preceded counterattack, , ,'The following
examof pthils ;,eless,on,, is . taken from the.
.:.report' .-of a division commander :
everal times, , the infantry was

now known that the German - ;'with'

BALD HILL position started : immediately
after we occupied the' two'hills :
referred to . .
Similar experience has been described' ;in the
report of another division commander :H~
AT EL GUETTAR,: the adyance
of the' Division was slow ' `and -'costly;, ,
until the -th Infantry captured' and'
strongly garrisoned the dominant . hill,
in the division sector . .Several, :OP's ::
were set up and observed .. fire;,wa's of

in the operations- around'BEJA HILL

features from which thej ;enemy
conducted a very strong defense ;Each

""""nervation passed to our. hands
In all offensive ' operations, the ;seizure o
dominant terrain features as intermediate,and
final objectives became the core-of infantr
commanders' plans, Specific ;effort to cap10.
Depth in offense and defense.
The principle of depth as applied to both offense
'and defense cannot, , be overstressed.
Disposition' and deployment' in depth, and the
mutual,'. support of all heavy and automatic`
weapons. from, positions organized in depth
.were found essential throughout the campaign;
In defense ; against armored attack, adherence
to this principle was vital.
11. Following'of artillery fires'and concentrations,
Assault.' troops learned . the advantage ; and
necessity;: *of'_ following closely the line of
impact.:of their supporting artillery concentrations
and barrages .., The distance between
assault wave , and concentration or barrage .
depends on terrain and other conditions. Reports
have indicated from 100 to 200 yards
as`effective distance without undue casualties
from "" the supporting fire. Following at
greater distance allows the enemy to recover
from the shock of the ' fire and man his
weapons effectively . ""This was conclusively

pose themselves on the skyline' after
reaching the top of a hill,, ; ;. The '';German
always places artillery fire' on,
positions he has vacated . '' In the attack
on DJEBEL CHENITI *by the
-th Infantry, advance elements stood
up on the skyline instead of, continuingdown
the forward slope and digging in .
Artillery` fire -came down almost, immediately
causing many more ,casualties
, than were suffered in ' taking"" tl Le
position. . .
9. Infantry cooperation with tanks .
The Campaign has demonstrated that' ex
cellent results can' be obtained through 'the
use of tanks with .the . troops of the infantry ,
division, as distinguished' from the normal
action of the armored infantry . It has been
found that their employment. should , follow,
the principles of cooperation,, teamwork, - and-.
coordination required for the infantry-artillery
team . Two types of infantry coopera
tion were effective, as determined by' the'
situation. Preliminary preparation for the
breakthrough of the tanks, and close' support
of the tanks in their own breakthrough . In
either case, infantry support has been indispensable
to' the tank . action, especially in
c
ti'

consolidating ' the . ground overrun by the ,
tanks
abandon,: strongly; defended positions 'at the :
heads. of,the 'corridors,,'valleys, :, and .natural ;;
approaches ""We :learned "" wrote' a division
commander at the close otfhee: campaign,
that, to live, we : must take to the
ridges and : advance along them, avoid
ing; :avenues of 'approach up valleys:
To ;; advance along valleys was . disastrous
;, ,. Taking to the^ ridges : was tedious,'.,
strenuous business' but . it saved
hundreds of .lives and gave physical
possession : of, the .high ground. Four
times this resulted in the collapse' of
strong positions,; and the""-,German was
finally ;: driven into, open country, his
resistancberoo :en, ; an , pursuit tactics
made' possible
3. Scouting and patrolling .
Scouting? ; and':patrolhng :proved to be one
of the most' serious deficiencies in the opera-
.tions of, American infantry in, Tun isia. Pa-'
trop activity, was not su fficiently .' aggressive, .
and . at times>;failure in effective scouting op-

scoutingh .and,-- .patrol ; operations. Our ex-
I 4
. .
demonstrated,"" 'reported a ' - Division, -, ommander,
who cited - the following examples :''
In early action, the infantry often
allowed artillery concentrations to lift'
so that 500 yards or more .had- to ; be' .
traversed before closing with the enemy.
This allowed the German to come :up
out of his dugouts and recover . fron the
effect of ;the` ; artillery and` man-!. weapons. As a result our attack"" was'; -
often repulsed with heavy losses .
Later at DJEBFT, CHENITI
the -th Infantry stormed the hill fo1=
lowing the artillery at 100 yards They
took only three casualties from'.`our
artillery and overran the position with,
the bayonet't before the defenders had
recovered and manned their guns: No
casualties were suffered :,otherthree
mentioned above , ,
12. Training in mountain and hill warfare .
The recent campaign has shown that ` the
basic principles of mountain and hill war-'
fare must be learned by all infantry . .,' ,'In',
order to advance successfully, ,troops .had lo
avoid natural corridors of approach, which
were invariably mined and heavily defended,
and work along ridges and . high terrain fea=
tures. In this way the enemy was'forced'to'
I'YI
i
perience has demonstrated the need . for much
higher proficiency in the subjects and func
tions requisite to these operations, including
map reading, the use of compass and, other
means of direction control, movement by
stealth, avoidance of ambush, and control of
patrolling personnel. Leaders of. p a t r o l s
must master the principles of the single objective,
individual initiative and responsibility,
alert observation, patience, clarity in the
issuance and understandng of plans and instructions,
boldness of action, accuracy in reporting,
and energy and initiative in ex ecu
tion. Prior daylight reconnaissance should
precede night patrol operations to insure
against elements getting lost or ambushed.
These principles have been summarized in the
comments of a regimental S-2, whose unit saw
continuous action throughout,the campaign :
. . . Train men intensively in 'sneaking'
and 'peepin', and 'in how to distinguish
and identify different sounds .
Teach men to step cautiously and silently,
to crawl noiselessly . Train them
in the accurate use of the compass night
and day, and in map reading. Also in
observation-half the information we
get is obtained from observation and
patrolling . . .
10
One important battle lesson has'
been the failure of junior officers to be
ice-clear and specific in instructions and
directions, . especially with regard to
patrolling, scouting, and night operations.'
For night patrol operations a
prior daylight reconnaissance must be
made. Without adequate prior dayli
ht reconnaissance, night patrols
o ten get lost . In one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ccessors established a school to train officers for
General Staff duty . Because successful military results
were achieved, France, Great Britain, the United States,
Japan, and other countries based the formation of their
General Staffs upon the model set by Germany .
Beginning with Scharnhorst, such distinguished leaders
and strategists as Moltke (the elder) and von Schlieffen
were closely associated with the development of the
General Staff School, which operated continuously from
1810 until the outbreak of World War I . Subsequent to
that war the Versailles Treaty forbade the continuance of
the school, and it was not until 1933 that the Kriegsakademie,
as the Germans call it, was officially reopened in the
Berlin location that it was occupying at the outbreak of
World War II.
During the years from 1935 to 1939, the United States
was allowed to send four individual officers to take the
course . From their illuminating reports it is possible to
learn the trend of German methods and teachings up to
Hitler's attack on Poland . Our observers unanimously
agreed that the main body of doctrine taught at the
III
IV
FOREWORD
Kriegsakademie-the body of doctrine that underlies the
German warfare of today-is set forth in Truppenfuhrung,
the German tactical bible so very similar in matter and
precept .to our own FM 100-5, Field Service Regulations,
Operations .
The following partial resume of doctrine 1 taught at the
Kriegsakadein'i`e is actually a practical adaptation of relevant
parts of Truppenfuhrung . It will be noted that this
resume (ignoring the factor of translation) is written
almost exactly as a German would instruct Germans .
This faithfulness to the tone of the original lectures has
been made possible because of the extremely adequate
reports, which were made by the U. S . officer-students.
Throughout, striking similarities will be . observed
between German tactical doctrine and . that set down in
pertinent manuals of the U . S Army. U. S. officers,
however, should not be misled by the similarities to overlook
the differences that also exist . With regard to one
of the basic similarities in doctrine, it has been pointed
out by, one of our Kriegsakademie graduates that ""Owing
to the phlegmatic nature of the German individual,
initiative and aggressive action have to be forced on the
lower leaders and staff, rank and file, whereas we possess
these characteristics as a natural heritage .

which describe various aspects of German military methods : ""The German

Section I . POST OF THE OMMANDER
The personal influence of the commander upon his
troops is of the greatest significance . He must be located
where he can most effectively lead . On the march he
should be as far forward as security permits, and his
location should be definitely known by the members of
his staff so that all reports may reach him promptly . In
the attack his command post should be located as far
forward as possible, yet protected from hostile fire so as to
insure undisturbed operation ; for tactical reasons, the post
is placed near the main effort, facilitating control at the
most important point of the battlefield . The movement
of the command post is influenced by the location of existing
wire lines, and the divisional signal officer is kept constantly
informed so that communication requirements may be
better anticipated . In a delaying action, the commander
remains in the forward position until he is convinced that
his order for withdrawal is being successfully carried out ;
then, with his artillery commander, he goes back to the
new position . In very difficult or dangerous situations,
often present while withdrawals are being executed, the
commander will remain with his troops,

Section II . DUTIES OF THE STAFF
The commander should not be troubled with details .
To insure frictionless performances, there are definite
assignments for-staff positions and duties . Each staff
maintains its prescribed strength. The tactical staff
remains with the command echelon, whereas the supply
and administration staff remains well to the rear, in the
vicinity of the trains .

Section III. ESTIMATE OF THE TERRAIN
Proper utilization of modern implements of war (artillery,
airplanes, gas, tanks, etc .) can only he accomplished
through their careful adaptation to the terrain . The
commander himself can obtain only a general picture of
the terrain ; he has, however, many supplementary means
by which he can learn the true condition of the area in
which his command is employed : for example, reconnaissance,
air photographs, maps, sketches, and questioning
of inhabitants . In judging terrain for specific purposes,
you 1 must bear in mind the plan of the commander and
the immediate task-to determine how that plan will be
influenced (aided or hindered) by the terrain .
1 . ROADS AND ROUTES
Use the best roads available as routes for supply trains :
gain protection against air observation, but avoid defiles
and narrow valleys . For combat trains, remember that
cover from ground observation is also required . How are
the roads constructed, and how will bad weather influence
them? What are the bad or impossible stretches, and
what is the possibility of avoiding or repairing them?
I The form of the material, here and at many other points, is governed by
the fact that it was presented as lectures at the Kriegsakadeinie .

What are the widths? 2 defiles and excavated passages?
bridges? I fords? 4 ferries? 6 steep grades? 6
2 . RAILROADS
Differentiate between standard gage (1 .435 meters, or
4 feet 8'2 inches) and narrow gage (1 .20 meters, or 3 feet
11'4 inches, to 0 .6 Deter, or 1 foot 11% inches) . Differentiate
also between field line, cable line, electric, and
steam . How many rails are there, and does room for
addition exist alongside the rails? After a small amount
of work on the bridges, tracks can usually be adapted
for use as marching routes for foot and mounted troops,
as well as for motor vehicles .
3 . TERRAIN FOR THE ATTA K
(a) Where will the enemy resist the attack? Where
are his advance outposts, main position, switch positions?
(b) How has he disposed his forces-infantry, artillery,
reserve? (c) Where is a position of readiness (Bereitstellung),
and how can the terrain be best utilized for advance
to it? Is there concealment from air observation?
Until what point will the attacking force be concealed
from hostile ground observation? (d) Where are covered
approaches for infantry toward the hostile position? Are
attack objectives so conspicuous and so located that concentrated
artillery fire may be directed upon them?

Where are the best positions for artillery and observation
posts? Where is the terrain most favorable for tanks?
Where does the terrain favor the enemy's counterattack?
(e) And, lastly, what kind of attack is most favored by
the terrain-penetration, envelopment, or frontal attach?
4. TERRAIN FOR THE DEFENSIVE A TION
a . General
A defensive position is frequently selected through
examination of maps . Immediately thereafter, officers
are sent on terrain reconnaissance . General Staff, artillery,
and engineer officers reconnoiter for their respective
purposes or weapons ; later, a coordinated defense plan is
built up from their information .
b. Questions To Be onsidered
Such questions as the following arise :
(a) What should be the locations of the main line of
resistance, the flank support, the outpost line, and the
advance positions? (b) Where can artillery and heavy
infantry weapons, as well as their required observation
posts, be located to bring the enemy under fire at long
ranges? (c) How can the enemy be subjected to frontal
and flanking fire immediately in front of the main line of
resistance, and where can a counterblow be effectively
delivered? (d) What obstacles must be constructed to
canalize the attack of the enemy, including his tanks, and
to cause him to advance where heavily concentrated fire
can be delivered? (e) Where will the reserves be located
to obtain cover and also to facilitate counterattacks?
(f) Should it be necessary to limit the enemy's penetra6
GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
tion, and how- can the defensive be established in a position
to the rear?
5 . TERRAIN FOR THE DELAYING A TION
Where is an effective first line of defense? Where are
lines of defense to the rear? Where is favorable ground
for an outpost lipe? Where are covered avenues of
withdrawal? Where is observation for supporting weapons?
Where are natural obstacles and terrain features
which can be converted into effective obstacles? Where
is terrain which permits long-range observation and firing?
6. TERRAIN FOR THE BIVOUA
Before the troops arrive, reconnoiter bivouac areas and
routes leading thereto . Avoid large assemblages of personnel
. The smaller the groups, the easier to conceal in
villages, wooded areas, or other suitable locations. Maintain
the tactical integrity of units in bivouac . If it is
necessary to bivouac by day in open terrain, increase the
distance and intervals to minimize the effect of hostile
bombing. For tactical purposes, bivouac requirements
include: Adequate room ; security and screening forces
which occupy commanding terrain and are sufficiently
strong to permit time and space for the main force to
maneuver according to the situation ; and routes connecting
the various groups and leading to potential defensive
areas. Bivouac requirements for troops demand dry
ground and land (preferably uncultivated) which is
lightly wooded, protected against wind, and convenient
to a supply of water, straw, and wood . The proximity
of villages is desirable .
Section IV. ON EALMENT
Troops must use every opportunity and means to deny
information to the enemy . Otherwise the essential element
in the attack, surprise, is lost . oncealment is
most effective when the enemy requires a long time to
discover that he has been deceived .
7. PROTE TION AGAINST GROUND RE ONNAISSAN
E
a . Hostile Observation
Hostile observers and staffs can see great distances
from high points (observation posts) with field glasses
and telescopes ; therefore, (a) when troop movements are
contemplated, study the map carefully to insure cover
against possible hostile observation ; (b) conceal movements,
positions, and installations by a screen of security
forces to the front and flanks .
b. Offensive oncealment
Security in all directions must be considered . oncealment
may be either offensive or defensive . If offensive,
cavalry and other highly mobile combat units are launched
against the hostile reconnaissance forces to drive then
back . This method is effective, but occasionally hostile
patrols are able to infiltrate or go around the attacking
force.
8 GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
c. Defensive oncealment
Defensive concealment is particularly effective when
the terrain contributes natural obstacles such as a river,
a chain of lakes, a swamp, or some similar area . The
stronger the natural obstacles, the weaker the force employed
to protect the avenues of approach, and also the
stronger the force that can be held as mobile reserve .
Reconnaissance units are sent far forward, operating
energetically and according to opportunity against the
hostile reconnaissance force .
d. False Appearances
In situations where it is desired to deceive the enemy
and impart the impression of great strength, circulate
false rumors, execute false marches, and send troops
against hostile reconnaissance forces with instructions to
fire a great deal of ammunition rapidly, to tie up the
hostile communications net, to disturb radio transmission,
and to organize deceptive transmission on radio or
wire .
8 . PROTE TION AGAINST AIR RE ONNAISSAN E
Strong activity on the part of the hostile air force
requires careful consideration for the concealment of
troops and installations, particularly when antiaircraft
means are lacking or very limited . The fact that photographs
reveal every detail must not be overlooked . Artificial
means of concealment, such as camouflage, smoke,
or nets, are effective ; but it is more important to survey
carefully the surrounding . area . Avoid constructions and
artificial works, sharp color contrasts, and lights . Realize,
on the other hand, that measures for concealment
ON EALMENT 9
hinder the troops, render more difficult, freedom of movement
and distribution of orders, and through night
marches and detours cause loss of time and decrease the
capacity to fight .
9 . ON EALMENT IN REST AREAS
Select rest areas in wooded locations or in several
villages . Place horses, tanks, vehicles, etc., under trees
or in stalls or courts, but avoid regular parking or paradeground
distribution . Regulate traffic in the area, keeping
the main roads and intersections free .
10. ON EALMENT OF TROOP MOVEMENTS
a . Loading and Unloading
In rail movements it is practically impossible to conceal
loading and unloading areas from hostile air reconnaissance
. When possible, march the troops by night to a
village near the loading station, permit them to rest, and
then move them on in smaller groups to the village where
the loading station is located . Load rapidly and vacate
the vicinity promptly .
b . Road Movements
In road movements, the concealment given by darkness
is most effective . Arrange the departure of troops front
bivouac at the beginning of darkness, with arrival in the
new area before daybreak . When marching by day,
select routes leading through woods, villages, or other
partially covered areas . The shadows of trees along
the roads offer excellent means for concealing columns,
including vehicles . Bride construction cannot be concealed,
but equipment can be so disposed prior to the
497725 * --42-3

actual construction that there is little or no tell-tale
indication of the preparations .
11 . ON EALMENT IN BATTLE
arry out development and deployment, or either,
under the concealment of darkness. If the situation
requires execution, by daylight, seek covered areas .
Utilize camouflage to conceal the positions of guns, of
headquarters, and of observation posts .
Section V. OMBAT INTELLIGEN E
The commander must continually, day and' night, conduct
reconnaissance and utilize intelligence iiic tns to
seek information clarifying the enemy situation . As soon
as possible, he will forward information and important
reports to the next higher commander, Once contact with
the enemy is gained, steps should be taken not to lose
contact. In higher commands, and sometimes with the
lower units, a special officer (intelligence officer) will be
detailed to handle all intelligence matters . Such an
officer works in coordination with all the commanders of
attached intelligence units and information services, and
keeps them constantly informed of the situation .
12. THE PREPARATION OF INTELLIGEN E REPORTS
Keep in mind the following rules governing the preparation
of reports : (a) Determine beforehand what reports
must be sent in code and also what means of signal
communications are to be used . (b) Differentiate bebetween
what one has personally seen and what another
has remarked or reported . (c) Avoid euphemistic phrases
and exaggerations . (d) State strength, time, and place
exactly. (e) Include information on the condition of the
terrain. (f) Send in pertinent information yourself,
never assuming that another unit has already sent it in .
(g) In eery urgent cases, send a report not only to the
next higher commander but also direct to the commander-
11
12
GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
in-chief. (h) From time to time, submit a complete
assembly of reports ; frequently a sketch will suffice .
13 . WHAT TO REPORT
In battle, utilize pauses to send in reports on enemy
movements, your own situation, the ammunition supply,
the condition of the terrain, and your own impressions .
Make suggestions for the seizing of . favorable opportunities.
Reports giving, such information as exists
just before , darkness sets in are especially valuable .
After a battle, report immediately what enemy troops
oppose your force, what the enemy is doing, what the
.condition of your own troops is, where your troops are
located, and what the status of the ammunition supply is .
14 . ONTA T AND OORDINATION, BETWEEN
FRIENDLY UNITS
Liaison between neighboring units, and between higher
and next lower units, is accomplished through a mutual
exchange of reports and a prompt communication of
friendly intentions . Large units utilize liaison officers
for this purpose, each unit sending one of its officers to
the other and holding him responsible for the exchange of
information, Such officers keep their commanders informed
of the situation with reference to the enemy, all
developments of the situation, and the intentions of the
other commander. The duties of a liasion officer demand
tactical knowledge, intelligence, and tact .
15. TRANSMISSION OF ORDERS AND REPORTS
Several communication means should always be available
to a commander . Where technical communication
OMBAT 12NTELLIGEN E
means are uncertain or cannot be maintained, then
courier service I is established . Very important orders
or reports are generally sent by officer messengers in
motorcycles or cars . If delivery is uncertain, several
means of transmission are used, as well as different routes,
to insure the prompt arrival of the information at its
destination.
Every commander is required to know the routes of
communication and the messenger route . All units assist
in the uninterrupted transmission of reports and messages .
Higher commanders and commanders of reconnaissance
and security units are authorized to examine the messages
which they contact en route, noting on the message that
they have done so, the hour, and the date .
16. ADVAN E MESSAGE ENTERS
To expedite the receipt of information, advance message
centers are established, particularly in the area or sector
where communications will be numerous . Such message
centers should be easily located, protected from hostile
fire, and definitely connected with the rearward message
center . Under certain circumstances (for example, on the
front of a cavalry corps), advance message centers and
message assembly points may be established at considerable
distances from the main headquarters, in order to
simplify and expedite the transmission of information
between the reconnaissance units and the main headquarters
.

OFaRMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
17. INFORMATION THROUGH SPE IAL MEANS
The air intelligence service observes hostile air activity
and provides information relative to the air situation, and
from this one can obtain a fairly accurate conception of
the enemy's intentions . The signal communication intelligence
service observes all hostile communications
(radio, telephones' telegraph, etc .) through goniometric
intercept, listening posts, wire tapping, observers, and
other means . The routine interrogation of prisoners of
war yields miscellaneous information . aptured documents
may include orders, maps, messages, notebooks,
newspapers, photographs, and films . Scrutiny of the
hostile press and publications is maintained .
18. IMPORTANT PRIN IPLES OF RE ONNAISSAN E
Do not dissipate reconnaissance strength . Superiority
of means is very important for successful reconnaissance :
but superiority in mobility and clever employment tend
to offset numerical inferiority . It will frequently be
necessary to fight for information . Advanced hostile
security and reconnaissance forces must be penetrated
or thrown back to make contact possible with the hostile
main force . In this connection, it is often advisable to
occupy important points quickly with motorized forces .
When there is great inferiority to the enemy, fighting
should be avoided, and an endeavor should be made to
penetrate the enemy screen or go around it .
The commander who specifies what information is to
be obtained should coordinate all his subordinate reconnaissance
means . Efficient reconnaissance is not obtained
through employment of large numbers of recon-
OMBAT INTELLIGEN E
15
noitering units, but by the careful direction and instruction
of these units as to what the commander wishes to
know . Definite missions and their relative urgency must
be indicated, and the means of sending information to
the rear, including definitely regulated radio traffic,
must be insured .
19. STRATEGI RE ONNAISSAN E
Strategic, or operative, reconnaissance endeavors to
build up a general picture of the overall situation, thus
aiding the commander . in chief in making the decisions
which have important influence on the entire campaign .
Missions may include observation of hostile mobilizations,
assemblies, initial march directions, railroad movements,
boat movements, supply echelons, construction of
fortifications, air activities, locations, strengths, movements
of motorized and mechanized forces, and, particularly,
open flanks . Such missions are performed by
air reconnaissance units, motorized reconnaissance battalions,
and army cavalry units. The three must supplement
each other and be carefully coordinated to that end .
20. TA TI AL RE ONNAISSAN E
Tactical reconnaissance is concerned with the movements
of the enemy in closer proximity : his movements,
bivouac areas, organization, breadth and depth of disposition,
supply service, construction of defensive works, air
activity, and location of airfields and antiaircraft . Especially
important is timely report of the location of
motorized or mechanized forces .
For air reconnaissance, the commander utilizes the airplane
squadron which is placed at his disposal for such
J6
QEEMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
purpose by tllle air force . For ground reconnaissance, he
utilizes independent motorized reconnaissance battalions,
motorized reconnaissance battalions of the cavalry,
mounted reconnaissance' battalions of the cavalry, and
reconnaissance battalions of the infantry divisions .
21 . RE ONNAISSAN E BATTALIONS
Definite sectors are generally assigned to reconnaissance
battalions . Within the corps, boundaries between divisions
are designated, and on open flanks the boundary is
designated between the flank reconnaissance area of the
division 'and that of the corps . Reconnaissance units
avoid fighting , unless it is absolutely required by the
situation in the accomplishment of their missions . If a
reconnaissance unit be given a security mission, the unit
should be reinforced by others units : for example, by
machine gun, light artillery, antitank, and engineer troops .
If a reconnaissance battalion is directly in front of the
division and in contact with the enemy, it should be
ordered either : (a) to move off to a side and continue
reconnaissance in that area, or (b) to await relief from
troops coming up from the rear, or (c) to fall back upon
the troops in the rear . In the absence of any orders,
under the aforesaid circumstances the reconnaissance
battalion should fall back upon the troops in the rear .
On an open flank, reconnaissance battalions are echeloned
forward.
22. MOTORIZED RE ONNAISSAN E BATTALIONS
The important advantage is speed . Motorized reconnaissance
battalions can reconnoiter by day and march
on by night, and are restricted only by limitations of the
eOM15A'r 1N'TELL1OEN E 17
motor vehicles, terrain, weather, roads, fuel supply, and
signal communication . They maintain connection with
mounted reconnaissance units by radio . Advancing forward
by bounds-the nearer the enemy, the shorter the
bounds--they remain as long as possible on roads . In
hostile territory, different routes for the return are
selected, and important points along the road, or important
places, are secured . Rest during the night is
obtained by avoiding main roads and villages, and by
halting under available cover in isolated areas . ontact
with the enemy, however, must be maintained .
The width of a sector should not be over 50 kilometers
(31 miles) . The depth is limited by fuel supply . Motor
vehicles in modern reconnaissance units have a radius
of action of between 200 to 250 kilometers (125 to 155
miles) without replenishment .
Scouting groups will generally be organized and dispatched
by the commander of a battalion . Such groups
include armored scout cars, motorcycles, and radio
equipment. Along the more important roads and those
leading to the decisive areas or points, patrols should he
stronger, but too large a patrol increases the difficulty of
concealment from the enemy . Armored car patrols
within scouting groups will be, given written orders pertaining
to route, destination, and information desired

"kes was already under
consideration at Army Headquarters, where Crerar had begun discussions with
Montgomerys Chief of Staff, Major-General Francis de Guingand, and Admiral
Bertram Ramsay, the Allied Naval Commander-in-Chief. Ramsay backed the plan
to bomb the dykes, as it would improve the prospects of an amphibious attack by
creating a breach through which landing craft might pass. Ramsay insisted that
the Royal Navy take over responsibility for any waterborne assault on Walcheren,
and he nominated Captain A.F. Pugsley to oversee the arrangements. He also
noted that HMS Warspite and the monitors Erebus and Roberts would be available
to support a landing. General de Guingand agreed to obtain the views of higher
authority on the political dimension of flooding a Dutch island.2
Two days later Crerar, Pugsley and a representative from Bomber
Command met to consider the plan. They agreed that the commandos of 4th
Special Service Brigade would be used in a seaborne landing, allowing Simonds
to deploy all of 3rd Division to clearing the Breskens Pocket.3 Despite a report
from Crerars Chief Engineer, Brigadier G. Walsh, who doubted the dykes could
be breached by bombing and insisted that, even if the whole island was flooded,
the channels created would be too shallow for landing craft, Ramsay and Simonds
continued to advocate breaching the dykes. On 1 October 1944 General
Eisenhower, apparently without consulting the Dutch government, approved the
project.4 The next day Harry Crerar, who had been coping with a severe stomach
ailment, entered hospital, handing over command of the Army to Guy Simonds.
The senior divisional commander, Charles Foulkes, became Acting Corps
Commander, though in practice Simonds continued to exercise command at the
operational level.
While these high level discussions were underway, Simonds prepared
preliminary instructions for Operation SWITCHBACK, the plan to clear the
area north of the Leopold Canal. On 30 September the Acting Corps Commander
issued a draft outline plan closely based on these instructions. Foulkes sketched a
two-phase operation, to establish a bridgehead and then clear the Knocke-sur-
Mer fortress area. Third Division was to break into the pocket in two places
across the Leopold Canal and across the Savojaards Plaat. Both attacks were to
begin on 6 October less than a week away.5 This deadline meant that 9th Brigade,
selected to carry out the amphibious assault on the northeast corner of the pocket,
would have little time for training.
The outline plan did not include paragraphs on the enemy, presumably
because intelligence officers were still analysing the available information. Little
is known about the use of Ultra by First Canadian Army, but Crerar and, after
26 September, Simonds were among the select group of senior officers on the
Ultra recipients list.6 In addition, Brigadier Church Mann, the Chief of Staff,
Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Wright, the senior intelligence officer, and five other
senior staff officers had access to this special intelligence without a detailed
knowledge of its origins.7 None of the other officers at army or corps were aware
that the small group of specialists known as the Signals Liaison Unit, or SLU,
were providing the army commander with decrypts of the enemys most secret
communications8 including Hitlers orders to defend Walcheren Island and the
Breskens area to the last man.9
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
96
Acting Army Commander
Ultra provided little assistance when it came to questions of enemy
strengths and dispositions at the divisional level, so much depended on photoreconnaissance
and patrol reports. Evidence from these sources confirmed that
the enemy held the area in strength with mortar targets registered to within feet
and defensive belts of machine gun fire that would sweep the dyke tops at about
eight inches height. It was also evident that the 1037th Grenadier Regiment of
64th Infantry Division, responsible for the defence of the eastern end of the
pocket, was a well-trained force of high quality troops.10
Allied intelligence reported that 64th Division had been created in the
summer of 1944 from cadres of veteran officers and men on leave from the
Eastern Front. The rest of the division was filled with whoever was available and
it was thought that their quality varied widely. Senior German officers were
confident that the division could carry out its orders to provide an obstinate
defence of the Breskens Pocket. The army commander described the 64th as the
only division in his army still maintaining its full fighting power both as to
strength and equipment. General Knut Eberding, an experienced infantry officer,
and his regimental commanders were regarded as dedicated and effective leaders.11
Major-General Dan Spry and his staff had very little time to prepare for
Operation SWITCHBACK and 7th Brigade, selected for the assault crossing of
the Leopold, did not issue an operational order until 5 October, less than 24 hours
before the attack was to begin. Brigadier Jock Spragge held a final co-ordinating
conference at 1800 hours that day to confirm timings and arrangements. Simonds
plan required the Regina Rifles and Canscots to assault and seize crossing over
Leopold Canal in the area Moershoofd to the Aardenburg. The brigade was then
to enlarge the bridgehead and in Phase 3 mop up in west direction before
advancing to Oostburg and Schoondijke. Divisional engineers were to construct
two Kapok footbridges and two road bridges as soon as the crossing is secured.12
The divisional plan called for 8th Brigade to enter the bridgehead after Phase 3
was complete, to clear the area as far west as the Sluis Canal while 9th Brigade
advanced from its northeast bridgehead to Hoofdplaat and Breskens.13
Did Simonds actually believe that a single infantry brigade without
armoured support could cross a canal, overcome large enemy forces in well
prepared defences, advance beyond flooded and saturated ground along a single
elevated road and then clear and defend a 10 kilometre wide bridgehead? Surely
not. The plan provided brigade commanders with an outline of how they were to
proceed in the unlikely event of an enemy collapse or staged withdrawal. The
crossing itself, never mind the establishment of the shallow Phase 2 bridgehead,
presented a major challenge that required elaborate and continuous support.
97
Considering the limited time available the preparations for
SWITCHBACK were an impressive example of the flexibility and
professionalism of the Canadian Army. There was, however, one major problem
left to deal with. Simonds original concept of operations called for both the attack
across the Leopold and the amphibious assault to begin on 6 October, forcing the
enemy to fight on two fronts. The delay in completing operations at Calais and
Cap Gris Nez meant that 9th Brigade did not begin training with 5th Assault
Regiment until 5 October, and it quickly became evident that the men and
equipment for the amphibious assault could not be in position before the evening
of 7 October. H-Hour for 9th Brigade was therefore set for 0130 hours on 8
October.14
It was now up to Simonds to decide whether to postpone 7th Brigades
attack or allow it to begin as scheduled. In the absence of written records it is not
possible to determine their reasons for committing 7th Brigade to an action that
would leave the assaulting battalions on their own for at least 48 hours, but there
is no doubt that Simonds understood the consequences. The enemy had placed all
three of his grenadier regiments along the canal with local reserves positioned to
counterattack. The area selected for the crossing, a long, narrow triangle bounded
by flooded or saturated polders, was a carefully prepared killing ground with preregistered
mortar and artillery targets and well-camouflaged machine gun posts
with interlocking arcs of fire. From the perspective of the senior commanders, the
attack, however costly, would focus the enemys attention on the canal, and greatly
improve the prospects for 9th Brigades risky amphibious landing.
General Knut Eberding conducted the defence of the Breskens Pocket
according to German army doctrine ordering regimental and then divisional
reserves to counter-attack and force the Canadians to withdraw. The CRA,
Brigadier Todd had prepared for this familiar response and he provided the 7th
Brigade with a system of Grouped Stonks and Concs on call (linear and
pinpoint) that included 46 likely targets; roads, hamlets, woods and tree lines, each
coded with the name of a river. Forward Observation Officers, one per company,
could call down fire on any of these targets with a single word as could company,
platoon or section commanders. The pre-determined target could also be used as
a reference point for observed fire during enemy counter-attacks. Todd retained
control of counter-battery and defensive fire tasks but otherwise the use of the
guns rested with the infantry who were given neutralizing fire when they want it
for as long as they want it.15
General Eberding was so confident that his division had dealt with the
attacks at the Leopold that he reported that the eastern bridgehead had been sealed
off and the western one eliminated.16 The Reginas were certainly pinned down
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
98
Acting Army Commander
and unable to advance, but eliminating them was another matter. Shortly after
darkness fell, the enemy formed up to begin a major attack. This was the moment
the artillery had been longing for, as the enemy were conveniently grouped around
Skeena, one of the pre-arranged medium regiment targets. With this kind of
support the Reginas were able to report that everything was under control.17
This was the first of a series of counter-attacks carried out by 1038th
Regiment reinforced by Eberdings divisional reserve, 1st Para Training Regiment
and a battle group from 1037th Regiment. The immediate result of this
commitment of the best available reserves was a stalemate with neither side able
to gain further advantage.18 The more serious consequences only became apparent
when an armada of Buffaloes emerged from the waters of the Scheldt in the early
morning hours of 9 October to open the back door of the Breskens Pocket. This
assault, described by the German high command as a decision-seeking attack on
the Breskens bridgehead, caught Eberding without any reserves other than two
companies ferried over from Walcheren.19 Eberding was to tell interrogators that
he had considered the possibility of an attack across the Braakman Inlet but
assumed it could only be on a small scale. He believed that the 627th
Landeschutzen Battalion, a force of some 300 combat troops, with headquarters at
Biervliet, would be able to deal with such attacks. Eberding was unable to
imagine the possibility of a large amphibious landing on the north coast of the
pocket, as he had no knowledge of the existence of a regiment of amphibious
vehicles.20
Eberdings decision to employ his reserves to try and wipe out the
Leopold bridgehead allowed 9th Brigade to carry out a complex and dangerous
amphibious attack, and to establish a large beachhead before the enemy could
react. Combat officers were also surprised by the enemys determination to
overwhelm 7th Brigade. Major A.L. Gollnich, the 2 i/c of the Reginas, spoke for
many when he told an historical officer that:
If the enemy had chosen to adopt a purely defensive role and had
withdrawn more slowly all the way to the sea, our casualties
would ultimately have been much heavier. Instead he elected to
launch many expensive counterattacks, which harsh though our
troops found them, eventually weakened him seriously.
Gollnich believed that the enemy had unquestionably spent his best
troops in costly counter-attacks designed to crush the small but stubborn
bridgehead leaving the defence of the rest of the pocket to men of a very inferior
sort, many of them odds and sods of poor physical condition.21 By 15 October
the outcome of the battle for the Breskens Pocket was no longer in doubt. The
99
German High Command (OKW) reported that the situation would soon be
irreversible unless reinforcements were sent to bolster 64th Division.
While 3rd Division fought to clear the Breskens Pocket, Simonds dealt
with the problem of freeing the north coast of the Scheldt Estuary. Despite
Montgomerys decision to use I British Corps to support attempts to widen the
Nijmegen-Arnhem salient, created during Operation MARKET GARDEN,
Simonds was determined to begin the advance north from Antwerp to South
Beveland. On 2 October he issued his first directive as Acting Army
Commander.22
Simonds had anticipated a strong enemy reaction to 2nd Divisions
advance and on 7 October General Gustav Von Zangen, commanding 15th Army
ordered his army reserve Battle Group Chill to Woensdrecht to block the
Canadian advance. The defence of the approaches to Antwerp, he declared,
represents a task which is decisive for the further conduct of the war.
Lieutenant-General Erich Diestel, who was commanding the mixed bag of
divisional fragments defending the area north of Antwerp, described the arrival of
the reinforcements when he was interviewed in 1945:
On October 2nd the Canadians attacked north from Merxem and
in three days had driven the divisions right flank from back to
Putte, a distance of some 7 kms... There was no regular line to
hold at this time, but rather a series of tactical points... The
division had lost over 800 men in the battle for the Turnhout and
Albert Canals and was in a very tired state. About 7 October, in
almost melodramatic-fashion, aid came in the form of the
15 Army Assault Battalion consisting of about 1000 men from the
Army Battle School and the von der Heydte Parachute Regiment
of about 2500 fanatical and eager young parachutists.23
Fifteenth Army was able to move its reserve to the Antwerp sector
because Montgomery decided to postpone the advance to the Rhur until 2nd Army
was re-organized. I British Corps, reinforced by 51st Highland Division, took
over the defence of the western side of the salient and called off attempts to reach
Tilburg and S-Hertogenbosch. Montgomery realized that this would leave 2nd
Canadian Division on its own with an exposed right flank, but for Montgomery
the Scheldt was still not a priority. Aware of the growing criticism of his strategy
he told Brooke on 7 October, Canadian troops were astride the road leading
westwards from the mainland to South Beveland. He also claimed to have
examined carefully the whole situation of the opening up of Antwerp with a view
to speeding up the matter and it is clear we are using all the troops we can
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
100
Acting Army Commander
successfully employ.24 Montgomery could not possibly have believed either
statement, but he was determined to buy time for one more attempt to reach the
Rhine.
Dutch civilians and air reconnaissance had provided fairly detailed
information on the arrival of major German reinforcements and both division and
corps intelligence accepted an estimate of between 2,000 and 3,000 troops.
Brigadier Keefler reacted to this information by ordering 4th and 5th Brigades to
go over to the defensive and prepare for a major attack which the army
intelligence section, probably on the basis of Ultra decrypts, had predicted for the
night of 8 October.25
By mid-day on 10 October the German counterattack seemed to be spent.
Von der Heydtes Regiment had suffered heavy casualties, estimated at 480 men,
in addition to more than 50 prisoners of war.26 Much is made in the secondary
literature of the skill of the German officer corps and the fighting power of
German paratroopers, but the battle for Hoogerheide demonstrated major
deficiencies in German doctrine and tactics, a situation not uncommon in
Northwest Europe. Von der Heydte had launched a frontal attack against forces
that had gone over to the defensive. He persisted in pressing forward despite
heavy losses. To attack in this manner, when reconnaissance would have shown
the weakness of the Canadian right flank, suggests overconfidence and doctrinal
rigidity.
On 9 October Field Marshal Montgomery had issued a directive, which
again emphasized offensive action by Second British Army in the Nijmegen
sector. First Canadian Army was told to use all available resources on the
operations designed to give us free use of the port of Antwerp. Montgomery did
promise reinforcements. The 104th U.S. (Timberwolf) and the 52nd (Lowland)
British Division would both be allocated to Simonds, but neither would be
available for at least ten days.
When Eisenhower received a copy of Montgomerys directive, he had on
his desk a report from Admiral Bertram Ramsay, which criticized the pace of
operations to clear the Scheldt and noted that the Canadians were being
handicapped by an ammunition shortage. Eisenhower, increasingly unhappy with
Montgomerys conduct of operations, used this information in a message to Monty
which concluded, I must emphasize that of all our operations on our entire front
from Switzerland to the Channel, I consider Antwerp of first importance and I
believe that the operations to clear up the entrance require your personal
attention. Montgomery was furious at this reprimand, accusing Ramsay of wild
statements and denying there was an ammunition shortage. The Field Marshal
101
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
102
also insisted that Eisenhower had agreed to his policy of making the main effort
against the Ruhr.27 The most important immediate effect of this high-level
confrontation was to put enormous pressure on the two Canadian infantry
divisions. On the night of 9 October, 2nd Division was informed, the limit to
artillery ammunition expenditure (which Monty had denied existed) has been
removed.28 The battle was to be continued with new intensity, as the infantry
battalions would soon discover.
The strategic debate between Montgomery and Eisenhower was
temporarily settled on 16 October when Montgomery outlined revised plans for
21 Army Group. The use of the Port of Antwerp was to have complete
priority, with the whole offensive power of Second British Army as well as
First Canadian Army available. This translated into plans to release I British
Corps from its responsibilities in the east, with its full weight pulled over towards
Antwerp. The Corps was, however, to transfer 7th Armoured Division, 51st
Highland Division and 34th Armoured Brigade to Second Army,29 leaving Crocker
with just one infantry and one armoured division until the 104th U.S. Infantry
Division was available. Thus, while it is true that once the new orders took effect
the situation north of Antwerp was transformed30 eight days were to pass before
the enemy was forced to abandon Woensdrecht. It is also important to note that
the whole offensive power of Second British Army amounted to a very limited
advance by 12th British Corps, which did not begin until 22 October.31
While his attention was briefly focused on Antwerp, Montgomery lashed
out at Ramsay, demanding that he cease dealing directly with Simonds on
operational matters. Ramsay, who was not the least bit intimidated by
Montgomery, replied that he had been dealing directly with First Canadian Army
in all matters concerning Infatuate in view of your apparent reluctance to concern
yourself Montgomery promptly backed down and Ramsay continued to deal
directly with Simonds.32
Montgomerys 16 October Directive offered Guy Simonds the first
opportunity to command a two-corps army since his appointment as acting army
commander. He decided to reinforce Crocker with 4th Canadian Armoured
Division and start Operation SUITCASE, the advance to Breda, Roosendaal and
Bergen-op-Zoom, without waiting for the promised American division. Plans for
Operation INFATUATE I and II, the amphibious assaults on Walcheren, were now
complete, with 1 November as the target date. To ensure the success of the risky
assault landings, Simonds was determined to distract the enemy by launching an
attack on the island from the east, and he outlined plans for a new operation codenamed
VITALITY. VITALITY I involved the advance of 2nd Canadian Division
into South Beveland, while VITALITY II was an amphibious attack on the
Acting Army Commander
103
southeast corner of the Beveland peninsula, designed to outflank the German
defences by landing behind the South Beveland canal.33 Simonds also decided to
revive the Armys long standing request for support from First Allied Airborne
Army, proposing that one para bde drop west of Zuid Beveland related in time to
seaborne crossing West Schelde and landward thrust west34 The Airborne
commanders saw no reason to change their earlier appreciation that terrain
characteristics ruled out the use of paratroops, a view Simonds did not share.
The five operations planned and executed by First Canadian Army in late
October and early November 1944 placed an extraordinary burden on army, corps
and divisional staff officers as well as the combat troops. Shortages of
ammunition and fuel still plagued the Army, which was dependent on Dieppe and
Ostend for supplies. The enemy was fighting hardstubbornly contesting one
position after another, and was evidently determined to delay our capture of the
Scheldt Estuary at all costs,35 so Simonds hoped to destroy their will to resist by
a series of carefully timed manoeuvres.
I British Corps long delayed advance could not begin until 4th Armoured
Division was fully concentrated, so Operation SUITCASE was scheduled for
20 October. The corps commander decided that 4th Armoured Division would
lead, advancing two brigades up, to seize a crossing of the Roosendaal Canal
and then secure the town of Esschen. The 49th Division was to conform on the
right and take over Esschen should 4th Canadian Armoured Division push
further north.36 This action forced the enemy to withdraw from the Hoogerheide-
Woensdrecht area, allowing 2nd Division to move west.
The primary purpose of the I Corps advance, to enable us to operate
freely westwards along the Beveland isthmus, had been accomplished by
24 October and Montgomery was again turning his attention to the Ruhr. On
25 October he arrived at Crockers Corps Headquarters and then visited each
division to urge all possible speed in pressing the enemy back to the Maas.37 With
the Polish Armoured Division joining in the advance, Crocker would have four
divisions available to pursue the enemy. The plan to trap the Germans south of
the river by using the whole offensive power of Second British Army in a
strong thrust westwards was thus abandoned two days before an attack from the
eastern side of the Nijmegen salient forced Dempsey to return units to 8 Corps and
limit advances west of SHertengobosch.38 Crockers divisions were ordered to
drive ahead for Moerdijke and the Maas, an advance that continued until
7 November when the last elements of 15th Army crossed the Maas and blew the
Moerdijke bridges.39
With the route into South Beveland open Operation VITALITY I began on
the morning of 24 October. Attempts to accelerate the advance were prevented by
water, mud, mines and several surviving anti-tank guns controlling the railwayroad
embankment, the only passable route across the narrowest part of the
isthmus. To outflank the enemy, the infantry had to wade across flooded polders
in a cold, continuous rain. All three battalions of 4th Brigade were committed to
the battle and by mid-day on 25 October some progress had been made.
From Simonds perspective this exhausting battle was going according to
plan, for at 0245 hours on 26 October, Operation VITALITY II began with a
flotilla of landing craft from Terneuzen reaching the south side of the peninsula
behind the canal defences. The task had been assigned to 156th Brigade of 52nd
(Lowland) Division and the Scottish soldiers found the steep and slippery dykes a
greater obstacle than the enemy. The terrain and the limited number of available
Buffaloes slowed the expansion of the bridgehead, but by first light on 27 October
the 4/5th Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers had broken the back of the German
resistance, capturing more than 100 prisoners and severely punishing the
enemys counter-attacks.40 The success of VITALITY II was soon measured by
the collapse of the enemy resistance at the Beveland Canal. Brigadier J.C.
Gauvreaus 6th Brigade was able to cross on the afternoon of 27 October, and the
engineers had bridges in place the next morning.
After the Beveland Canal defences were breached, the road network
allowed 2nd Division to send two brigades forward. Some veterans of the
campaign, as well as the official historian, have maintained that to encourage
rapid advance, the acting division commander promised that the brigade
reaching the area first would hold the near end of the causeway; the other would
push across it and form a bridgehead.41 Versions of this story may have circulated
in November, but there was no race to the causeway. The specific tasks and
objectives of each brigade are spelled out in the war diaries, message logs and
operational orders. As might be expected, the divisional plan called for the
advance to be made in a series of bounds, with 4th Brigade leading off into the
peninsula and 6th Brigade seizing the bridgehead across the Beveland Canal.
Fifth Brigades war diary for 29 October notes, Our job has not changedwe are
still to go as fast as possible for the causeway. 4th Brigade are pushing out to the
west on our left flank and established contact with 157th Brigade during the day.42
At 0930 hours on the morning of 31 October, Simonds decided to go
ahead with the amphibious attacks on Walcheren Island. Foulkes immediately
sent to 2nd Division headquarters a signal that read, No interference on
Walcheren by guns or air. Most desirable we get on with it.43 The hazardous
amphibious attacks on Flushing and Westkapelle were scheduled for dawn the
next morning, and it was important to persuade the enemy that the attack would
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
104
Acting Army Commander
come from the Beveland area. Foulkes ordered 5th Brigade to begin the operation
by seizing a bridgehead on Walcheren, which could then be turned over to the
Scots.44
The causeway diversion was badly needed. The plans for Operation
INFATUATE, the clearing of Walcheren Island, made enormous demands upon
the assault troops and naval flotillas. The risks taken could only be justified by
the urgency of the need to open the port of Antwerp. The attack on Flushing,
carried out with limited air support,45 required 4th Commando, the unit originally
raised by Lord Lovat that had fought with distinction at Dieppe, to cross the
Scheldt from Breskens in assault landing crafts (LCAs). They were to seize the
harbour as a base for 155th Brigade, which was to pass through and clear the
partially flooded streets of the town. The assault on Flushing was challenging
enough for anyone, but its difficulties paled in comparison to those faced by Force
T at Westkapelle. The 182 ships involved in this action left Ostend just after
midnight on 31 October. Simonds and Ramsay allowed the force commanders to
decide if the operation was feasible when they reached the island.
At 0600 hours 1 November Simonds signalled, in clear, that it was
extremely unlikely any air support, air spotting or air smoke owing to airfield
conditions and forecast. Despite this, the naval force commander Rear Admiral
A.F. Pugsley decided to go ahead with the operation and at 0820 hours the heavy
support squadron, HMS Warspite and the monitors HMS Erebus and Roberts
opened fire. The close support squadron, made up of 27 vessels with fire power
ranging from rockets to 17-pounder anti-tank guns, drew most of the enemy fire,
permitting the assault craft to pass through the breach in the dyke. Nine support
ships were lost and eleven badly damaged, but the Commandos were landed and
able to begin a three-day battle for the coastal guns.46
The post-mortems on Operation INFATUATE began almost immediately.
The heavy casualties suffered by the navy prompted Rear Admiral Pugsley to
protest the limited commitment of Bomber Command and the failure to silence
any of the Walcheren gun batteries. Pugsley, with Admiral Ramsays support, also
complained that No proper joint plan was ever produced, because the RAF
remained the sole judges of what air support could be provided. General Simonds
wrote a detailed reply to this report (reproduced at the end of this chapter),
agreeing with many of Pugsleys comments on the RAF, but insisting a successful
joint naval and army plan based upon the tasks and outline which had been given
to them was produced by the force commanders responsible for the operation.47
Simonds concluded his reply with the comment:
It would be my wish that the operations could have succeeded
105
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
106
Acting Army Commander
107
with much lighter naval casualties, but to keep things in
perspective I must point out that these were a mere fraction of the
casualties suffered by the army formations involved in the
operations for clearing the Scheldt Estuary.
The Canadian share of those army casualties, more than 90 percent of the
total, included 1,418 men killed in action and 4,949 wounded.48

security detachments
â¢ 737 The antiaircraft artillery is disposed to protect the
most vital points on the routes of the retiring columns As
the retirement progresses the antiaircraft artillery moves
rapidly by bounds from area to area and frequently is given
priority on the roads
â¢ 738 During a retirement cavalry is employed on security
missions and frequently may constitute or be attached to the
rear or flank guards Reconnaissance particularly to obtain
information of any hostile movement directed toward the
flanks is important and is assigned to the cavalry or to the
security detachment controlling the cavalry
â¢ 739 Observation aviation must keep under observation any
hostile forces that are in position to interfere with the retirement
especially on the flanks It should maintain close
liaison with the security detachments Airplanes usually
are placed at the disposal of the artillery with rear guards to
observe their long-range fires
Combat aviation is employed to delay the hostile pursuit
Its action is coordinated with that of the security detachments
â¢ 740 Engineers accompany or precede the main columns to
facilitate their movement Suitable detachments are attached
to rear and flank guards to assist in delaying the
enemy Some engineers may be employed in certain situations
to reconnoiter and stake out rear defensive positions

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
74 A retirement generally offers opportunities for the
use of chemicals of all kinds Smoke may assist security detachments
in concealing their movements during successive
withdrawals
â¢ 742 In retirement orders present command posts and the
next ones to be occupied should be specified Axes of signal
communication should be indicated as far to the rear as it
is practicable to foresee them
SECURITY DURING RETIREMENT
â¢ 743 All-around security must be provided In a short retirement
which can be completed in one night the covering
force for the withdrawal usually gives sufficient protection for
the movement (See par 7 6 ) If the movement continues
after daylight a rear guard normally should be
formed to protect the march of the main bodies Initially
this rear guard consists of the troops which covered the assembly
of the main body reinforced by contingents of other
arms as required by the situation
744 The mission of the rear guard is to protect the main
body from surprise harassment and attack By the successful
execution of this mission a rear guard covering a retirement
enables the main body to avoid accepting battle and
regains for the commander of the force his freedom of action
The strength and composition of a rear guard are such as
to permit the execution of its mission without the intervention
of the main body When necessary for the security
of the main body the rear guard sacrifices itself in the
execution of its mission
0 745 A rear guard covering the retirement of a combined
force consists principally of infantry strong in automatic
weapons supported by artillery Units of other arms are
added in accordance with the requirements of the situation
Antitank weapons mechanized units signal troops chemical
troops and engineers may be included
The ability of cavalry to conduct delaying action makes it
an important element of a rear guard When the main body
has succeeded in gaining sufficient distance from the enemy
cavalry may constitute the principal element of the rear
guard
74
OPERATIONS
746-749
â¢ 746 The formation and the method of operation of the
rear guard are adapted to the situation Movement to the
rear is made by bounds based on the progress of the main
body and the time limit set by the higher commander for
holding designated terrain lines The distance between the
rear guard and the main body is determined accordingly
Delays fn the retirement of the main body must be expected
â¢ 747 When in contact with the enemy the rear guard distributes
its forces in groups over a wide front and opens long
range fire with its artillery and other supporting weapons to
force the enemy to deploy and thus to delay his advance
Unless the security of the main body requires a stubborn
resistance the rear guard as far as practicable avoids close
range combat and withdraws successively from position to
position as the enemy approaches
The successive positions of the rear guard are chosen at
such distance from each other that the enemy is forced to
renew his preparations for attack in front of each of them
and that changes of position by the artillery of the rear
guard are reduced to a minimum A rear guard position
should favor withdrawal by affording covered routes
â¢ 748 When the enemy presses his pursuit closely greater
resistance is offered Advantage is taken of favorable opportunities
to punish overhasty pursuit by counterattack Attack
against the flanks of pursuing columns by mechanized
troops or cavalry is an effective means of disorganizing the
pursuit The most favorable time for offering a determined
resistance is during the late hours of the day to permit withdrawal
of the rear guard under cover of darkness
â¢ 749 When the distance from the enemy permits the rear
guard retires in march formation Its distribution corresponds
in general to that of an advance guard and in
reverse order of march comprising the reserve the support
and the rear guard cavalry or motorized detachment The
support provides a rear party and necessary flank patrols
Because of the direction of march infantry reconnaissance
during the retirement is much more restricted than in case
of an advance guard Chief reliance for the execution of the
necessary reconnaissances must be placed upon cavalry mechanized
units and observation aviation Mobile troops especially
observe and forestall attempts to pass the flanks of the
rear guard
75
750-753
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â 750 When there is likelihood of attack by mobile troops
against the heads of the retreating columns advance guards
are detailed They are composed of mobile troops reinforced
by antitank and engineer detachments If there is no threat
against the heads of the columns the principal missions of
the advance guard will be to clear routes of march insure the)
uninterrupted movement of the main body and regulate civilian
and refugee traffic For the latter purpose military
police are attached
75 Flank security is of especial importance during a retirement
When there is danger of an encircling maneuver
in pursuit flank guards composed of mobile troops with
engineer antitank and chemical units attached are detailed
to cover the exposed flank When opposed by an
enemy strong in mechanized and air forces special attention
must be paid to the security of the routes of retirement and
the area or position to which the troops are retiring Under
such conditions it will normally be necessary to employ forces
other than those retiring to occupy and organize the rear
position before it is reached by the retiring forces When
conditions permit the rear position is organized behind
strong natural obstacles
DELAYING ACTION
5 752 Recourse to delaying action ordinarily implies either
lack of readiness for battle or hostile superiority of force
Its purpose is to gain time while avoiding decisive action
Delaying action may be used in the opening phases of
battle to gain time for the unified employment of the entire
command It may also be called for in later phases pending
completion of preparations for counteroffensive action It
finds especial application in the operations of covering forces
and other security detachments
In offensive operations delaying action by a portion of
the command to delay the arrival of hostile reinforcements
may be of decisive importance
753 Delay of an advancing enemy may be accomplished
by offensive action by defensive action in one position by
delaying action in successive positions or by any combination
of these methods
76
OPERATIONS
754-756
754 Skillful use of terrain has a decided influence on all
delaying operations A series of parallel ridges across the
lines of hostile advance; unfordable streams swamps lakes
and other obstacles on the front and flanks ; high ground with
good observation and good fields of fire at long range ; congealed
routes of withdrawal immediately behind delaying
positions ; and a good road net all favor the execution of
delaying action
Â® 755 In situations where the enemy has freedom of maneuver
and mobile troops and the flanks of a delaying force
are open to hostile attack the protection of the flanks and
rear is of vital importance Since the enemy may succeed
in pushing by the flanks or in executing a wider maneuver
with mobile forces to strike in rear of an occupied delaying
position the commander must make provision to block or
destroy such forces
Ground and aerial reconnaissance forces must be continuously
on the alert to locate such threats to flanks and
rear
â 756 Delaying action in successive positions is based on
limited resistance on a position with the intention of renewing
this resistance in successive positions if necessary The
defense on each position must force the enemy to early
deployment and to time-consuming preparations for battle
Combat ordinarily is broken off in each position before troops
become closely engaged The situation may however require
a strong resistance on some position or even a counterattack
in order to accomplish the delaying mission
The delaying measures are continued between positions in
order to gain time for organizing resistance on the next position
Because of the retrograde and long range nature of
such combat delaying action is executed most effectively by
troops possessing a high degree of mobility and great fire
power especially at longer ranges
In general contact is made as far forward as possible and
continuous light resistance is offered in order to compel the
enemy to employ his whole force and to consume a maximum
of time No more ground than necessary is given up The
ability to execute planned withdrawals under conditions that
permit orderly movement to the rear must however be
retained
77
757-760
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â¢ 757 In open terrain the important consideration in the
selection of a delaying position is a good field of fire at long
range Field of fire at close range is of less importance In
close and wooded terrain observation and field of fire are
equally unfavorable for both sides ; the defender can however
make full use of the cover concealment and obstacles offered
by the terrain whereas the attacker is restricted in movement
and is unable to exploit fully his superiority of means
The ground in rear of the position should favor a covered
withdrawal by screening the troops from hostile view and fire
as soon as the position is vacated
Field fortifications are reduced to the minimum ; full use is
made of obstacles demolitions and chemical interdictions in
front and on the flanks of the position and in the areas between
successive positions
â¢ 758 The conduct of delaying action is facilitated in open
terrain by selecting successive positions on high ground at
such distance apart that the enemy will be forced to displace
his artillery in order to attack the next position in rear In
wooded terrain the infantry bears the brunt of combat and
successive positions may be much closer together
In each position the main line of resistance should insure
facilities for artillery observation and for the delivery of
effective long range fire by other supporting weapons In
general the depth of the zone of resistance is not great The
artillery and the other supporting weapons are located close
to the line of resistance
9 759 When the enemy has superiority in combat aviation or
mechanized forces or both the commander must ordinarily
delay on a position until nightfall and then withdraw under
cover of darkness to the rear position Considerable distance
between positions enables the commander to utilize fully the
hours of darkness for withdrawal In such situations selection
of positions strongly protected by natural obstacles which
facilitate defense on a broad front becomes a primary consideration
3 760 In order to coordinate the operations the combat
zone is subdivided into sectors the boundaries of which are
extended to the rear to include initially the first two delaying
positions and later the final position in the commander's plan
of action In favorable terrain the width of sectors in delay-
78
OPERATIONS
760-765
ing action may be taken as about double those suitable for
defense
A tactical unit is assigned to each sector and is given a
combat mission The strength and composition of each unit
is determined by the assigned mission the terrain the width
bf the sector and the nature of the hostile threat Mutual
support between adjacent units is coordinated by the next
higher commander
Decentralization of operations to combat team commanders
will be frequent when operating on a broad front Continuous
liaison between adjacent combat teams and between
combat teams and the higher commander must be maintained
â¢ 76 The defense is conducted in each sector by small units
holding the natural strong points of the terrain and supporting
each other by flanking fire In close terrain or during
periods of low visibility close contact between adjacent
units is maintained by combat patrols Local reserves protect
the flanks of front line defense areas and cover the withdrawal
of forward elements
â¢ 762 Artillery in general support prepares a plan of interdiction
fires covering principal hostile avenues of approach
and is prepared to engage distant targets It is employed to
reinforce the artillery in direct support in accordance with
the requirements of the situation Special attention will be
given to interdiction of hostile movements toward the flanks
and rear
Light artillery will often be attached to the unit it supports
763 Engineers are employed to construct a barrier zone
of obstacles and demolitions in front of the first delaying
position and in the area between successive positions Antitank
units are attached to units covering the hostile avenues
of approach To protect an exposed flank a mobile flank
guard is detailed with engineers and antitank units attached
â¢ 764 Chemical troops may be employed to place barriers
of persistent chemicals on the front and flanks of each position
â¢ 765 The antiaircraft artillery is employed primarily to
protect the artillery reserves and critical defiles in rear
from hostile air attack
79
766-77
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
â¢ 766 A mobile reserve reinforced by tanks artillery antitank
units engineers and chemical troops is prepared to
move rapidly to counter mobile threats
â¢ 767 As in the defense of any position an outpost strong
in automatic weapons is deployed well in front of the delaying
position to harass and delay the enemy's advance and tb
keep him in doubt as to its location Artillery support for
the outpost will be provided by units supporting the delaying
position
M 768 The greatest importance attaches to keeping the enemy
in doubt as long as possible: concerning the location of
the successive delaying positions and the delaying nature of
the operations being conducted
â¢ 769 In fighting a delaying action some troops are disposed
on the rear position to cover the withdrawal from the positions
in front
â¢ 770 Timely measures are taken for reconnaissance and for
preparation necessary for the occupation of the successive
delaying positions in rear
Provision is made for the establishment of wire communication
from the higher commander to the sector commanders
and to the senior artillery commander Of especial importance
is efficient operation of the artillery wire net in
order that the flexibility of artillery fire may be exploited
to the maximum Signal communication to distant or detached
units is ordinarily limited to radio and messengers
The wire systems of subordinate units are limited to essential
lines Full use is made of prearranged visual signals
and of mounted and motorcycle messengers
â¢ 77 The commander controls the operation by prescribing
the time of withdrawal and the time by which each successive
position is to be occupied In open terrain it is often
better to make a timely and simultaneous withdrawal from
each position In close terrain or when a command is deployed
over a wide front this may be impracticable and the
decision regarding the time of withdrawal is then left to
subordinate commanders The commander exercises control
by prescribing a general terrain line to which units eventually
will withdraw or in front of which the enemy will be
held until a designated hour

â¢ 772 Whenever practicable withdrawal from a position is
effected under cover of darkness If protracted resistance is
necessary to accomplish this measures are taken to extend
the depth of the zone of resistance and to utilize to the
maximum natural obstacles
â¢ 773 If the withdrawal must be made in daylight artillery
and other supporting weapons are disposed in depth Combat
aviation and tanks are employed against those hostile
elements which most seriously threaten the success of the
operation A daylight withdrawal may also be facilitated
by organizing an intermediate delaying (covering) position
to be occupied by reserves assigned to cover the withdrawal
of troops in front (see par 708) Subsequent withdrawal of
the troops from the intermediate delaying position is in
turn covered by other troops on the next delaying position
in rear Retirement may thus be executed by the alternate
withdrawal of successive echelons from one delaying position
to the next
The loss of a defended tactical locality to the enemy does
not necessarily involve an early withdrawal along the whole
front Adjacent units should take advantage of such situations
to punish an impetuous enemy by heavy flanking
fire and by local counterattacks whenever conditions are
favorable

and the time element in signal communication and staff
action may be so short that the air unit must be attached
to the ground unit for operational control for definite limited
periods
0 042 Support of troops transported by air requires extremely
close coordination and close control Such operations
require special air force support including convoy' by
pursuit aviation to prevent hostile air action against the
expedition while in flight and on the ground after landing
Preliminary air attack on the landing area and its vicinity
may be required to destroy or disorganize local defenses
During the landing and subsequent ground operations supporting
air operations include the laying of a smoke screen
and the attack of defending or counterattacking units both
ground and air While in flight control of the movement
is a responsibility of the air commander

CHAPTER 5
THE DIVISION
SECTION I
INFANTRY DIVISION
0 043 The infantry division is the basis of organization of
the field forces It is the basic large unit of which corps
(except armored and cavalry) and armies are formed It is
the smallest unit that is composed of all the essential ground
arms and services and which can conduct by its own means
operations of general importance It can strike or penetrate
effectively maneuver readily and absorb reinforcing units
easily It can act alone or as part of a higher unit
The combat value of the infantry division derives from its
ability to combine the action of the various arms and services
to maintain combat over a considerable period of time In
active operations the division should be reinforced with air
observation means
When operating alone additional aviation engineer antitank
and supply means will normally be required by the division
0 044 There are two types of infantry divisions in the
United States Army which for convenience are designated as
the ""square"" and the ""triangular"" division The square division
retains the brigade organization for infantry and artillery
components each infantry brigade consisting of two infantry
regiments the artillery brigade of three regiments In
the triangular division on the other hand there is no brigade
organization Three infantry regiments and four field
artillery battalions comprise the major combat elements
All organic transportation of the square and the triangular
infantry divisions is motorized Neither of these divisions is
provided however with sufficient transportation to move all
its elements simultaneously
The triangular division organization eliminates the brigade
echelon in the chain of command with a corresponding
acceleration of order transmission The field artillery bat-

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
talions operate directly under the orders of the division artillery
officer representing the division commander
045 The doctrines of operations and combat by ground
nonmechanized forces discussed in earlier chapters of this
manual are applicable to the infantry division
046 When a division is operating as part of a higher unit
restrictions on the freedom of action of the division commander
are often necessarily imposed by the higher commander
In an advance the corps commander will ordinarily
prescribe a zone of advance for each division of the corps
The road net within the zone may largely influence the march
formations and supply arrangements within the division
The corps may also prescribe the general line which advance
guards of the divisions will cross at a given time at the beginning
of the march the extent of the march as well as any
special formation of the corps for the advance
Further coordination may be obtained by designating lines
which the various divisions must clear by specified times and
by designating rear boundaries for divisions at the completion
of each stage of the march
047 The army or corps has reconnaissance elements which
operate in advance of the divisions While cooperation and
contact between these reconnaissance elements and those of
the division are necessary their presence in no way relieves
the division commander of responsibility for reconnaissance
by and security for his own command
048 In combat the mission assigned the division may
require the division to act in close coordination and cooperation
with adjacent divisions or to operate at a distance from
the main force The decisions and actions of the division
commander in either situation are predicated upon the greatest
assistance to the successful execution of the task of the
higher commander
049 In all operations the personal reconnaissance of the
division commander is of the highest importance 'He makes
use of all available means of transportation to reach vantage
points from which he can gain direct information and exert
his influence most effectively and expeditiously on the operations
He must be provided with alternate means of signal
communication so that his orders can be speedily transmitted

SECTION II
MOTORIZED DIVISION
050 The motorized division is a triangular infantry division
which has sufficient additional organic motor transportation
to permit the simultaneous movement of all its
elements
â 05 The motorized division is a specially equipped highly
mobile unit intended primarily for employment by higher
commanders It has greater capability than the normal infantry
division for rapid movement under suitable conditions
but when dismounted maneuvers and fights in the same
manner as the normal division The characteristics of the
motorized division make it especially suited to execute the
following types of operations:
To provide close support of armored or tank units ; to consolidate
and hold gains made; to protect the flanks and rear
of armored or tank units and permit their continued advance ;
to relieve armored units when terrain renders their operations
unremunerative ; and to protect armored or tank elements
when withdrawn or halted periodically to refuel or to
reorganize
To seize and hold important localities pending arrival of
less mobile forces
To exploit success achieved by armored tank parachute
and other units
To execute envelopments and turning movements either in
close cooperation with armored and other mobile units or
under favorable conditions independently against hostile
flanks and rear or strategic localities
To constitute a powerful mobile general reserve for use
either offensively or defensively as the situation demands
â 052 Except in emergency situations motorized divisions
should be employed on missions which permit initially the
utilization of their inherent mobility primarily in support
of or in cooperation with other mobile forces When an independent
or semi-independent mission is contemplated for
a motorized division provisions should be made for reinforcing
it with reconnaissance and security means tanks additional

tion both day and night by means of vehicular radio periodic
reports control posts guides direction signs and other
expedients Additional control and coordination of reconnaissance
security and combat teams may be assured by
designation of phase lines
Maximum exploitation of the mobility of the motorized
division by day will be contingent upon control of the air
for the area of movement by motor At all times dispositions
must be made with due consideration of hostile air
observation and attack An adequate observation and warning
system must be in operation continuously and include
both ground and air elements Vehicular antiaircraft weapons
must be manned and alert for prompt action at all times
during movement and at halts Maximum use of cover concealment
and camouflage must be habitual Distances between
columns and vehicles in column are increased but
with due regard for the greater time length of the columns
and its effect on the tactical employment of the division
Close cooperation and coordination of reconnaissance and
security agencies of all echelons are essential to assure rapid
uninterrupted and secure movement of motorized units
Reconnaissance and security groups obtain and transmit
timely information of terrain routes and enemy dispositions
so as to prevent delay or countermarching of other elements
Engineer reconnaissance agents should accompany divisional
ground reconnaissance groups
053 The motorized division operates normally as two or
more closely coordinated combat teams which may advance
by separate routes or zones previously examined by reconnaissance
agencies When the situation calls for a strong
attack the division is assembled for concerted action by appropriate
maneuver so as to develop its full power
Operations must be conducted with the maximum speed
consistent with conditions of terrain roads and the tactical
situation For this reason engineers must march well forward
in order to insure expeditious advance in difficult areas
and negotiation of difficult points Similarly commanders
must habitually move near the head of respective groups
Decisions must be timely Orders must be brief normally
oral and fragmentary and transmitted by the most rapid
means available-radio visual signals staff officer or vehicular
messenger
256
OPERATIONS
053- 055
While speed and boldness must characterize the operations
of motorized divisions development for combat must be with
a proper appreciation of vulnerability to hostile combat aviation
artillery and mechanized units In the approach march
motors move across country when practicable with security
provided by reconnaissance vehicles Assembly areas or detrucking
points should provide maximum security and cover
for personnel and vehicles and be reasonably secure against
effective hostile artillery fire Parks for personnel carriers
must be properly concealed and camouflaged Park locations
should facilitate protection without necessity for detachment
of combat elements for that purpose Anticipatory
measures for further movement of vehicles from assembly
areas or parks must be habitual to include liaison agents and
communication with combat elements reconnaissance of forward
and rear routes and preparation of routes by engineers
Motorized divisions which are supporting armored units
must provide close support and prompt relief in order to
facilitate the continued rapid advance of the armored troops
In situations where further operation of the motorized
division is unprofitable it should be relieved promptly by less
mobile troops and released for use where its mobility can be
utilized
In exploiting a break-through motorized divisions may be
used in support of or in conjunction with armored divisions
â 054 The mobility of the motorized division provides
higher commanders a powerful flexible means to meet crises
in defensive situations and to launch surprise counterblows
The special characteristics of a motorized division make it
especially suitable for execution of delaying missions except
against armored units
In order to capitalize the mobility of the motorized division
close control of and coordination of combat teams
should be emphasized This involves both communication
means and technique and proper use of liaison agents within
the division and with other units

maneuvering mass is to be launched063 The reserve is kept mounted or close to its horsesIts initial location depends upon its contemplated employment The division commander uses the reserve promptlyto strike at a weak area in the hostile dispositions to pushthrough a success gained either by the pivot or the maneuvering force or to pursue a defeated enemyShould theattack fail the reserve may be

" . instance failure
to' reconnoitre a position and an area
for a night operation resulted .in a patrol
..being ambushed by outposts unknown
to the patrol leader and his
men
In all night operations have but a
single, objective . Never split a night
patrol-always keep it intact . Let
every man on scout and patrol know the
situation clearly . Give each man a definite
job and the responsibility for
carrying it out . . . .
An all-important point : Train men
to report only what they see, and not
to include any personal interpretations
. One outstanding example lesson
was the twisting of information reported.
An observation post reported
that three Italians had been seen coming
down a certain hill . The information
was relayed as three battalions
coming''down the hill

The importance of accurate map reading` an
interpretation are clearly' demonstrated : in the
report of a division commander , at' the- .conelusion
of the campaign :
At FONDOUK, and' :HILL` 609
this division had great difficulty, in map ,
reading: .' Officers had difficulty 'in. ac-.`
curately locating, themselves on map's,
and in following on the ground a route'
marked on a map . There are instances
of whole battalions becoming lost' at
night on the ,way to the jump-off line.
These incidents all bring out : the `'fact'
that map reading has been' neglected
and must, in the future, be continually
stressed in training . . ,
14. Securing and use of accurate G-2 information.
The securing of accurate and timely. G-2
information by intelligence personnel ;' .ivas
stressed in several of the reports . In all
echelons from the battalion intelligence sec-'
tion to the division G-2, the principles 'o f -.

of snipers' s ould be' given special attention.
c. The maintenance of ,uninterrupted controt

d. The'.use of smoke in different phases of
infantry,, :.operations assumed unexpected degrees,
of. importance. , The employment of,
smoke'' grenades, ,artillery 'cooperation with
smoke -'shell,', mortar smoke shell, and other
apparatus, all proved' highly effective . Smoke,
,was used .' for',r both offensive : and defensive
operations, for marking and identifying'
positions, ;targets,; and objectives .
e. Effective ;support from mortars and'arillery
frequently' depends on the work of
orward 'observers . In some infantry regitmentsofficers
; had learned the, technique of
?adjusting .;mortar, and . artillery fire by for-
-,ward observation methods . ' This provided a
at night. The standard of proficiency of our .
troops was initially unsatisfactory, but Improved
as experience was,gained . Two vital
needs were served by the improvement of our.
night operations
a. The essential element of surprise , when
needed.
b . The only means, 'at times, of getting
troops into position without severe' losses.
The essence of successful night ; operations
has been found to be simplicity of plan . The
subdivision of duties must be clearly understood
by all participants, and the individual
responsibilities assumed and carried out with'
vigor and dispatch . Such planning must
provide for continuous, effective control by
the leader or commander ; and for alternate
action in the event that unforeseen .develop
menu arise.
16. Miscellaneous.
In addition to major subjects above summarized,
the reports of +division and lower
unit commanders brought out the following
miscellaneous points :
.
a. Small unit training, especially with regard
to platoon and. junior leaders, is of prime
importance. The leadership, tactics, and
14

f. Coordination'; of all heavy:.~',supporting

guns, cannon company weapons, supporting
artillery, and mortars .
g. Proficiency in small-arms marksmanshi

(2) , In retrograde movements, when
communications are often lacking ; or inadequate,
individual, batteries may, often have to
cover the withdrawal of the , infantry' and
other artillery units . . ` Under .' these circumstances,
;, much will depend on! the observed
fires of individual ,batteries, without assistance
from'' the, fire 'direction' center . In one .
instance it has been `'reported - that ""a single
105mm howitzer, covered the'' withdrawal -of
the 'remainder of 'its battery and'. neutralized
6=gun German battery all by itself.""
(3) In a majority of different combat
operations, the : targets of opportunity that
appear, should betaken' under fire by individ
ual batteries' conducting their own observed
fire, either from established battery OP's or by
forward observers. In this connection, a division
commander, xeported at the close of
the campaign
In iall,'of our battles, . many favorable
targets-of opportunity were taken

by singlee batteries and neutralized
or destroyed by proper application
of the principles of observed fire

fire for a battalion of 155-howitzers
located on the opposite flank,, .
c. Observed fire and forward observation .-
The great majority of all fires delivered . by
division and reinforcing artillery'. were con-'
ducted 'by some type of observation . In:'one
division it was reported that, ""there was prac
tically no unobserved fire except ' harassing':
fires at night."" The preponderance of ''ob
served fire was largely due ;to' the nature o
the terrain, which afforded ridges ; hills;'and
mountains for observation posts, and was alsowell
suited for forward observation methods.
Three special situations have been . encount=
eyed, and ' probably will' be encountered'` in,
future operations, that make mastery of,all :,
observed fire methods essential to, the smaller
units, especially the battery and platoon'; ':
(1) In assault landings, when; the support
artillery often enters action by section ;
platoon, or battery, and there is no fire direc
tion center in operation in initial :, stages, ;
Under these conditions the delivery of . sup
porting fire depends entirely on ""the -ability
of the platoon and battery commanders . to.
conduct effective observed. fire .

Forward' observers must', be, highly proficient'

""the observer, 'too frequently, calls for fire

Forward 'observation pr,oved to be the most
effective means of conducting fire in âmoat
cases. In one' 'division it is,'reported' `that
""forward observation methods . . were used
almost entirely ,: , ; . :Each battalion had ., at
least ten forward, observers,"" who ,'often: a
justed the fire of different battalions through

:follows ;
Forward observers are - ;'vital',
Each battery. should have v,forward,'-' .
observer in addition to a : .battery ob-'
server closer to the ' guns.'' Each bat
talion should have at least one OP:
Observers within a battalion sector
must be coordinated, and . this coordina
tion should include 'ob'servation, posts
from infantry and supporting ; units ;
Forward observers are under the,'dirae-""
tion and control of liaison'' officers with
the front line -assault battalions. They,

and tactical principles of field artillery communication
as prescribed in standard training
literature . The need for proficient' signal
personnel, including men with ability to maintain
equipment and resort to improvisation
in difficult situations was emphasized by all
participating commanders . Artillery signal
troops must also develop a high degree of
ingenuity in establishing 'and maintaining
communications under all conditions . Wire
remains the primary means, of artillery communication,
with radio as a secondary or
emergency channel. The highest cooperation
and understanding between wire and' radio
personnel is essential to insure the combined
use of both means when 'the situation demands.
In so, me rapidly moving situations,
wire has been reported as the secondary channel,
though this should be regarded as an ex- .
ception to the general rule. Telephone and
radio discipline is vital, to prevent traffic
blocking. In . all artillery communications,
flexibility has been of cardinal' importance All units reinforcing the fire of another unit,.
or in direct' support, must provide communications
with the unit so reinforced or supported.
Lateral communications between bat
talions is important, and lateral communications
.between the division' artillery of adja -
cent divisions is of even greater importance.
Prearranged message ,codes, and a complete
and effective SOI are essential.
e. Unobserved fire.-In 'future operations,
the terrain may' not, afford such excellent
means of observation as have been experienced
in the Tunisian Campaign . In their reports,
division commanders have pointed out that
the principles and technique of prepared un-,
observed ;, fires must not: be overlooked, but
must be'mastered by all units . Emphasis was
given in'these reports to transfers of all types,
and to delivery of unobserved concentrations
and the: massing of . fires .
f. Fire control and .direction .'
(1) The- standard prescribed technique
of the, light battalion in direct support of its
combat-team
.
infantry regiment proved satisfactory
. in 'all, cases .
(2) When reinforcing artillery was
available, additional battalions were employed
to reinforce the fires of the' direct support
battalion . H The mission of the reinforcing
units,wasâdirect support' of, the light battalion . .

a ration p re to repulse such :attacks against;
new ained,'positions;; ' .;The importance . of
this pomt-, is . brought out by , one of the'divislon
, commanders in his ; report ;,on 'battle
experience
The artillery with this division
killed more Germans, when they made
these' counterattacks than it did ,in'all .'
the preparation, fire' on Aargets-of ., op
portunity, counter-battery, ""and; in sup
port,'during attack In~'.fact,',the BAR
ENTHIN Regiment must have learned ;;
'its lesson the hard .,way,, because, on the
`'last, position, it refused to counterattack.
(6) '. In'' some ; : instances' : bog- barrages
were used effectively:' .to extricate hardpressed,
infantry elements from difficulty.
(7) : Rolling barrages"""" were . used ; on
some `occasions :"", More , generally, to cover the
assat}it"" .'of' infantry, concentrations were fired
at prearranged .times determined after . consultation
.: with the infantry.. These concentrations
;were of sufficients:duration to permit ,
the` assaulting.'. infantry toll press close to ; the
covering fire before' it .â¢lifted,'' Normally the
l t , ?rounds' of such', concentrations were
smoke to signal the lifting'of the . fire. II
ing battalions'a.t all times without calling on
division artillery headquarters' to get the fire
The advantage of high speed in' delivery of
reinforcing fire was obtained ;through ; this
system. It is reported very eff ective', in' a l
cases where it has been used.'
(3) Another, method of controlling the ::
fires of reinforcing' or general support' units
was the placing of them under .tcohntero-l
of the division artillery gunnery officer who
assigned them missions on - call for help . from'""
the direct support battalions . ' This' method
has been found to be especially effective when the amount of general support artillery is`
limited.
(4) Experience 'has shown'' that `rigid'
adherence to combat-team organization in a
division action : often results ' in complicating'. .:
and reducing artillery support. In any'
method of controlling the fire of ""'organic and
attached units, all battalions must`always, be
available and under the command of the division
artillery,-,commander, who' can' ; place''
their fire wherever most. needed :.'

used, this type of fire has proved to be

long concentrations of slow fire are more effective
against prepared positions than a mass
of fire for a short duration . This doe's not

was practically impossible to avoid the
effect, but also because the continuous
pounding shattered their nerves . .. .

GERMANT, TA TI AL DO TRINE
23 . RE ONNAISSAN E BATTALION OF THE INFANTRY
DIVISION
The reconnaissance battalion of the infantry division is
employed as a unit, even if the division is advancing over
a broad front in several columns . The advance is made
by bounds somewhat shorter than those of the motorized
reconnaissance 1attalion . Scout groups are sent out
under the direction of the battalion commander . The
battalion can reconnoiter an area approximately 10 kilometers
(6 miles) in width, and seldom is sent more than 30
or 40 kilometers (25 to 30 miles) forward . The strength
of the scout groups (sometimes up to that of a platoon
with light machine guns) is, however, determined by the
situation and the mission . Patrols sent out from the
scout groups remain on the roads as long as possible,
advancing by bounds from observation point to observation
point.
Reconnaissance battalions of interior divisions are
usually withdrawn to the rear after the battle actually
begins . If, however, the division is operating over a
broad front or in difficult terrain, the battalion may be
reinforced, and utilized to fill in a gap or to seize an important
terrain feature. ommunications must be carefully
provided . Extra signal equipment and personnel may be
attached in exceptional cases .
24. BATTLE RE ONNAISSAN E
The purpose of battle reconnaissance is to reconnoiter
the enemy's front, flanks, and rear to establish definitely
the location of his flanks, artillery, heavy infantry
weapons, and reserves . 'Such reconnaissance locates our
OUN EALi E\T
own front line and often provides close ; in security and
terrain reconnaissance .8 Security is necessary at all times,
but reconnaissance must not be neglected to accomplish
security. Battle reconnaissance is established usually at
the opening phases of the development or deployment,
The advance of the infantry in the attack reveals very
quickly the location of hostile infantry and artillery ; also,
fire from our artillery upon , hostile infantry will generally
result in the hostile artillery delivering counterfire and
thus revealing its location .
There are both air and ground means available for
performing battle reconnaissance . Some of the specific
means of battle reconnaissance are : (a) Infantry patrols,
sometimes reinforced with light machine guns, heavy
machine guns, light mortars, or antitank guns . (b) Engineer
patrols, particularly valuable in approaching a fortified
area, a defile, or a river . (c) Artillery patrols, conisting
usually of an officer and a few mounted men
assigned to reconnoiter routes of approach, observation
posts, and fire positions . (d) Observation battalion (artillery),
skilled in locating targets by sound and flash, and
in evaluating aerial photographs .Â° (e) aptive balloons,
supplementing the preceding means and permitting a
general view over the hostile front .
8 Our observation posts and other friendly personnel, who are reconnoitering
for our own artillery, heavy infantry weapon, and antitank positions, can gain
much helpful information from units of the reconnaissance battalion . Sometimes
they actually accompany the battalion to get early information about
the terrain, potential targets, and gun positions .
Â° It assists our own artillery in firing on concealed targets by transmitting
weather data . By accurate surveying principles, it establishes the location
net for the batteries . The net is not restricted to the division sector, but
sometimes extends 6 to 10 kilometers (as much as 6 miles) .
Section VI . PRIN IPLES OF OMMUNIATION
The higher unit is responsible for the establishment and
maintenance.,.Qf. communication with the next lower unit .
Wire connection with neighboring units is always established
to the unit on the right. This rule does not release
the commanders of responsibility, however, to maintain
contact with units to their left .
Of special importance is the connection between artillery
and infantry. If an artillery unit is attached to an infantry
unit, then the infantry is responsible for the connection;
if the artillery is supporting an infantry unit, but
not attached to it, then the artillery is responsible for the
connection . If, however, the artillery, through some
special circumstances, is unable to establish the connection,
then the infantry must undertake the responsibility .
onnection with heavy infantry weapons is the responsibility
of the infantry commander concerned .
25. OPERATION OF SIGNAL OMMUNI ATION
TROOPS
The commander issues orders for the employment of his
communication units ordinarily after receiving the recommendations
of the communication officer . It is most
essential that the commander punctually give the communication
officer a -complete picture of the situation,
including the commander's intentions . The communication
means of a command post are assembled in a message
20
PRIN IPLES OR OMMUNI ATION
21
center . The proper functioning of communication is
dependent upon its useful employment on the part of the
commander and upon the technical training of personnel .
26. ORDER OF THE DIVISION OMMUNI ATION
OFFI ER
The order of the division communication officer should
contain : (a) The enemy situation, our own troops, the
plan of the commander ; (b) the mission of the signal
battalion ; (c) specific orders for the signal communication
companies and supply train ; (d) when applicable, instructions
relative to secrecy, replacement, utilization of coinmercial
nets, and system maintenance .
In the advance march, the division communication
battalion builds and maintains an axis of signal communication,
(wire lines) along the route upon which the
division commander and his headquarters are advancing .
In friendly territory, the existing commercial net is utilized
to a maximum ; in enemy territory, heavy field cable
is generally installed overhead . When contact with the
enemy has been established by the division, wire corn- .
munication must be maintained at all costs with the corps
and must also be supplemented by radio and other means .
Establishment of lateral connections within the division
and between divisions is also very important in coordinating
the tactical effort.
Within the division, all command posts and observation
posts should be connected according to their relative
importance . The division signal battalion will establish
lines to the infantry regiments, artillery commander, and
the artillery units operating under the artillery commander,,
as well as lateral connection to adjoining di22
GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
visions . When there is a deficiency of means, the establishment
of the aforementioned artillery connection has
priority . The division signal officer will coordinate the
establishment of the communication net and supervise its
construction by his own signal troops and the communication
troops_ of the various units . In a rapidly advancing
attack, in pursuit, or in wtihdrawals or retreat, he will
restrict the amount of installation .
27. OMMUNI ATION IN THE DEFENSE
In the defense a very extensive communication net is
established . Its construction is governed by the situation,
and by the time, materiel, and personnel available .
Several means of communication between all important
defensive installations are provided . Wire communication
is carried by buried cables . Special communication
nets (such as infantry, artillery, antiaircraft) are established
. Alarms for gas and air attacks are installed .
Technical means to intercept hostile messages are
intensified.
28 . VARIOUS MEANS OF OMMUNI ATION
When new troops are attached to a command, additional
communication requirements are introduced ; so reserve
communication personnel should always be held out .
The operation of communication troops must not be
interfered with in any manner by other units. The
various means of communication can be characterized
as follows:
.(a) Telephone .-Installation of the telephone requires
time and materiel. Wire lines are sensitive to such disturbances
as fire, wind, snow, frost, and storms . The
PRIN IPLES OF OAMTMIUONNI 23
enemy can easily listen in on conversations, particularly
over single-wire connections ; in the danger zone, therefore .
double lines and heavy insulated wires are used .
(b) Telegraph.-The telegraph is simple in operation
and installation, and very often cannot he easily intercepted.
The Morse code is utilized .
(c) Automobile, mounted, messenger, bicylist, motorcyclist,
runner,-In a war of movement, these means are often
the most reliable . They are used without hesitancy when
technical means are not available . Speeds of transmission
vary.11
(d) Radio .When wire connections fail or are not
functioning steadily, the radio is indispensable . Electric
storms, static, other radio transmission on similar wave
lengths, mountains, and other interferences minimize
effective range of hearing . In practice, radio is valuable
only if messages are short ; transmissions should therefore
be in telegram form, omitting all unessential words .
(e) Blinker .-This is an important signal means in
battle when wire lines are destroyed . It cannot be used
for great distances, and is greatly restricted by fog, mist .,
bright sunshine, or proximity of enemy observation .
Blinker messages must be very short, since 20 words
require about 10 minutes for transmission .
(f) Rockets, Very lights, flares .-These serve as signals
whose meaning has been prearranged and is thoroughly
understood by the troops concerned. Very pistols and
pyrotechnic equipment are carried habitually on light
10 Messenger on horse, 1 kilometer (%ths mile) in 5 to 7 minutes ; automobile
or motorcycle, 30 to 40 kilometers (25 to 31 miles) per hour-on good roads
considerably faster ; bicyclist, 15 to 20 kilometers (12 to 15 miles) per hour .
24 GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
telephone carts and also in all combat trains . Ability to
see these signal lights is greatly influenced by the terrain .
Also, there is always the chance of confusion with enemy
signal lights .
(g) Signal flags and panels .- -Prearranged signals with
these means enable ground troops to send short messages,
particularly in-communicating with airplanes and balloons .
(h) Alarms .-Horns, sirens, bells, and gongs are used
for gas or hostile airplane warning.
(i) Signal gun .-This small mortar, which projects a
message container, is useful in position warfare .
(j) ourier pigeons .-Although requiring at least 3
days to orient, courier pigeons are useful under heavy
fire, for they are sensitive to gas, and terrain does not
influence them . They fly about 1 kilometer (518ths
mile) in a minute . They do not fly in darkness, rain, or
storm, and with snow it is difficult for them to orient
themselves .
(k) Message dogs.-Expert and affectionate care by
the men in charge of message dogs results in most satisfactory
returns . Such dogs can be used under heavy
fire, and can remember and find locations on a battlefield
in a radius of about 2 kilometers (1 '4 miles) . They will
efficiently follow an artificially made track (scent) up to
6 kilometers . (about 4 miles) .
(1) Listening-in apparatus.-This apparatus is established
to determine the location of hostile activity in
planting mines, and to listen in on hostile communications .
(m) Airplanes .--An airplane may be used to connect
a division headquarters with its foremost elements or
neighbor units . In such cases, no other reconnaissance
mission should be given the plane . It is important to
PRIN IPLES OF OMMU I ATION
25
establish the location of the foremost line of infantry and
of the hostile line ; the infantry troops on prearranged
signal will display panels to assist the plane on the mission .
Planes may be used for artillery fire direction, and for
maintaining connection between division, cavalry division,
and corps or army headquarters. They are particularly
adapted to distributing quickly important orders or
delivering reports to units a 'considerable distance away .
(n) aptive balloons .-Balloons observe artillery fire,
give prearranged signals indicating the time of the day,
the signal to open fire, etc . Their communication means
include flags, panels, blinkers, and telephones . Weather
conditions, heavy-wooded terrain, and mountainous country
restrict their usefulness .

Section VII. ESTIMATE OF THE SITUATION
You must thoroughly work yourself into the stituation .
Place upon the situation map the location of your own
'troops and put down the information that you have
about the enemy. This information is built up by
reports from various sources, as suggested above under
the heading "" ombat Intelligence,"" Information must
be evaluated objectively ; one must be extremely careful
not to interpret what is received as one would like it to
be, or as one hoped it would be. A large part of the information
received in war is contradictory, a still greater
part is false, and by far the greatest part is very uncertain .
29. GUIDING PRIN IPLES
arefully read the orders received from the next higher
commander, and consider all information received . In
considering the situation, the following principles govern :
The first and most important principle is to utilize to
the maximum the available means . Any moderation in
this regard is a deterring factor in attaining the ultimate
goal. Second, concentrate as much of your force as
possible where you plan or believe the principal blow (the
main effort) will fall, and expose yourself disadvantageously
at other points, in order to be more certain of
success at the point of the main effort . The success of
the main effort more than compensates for any minor
losses sustained . Third, lose no time . Unless special
26
ESTIMATE OF THE SITUATION 27
advantages accrue by delay, it is very important that you
execute your plans as quickly as possible ; through speedy
action many measures of the enemy are nullified in their
initial stages . Finally, you must weigh each situation
independently, restricting yourself only to a consideration
of the essentials . The following questions may here
occur :
Mission.-What is my` mission? Does it require decisive
action or delaying action? Must I fight an independent
action or will I be influenced by the movements
or action of other troops?
Terrain.-What is the condition of terrain between my
troops and the enemy? Which routes lead toward the
enemy? Where does the terrain permit approaches
covered from air or land observation for an attack on the
enemy position? When my mission requires defense,
where does the terrain offer favorable defensive positions?
What possibilities are therefore available for the fulfillment
of my mission?
Enemy.-What can the enemy do to counter my plans""
Where is the enemy now located? "" Are there any bases
for his strength and organization? What can he do,
making correct tactical suppositions? 12 Are there any
indications that the enemy has acted incorrectly? Do I
know anything about the ability or personality of the
commander or the condition of his troops? How will the
terrain influence the enemy's action? How can I best
fulfill my mission with the most damage to the enemy?
n Always favor the enemy in computing the distances possibly covered by
the enemy since his position was last reported .
12 Always assume that he will carry outt his plan most disadvanttageously to
you .
28
GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
Own troops .-Where are my own troops? Which are
immediately available? Which troops can be later drawn
in? And when? -Are special transportation means such
as a railroad or motor trucks at my disposal? What can
I expect from my troops considering their past performance?
How is the supply situation, especially with regard
to ammurli~ign? Is support from other organizations
possible? Which of the present possible solutions
will give the greatest success?
30. HANGING THE MISSION
As a result of all these considerations, is the accomplishment
of my mission no longer possible? (When, owing
to unavoidable circumstances or unpredictable events, it
is impossible to carry out a mission, then and then only
may I change my mission, and I must then assume full
responsibility for the change . I must select a substitute
mission to assist effectively the general scheme of maneuver.
I must notify at once the next higher commander
in case I decide that it is impossible to carry out my
assigned mission .)
31 . SEIZING THE INITIATIVE
In general, when confronted by a vague situation and
difficult circumstances, as is often the case in war-be
active . Seize and maintain the initiative . Do not expect
or await hints or suggestions from the enemy relative to
your next move.
Section VIII . THE DE ISION
The decision must indicate a clear objective to be
attained by the coordinated and aggressive use of available
means . The strong will ,of the leader must dominate
at all times ; often the stronger will compels victory .
Never let anxiety over personal security interfere or
influence in any manner the real task, which is the annihilation
of the enemy . almly weigh the situation, thinking
quickly but overlooking nothing essential . Insure that
all assistants clearly understand your plans . Nervousness
on your part is quickly reflected by subordinates.
Never hold a council of war . omplication and confusion
are frequently introduced, and generally only an
incomplete decision results. One can think through a
situation much better and reach a definite decision by
independently estimating the situation .""
Once a decision is made, do not deviate, except for
excellent reasons. In this connection, however, one can
bring about disaster by obstinately clinging to the initial
decision when justifiable grounds are present for a change .
The true art of leadership is the ability to recognize when
a new decision is required by the developments or changes
in the situation . The commander should be resolute but
not obstinate .
to The division commander will generally hear the suggestions and proposals
of his chief of staff .
29
Section IX . FIELD ORDERS
Publishing orders is an art that can be learned only by
continual practice . Prompt distribution of faultless
orders furthers 't11e confidence of the troops in the leader
and often has decisive influence in achieving success in
combat, onversely, power in the attack or strength to
resist in the defense can be greatly reduced by faulty
orders .
ommanders of divisions or larger units generally use
written orders . Simple instructions and brief missions
may be communicated orally or through the communications
net, but the text should be simultaneously recorded .
ommanders of units smaller than a division generally use
oral orders, but again, the text must be recorded in writing.
While higher commanders usually make reference
to points or areas on maps, commanders of small units
point out or make such designations actually on the terrain
. Although oral discussions with subordinates may
contribute to clarity, the leader should not . become dependent
upon such discussions . Decisions and orders
remain the direct responsibility of the leader himself.
32 . GENERAL RULES
The following rules embrace accepted fundamentals
and help to gain uniformity: (a) Do not issue orders until
your plan of action is definitely established . (b) Distribute
the order early enough to allow the lower echelons
time for further dissemination and full compliance .
30
FIELD ORDERS 3 1
(c) reate conditions that are conducive to clearness and
conciseness, leaving nothing to mutual agreements . (d)
Place yourself mentally in the shoes of the subordinates
receiving the order . (e) State only what subordinates
must know for the proper performance of their tasks .
(f) Always state definitely whether the combat is to be
attack, delaying action, or defense, and whether the
troops must remain ""prepared for action"" or whether
they ""may rest ."" (g) Issue affirmative statements,
avoiding ambiguous or vague expressions and statements
of exaggeration ."" (h) Include a brief commendation of
a unit for the execution of a difficult or unusual task,
particularly when troops are ordered to withdraw, to
retire, or to pursue under circumstances difficult for the
troops to comprehend . (i) Use prescribed abbreviations
. (j) Embody pertinent information for each subject,
unit, or weapon in a separate paragraph, underlining
key words or phrases . (k) Number all orders successively,
also the paragraphs within the order .
33 . WARNING ORDERS (VORBEFEHLE)
Warning orders, usually transmitted orally, by telephone,
or by radio, are issued to troops to give advance
information about the will of the commander . The
information contained therein is influenced by existing
circumstances-the time available, the situation with
respect to the enemy and our own troops, etc .-but in
general will include such items as the plan of the commander,
arrangements for reconnaissance and security,
time and place of departures, march destination, bivouacs,
halts, and changes of direction . Warning orders must
14 A statement of conjecture or expectation must be definitely stated as
such.
32 E:RMIANT TA TI AL DO TRINE
be followed as soon as practicable by a complete order or
an individual order .
34. OMPLETE OPERATIONS ORDERS
(GESAMTBEFEHLE)
omplete operations orders present a full survey of the
situation with respect to the enemy and our troops, the
plan of the c6i`f tinder, the role each unit will play, and
pertinent information for the troops . The usual arrangement
follows:
Enemy.-Pertinent information of the enemy, including
strength, dispositions, condition, losses sustained,
defeats suffered, and the commander's expectation of
what the enemy may do.
Own troops.-A brief orientation involving the next
higher units, neighboring units, and special supporting
units.
`. . General plan.-A clear and concise expression of the
plan of the commander (not repetition of the plan of the
next higher commander), to ensure that subordinates
fully understand his intentions .
Detailed plan.-An announcement of the specific details
relating to such matters as reconnaissance, missions,
supply and evacuation, communication, and the command
post.""
16 As to reconnaissance, the detailed plan mentions the enemy information
desired, the areas to be reconnoitered and by whom and when, the time and
place where resulting reports are to be sent, and the sequence of reconnaissances
according to their urgdncy . As to missions, what each unit with indicated
attachments or detachments must fulfill is clearly stated . In respect to
supply and evacuation, the definite functioning of agencies in relation to the
combat elements is specified . As regards communication, the axis of communication
for the unit publishing the order is indicated, and special instructions,
such as those pertaining to the use of the radio or existing commercial
nets, are included . As for the command post, the location of the commander's
headquarters and the time when it opens or closes, etc ., are given,
35. SEPARATE ORDERS (EINZELBEFEHLE)
Separate orders (Einzelbefehle) are issued when circumstances
render it impractical or unnecessary to issue a
complete operations order (Gesamtbefehl) . Such circumstances
include situations wherein individual units must
be given specific or special instructions, or where the time
available does not permit the issuance of a complete
operations order . The separate order (Einzelbefehl) contains
the necessary information to insure coordination of
effort ; and later the publication of the complete field order
will include such information, briefly stated, as was sent
out previously in individual orders .
36. SPE IAL INSTRU TIONS
(BESONDERE ANORDNUNGEN)
Special instructions supplement operations orders with
information principally concerning ammunition, communication,
equipment, food supply, transportation, medical
and veterinary service, construction, and civil
population. In general, special instructions are written
and are issued direct to the units or agencies that they
concern.

FIELD ORDERS 33
Section X. MAR HES
All arrangements pertaining to a march should be
based upon the premise that the mass of the force must
arrive at the new destination with the minimum effort and the maxiiii aoh secrecy. When contact with the enemy
is imminent, the march formation should favor easy and
rapid development for combat . When contact is unlikely,
the comfort of the command is the important
consideration . In view of modern air developments,
movements under cover of darkness will be the rule
rather than the exception . There will be circumstances
requiring day marches, however ; or they may be safely
undertaken when the weather precludes hostile air
activity .
37. MAR HING IN MULTIPLE OLUMNS
The command should be marched in multiple columns,
using all available routes, thereby saving the strength of
the troops, affording better protection against air attacks,
and maintaining the command in such formation as to
facilitate development for combat . The following considerations,
however, prevail : (a) Organization in depth
permits freedom of maneuver . (b) Echelonment of some
columns on the open flank affords protection or facilitates
later envelopment of the hostile flank when the enemy is
fixed in the front . (c) The strength of columns and the
location of stronger columns will be determined by the
whereabouts of the enemy and by the tactical plan, as
34
MAR HES
35
influenced by the terrain. (d) If'the situation is initially
too vague to determine such dispositions, then several
weak columns should be marched into aggressive action
against the enemy to clarify the situation ; the mass of
the force may then follow in one or more columns . (e)
The width of the advance should not be so broad as to
preclude the building up of a main effort when contact
with the enemy is made . (f) Zones of advance with
boundaries should be indicated . (g) And, lastly, transmission
of orders and reports must be carefully organized,
38. MAR HING IN SINGLE OLUMN
The division sometimes cannot avoid marching in a
single column . The great disadvantage is the extraordinary
length, which precludes assembling for a coordinated
effort in 1 day . An advantage of the single
column over multiple columns is greater security and
flexibility for changing direction .
39. PROTE TION AGAINST AIR ATTA KS
The movements of large forces are protected by antiaircraft
precautions, particularly at initial points, river
crossings, and defiles. Antiaircraft batteries advancing
by bounds are set out in advance to front and flanks to
provide protection at these critical points . The commander
must insure that antiaircraft units have priority
on roads. The danger from air attacks during daylight
is greatly reduced by the following appropriate methods :
Increasing the depth of march columns-At the command
Fliegermarschtiefe! (air defense depth), the troop
units, horse-drawn elements, and other vehicles double
the distances normally maintained on the march . Simul36
GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
taneously it is indicated whether security forces, such as
flank or advance guards, maintain, increase, or decrease
distances. Arrangements are made for air defense depth,
if circumstances require such precaution, at the beginning
of the march ; or rest periods may be used to increase or
decrease distances,. With short march columns, extension
or retraction are also accomplished during the march .
Increasing the breadth of march columns .-At the command
Fliegermarschbreite! (air defense breadth), the
troops spread out, using both sides of a highway or
even expanding into the adjacent fields . The formation
invariably imposes march difficulties upon the troops
and is avoided whenever possible . When troops are
already marching in air defense depth, it is seldom
necessary to require the additional precaution of marching
in air defense breadth .
Dividing a column.-Very long columns marching along
a single route are broken up into several short groups
with between 1- and 3-kilometer (%- to 2-mile) intervals .
Disposing of the motorized units .-The motorized units
of the infantry division, except the reconnaissance
battalion or units employed on security missions, are
divided into groups and follow the various columns,
advancing by bounds. If the situation permits, they
are organized into a motorized column and marched on
a special road . Motor vehicles are also marched in the
intervals between the advance guard and the main body,
and between units of the main body .
Averting hostile planes .-Upon the approach of hostile
planes, air guards promptly sound the warning, using prearranged
signals . Marching troops throw themselves
down on, or off to the sides of, the road . Motor vehicles
Q7
halt, and their drivers set the brakes . Mounted troops
clear the road and continue the march under available
cover . Antiaircraft weapons immediately fire upon the,
hostile planes, but riflemen do not fire unless a plane cones
within range . Frequently the troops are put in readiness
to withstand a simultaneous air and gas attack . At night,
if flares are employed by the hostile fliers, foot soldiers
throw themselves to the ground off the roadside . Everyone
else and all vehicles remain absolutely motionless
while antiaircraft artillery provides defense .
40. NIGHT MAR HES
Although night marches initially tax the strength of
troops, this disadvantage is minimized after troops become
adjusted to resting in day bivouacs and eating regularly
on a changed schedule . Night marches have
decided advantages : they `deny altogether or restrict
materially hostile ground and ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sheets 3 and 4
GSGS 4336 1/100,000
Sheets 2 and 3
Object
1. To capture the islands of Walcheren and Zuid Beveland, thus enabling
the port of Antwerp to be used.
Assumption
2. That First Canadian Army has cleared the mainland up to the south shore
of the West Scheldt from Antwerp to the sea.
Considerations
Topography
3. The whole question of topography including both the Walcheren group
of islands and the West Scheldt has been studied in considerable detail by
both GS Intelligence and the Chief Engineer of First Canadian Army. These
studies are included in the following documents:-
(a) GS Intelligence  Intelligence Report No. 2 dated
16 September 1944.
Acting Army Commander
(b) Chief Engineer:
(i) Memorandum of the Chief Engineer on Operation Infatuate
(CE 1-0-3-1/Main HQ First Cdn Army dated 14 September 1944).
(ii) A map of the general area with an overlay trace showing
results of photographic interpretation with reference to beaches, dykes,
inland waterways and communications. (Only one copy was prepared and
this was handed to the Chief Engineer 2 Canadian Corps on 16 September).
Enemy Defences
4. GS Intelligence First Canadian Army from information received from
21 Army Group and from interpretation of recent photographic cover, have
prepared a defence trace of the island of Walcheren which shows defences
along the North West coast and comparatively heavier defences on the
South West coast and in the vicinity of Flushing 1024. However, since
these defences on Walcheren were constructed, a completely different
situation faces the Germans in that island today. The forces opposing him,
instead of being over the North Sea will be along the south shore of the
West Scheldt and on the mainland to the east of Zuid Beveland. He must
therefore defend Zuid Beveland unless he is prepared to weaken his defence
of Walcheren. So far, there is little indication of defences being prepared
on Zuid Beveland, Noord Beveland or Tholen. It is possible that we can
expect the perimeter of Zuid Beveland to be defended against a water-borne
assault and against penetration from the mainland to the east. He will likely
establish lines of defence, one at the isthmus connecting Zuid Beveland to
the mainland and another along the obstacle of the Beveland Canal.
Availability of Equipment
5. It is planned that, by 24 September 44 the complete 5 ARE Regiment
comprising 5 Squadrons (one squadron from 6 ARE Regiment) with a total
of approximately 40 Terrapins, 20 LVT 2 and 80 LVT 4s will be
concentrated on the River Scheldt above Antwerp in the vicinity of 5285.
These will be available for Operation Infatuate.
6. The Weasel availability is still somewhat obscure. There will likely be
available for this operation approximately 60 of the M29 type which float
but are NOT self propelled in water. The Weasel M29c, a completely
amphibious vehicle, has arrived in the United Kingdom and 100 should be
available for shipment to France on 20 September.
7. The Royal Navy through ANCXF have advised that they can make
113
available to First Canadian Army for this operation 70 LCA and 20 LOT,
but it must be pointed out that these cannot be used in the operation unless:-
(a) The LCA are brought by tank transporter from a channel port,
such as Ostend, to the West Scheldt.
(b) The LCA and LOT are taken by inland waterways to the West
Scheldt. The problem of bringing these craft by canals is being studied, but
it is considered by the Chief Engineer that pending further examination,
considerable work would have to be done before the canals are made
useable by reason of demolished bridges and lock gates. Also it is
considered that the Bailey bridging may NOT permit the passage of those
craft underneath.
8. The Royal Navy point out that the crews available for these landing craft
are NOT trained to carry out a set-piece combined operation.
Additional Resources
9. Depending on the priority laid down by the Supreme Allied Commander,
airborne forces represented by parachute brigades may be made available to
First Canadian Army for this operation. A general study is being made now
by HQ First Allied Airborne Army, who subject to the approval of the
Supreme Allied Commander, might make available the two parachute
regiments (brigades) of the 17 US Airborne Division. This division consists
of newly trained troops who as yet have NOT had the experience of tactical
dropping under active service conditions. If the airborne operation is NOT
required until after 1 October, the parachute brigades of 6 British Airborne
Division might be available and HQ First Allied Airborne Army suggest
that these brigades would likely be better trained than those of 17 US
Airborne Division.
10. The Royal Navy are prepared to assist in this operation by allotting the
Monitors HMS Roberts and HMS Erebus, each with 2x15 guns, for
bombarding tasks.
11. Belgian river pilots could probably be obtained for piloting landing
craft in the West Scheldt. On the other hand, if water-borne operations in
the East Scheldt are undertaken, piloting would have to be done by Dutch
pilots and it is understood that their integrity may NOT be relied on.
Courses Open to the Enemy
12. There appears to be NO question that the enemy appreciates the
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
114
Acting Army Commander
importance of the Port of Antwerp to the Allied forces, and having
appreciated this, that he will attempt, after being forced from the mainland,
to continue to dominate the West Scheldt from the islands of Walcheren and
Zuid Beveland. The degree of his defences however will depend to some
extent on the success of the present operation of Second British Army to
secure bridgeheads over the Ijssel, Waal, Maas and Neder Rijn in Holland.
It is likely that he will be apprehensive of an encirclement of his forces in
Holland and in view of the urgent necessity to withdraw as many of his
troops as he can to defend Germany, he may decide to withdraw a larger
part of his forces from the task of defending these islands and the coast of
Holland than he may have originally planned to do.
13. The 21 Army Group estimate is that the enemy may leave as large a
garrison as 10,000 troops to defend the islands of Walcheren, Zuid
Beveland and Noord Beveland. However, if he is faced with the possibility
of these forces being cut off by the thrust of Second British Army, and his
defences of these islands are subjected to heavy bombardment by naval and
ground artillery together with heavy air attack, he may decide to leave only
a small retraining force. Therefore any plan for the capture of these islands
by us should embrace plans for the quick exploitation of light enemy
resistance.
Courses Open to Us
14. It is reasonable to discard at the outset the possibility of mounting a
successful combined operation to capture Walcheren Island by assaulting
the only possible suitable beaches, which are on the North West and South
West coasts because this could only be done after considerable time spent
on combined training and preparation.
15. Possible courses with variations that are worthy of consideration are
outlined below. These combine the use of airborne forces and water-borne
forces to assist in the ground operation.
16. These courses are all based on the assumption that the island of
Walcheren would be too difficult to capture without securing beforehand
the island of Zuid Beveland.
17. To permit the capture of Zuid Beveland, it is considered that a
necessary preliminary is the securing by First Canadian Army of an area
from which operations can be directed from the mainland along Zuid
Beveland from the East. It is felt, therefore, that a firm base must be
115
secured in the area Roosendaal 7231, Antwerp 6895 and Bergen op Zoom
6027.
18. Each of the courses to be considered is based on constant efforts to
neutralize the enemys battery positions and to destroy his defences on the
islands of Walcheren and Zuid Beveland by naval and ground artillery fire
and by heavy and medium bombing together with attacks by RP and fighter
bombers. The ground artillery, apart from the divisional artillery of the
force working along Zuid Beveland from the east should be placed as soon
as possible in suitable areas along the south side of the West Scheldt so that
this artillery can continually carry on neutralization of the enemys batteries
as well as being able to support the advance of the troops from the east.
Course A
19. To establish a firm base on the mainland to the east of Zuid Beveland,
covering the landward thrust along the island from the east.
20. When the line of the Beveland Canal has been reached to carry out an
airborne operation with one parachute brigade designed to disorganize the
enemy and to secure the small harbour at Hoedekenskerke 3420.
21. Using this small harbour and by scrambling over the dykes themselves,
to build up through the airborne bridgehead with water-borne troops from
either the forces thrusting West along Zuid Beveland or troops held ready
for this role on the mainland to the south of West Scheldt.
22. To gain control of the entire island of Zuid Beveland.
23. To carry out a second airborne operation with one parachute brigade
designed to secure a bridgehead on the island of Walcheren covering the
causeway between that island and Zuid Beveland.
24. To build up through this bridgehead, by using either or both the
causeway and ferrying craft, with the forces already on Zuid Beveland.
25. To capture Middelburg 1430.
26. Finally, to clear the island of Walcheren by thrusts directed, on Flushing
1024 from the area of Middelburg, and on the other important defences in
the North West end of the island in the vicinity of Domburg 0637.
Advantages
(a) Prevents the enemy reinforcing the islands except by waterborne
means.
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
116
Acting Army Commander
117
(b) The capture of Zuid Beveland first provides a base from which
operations against Walcheren can more easily take place.
(c) Disorganize the enemys defences of Zuid Beveland by the
first airborne dropping and prevents him holding the line of the Beveland
Canal.
(d) By the use of a subsidiary water-borne force, exploitation of
the airborne bridgehead in the vicinity of Hoedkenskerke can quickly take
place.
(e) By the use of the second airborne landing a means is provided
of obtaining a bridgehead on Walcheren Island permitting the use of the
causeway connecting Zuid Beveland and Walcheren.
(f) Once Middelburg has been captured, it enables the defences of
Walcheren to be defeated in detail.
Disadvantages
(a) If the two parachute brigades are used separately, full value of
the concentrated effort of the airborne forces is NOT obtained.
(b) The small harbour of Hoedekenskerke may NOT permit the
immediate landing of wheeled and tracked vehicles due to tidal conditions.
In any event the harbour is quite small and the discharge of vehicles would
be quite slow.
(c) The water-gap between Zuid Beveland and Walcheren south
of the causeway is impassable to landing craft, although Weasels M29c
might possible get across.
Course B
27. Course B is the same as Course A with the exception that the airborne
forces would be concentrated and used only for the task of securing a
bridgehead on Walcheren Island in the vicinity of the causeway.
Advantages
(a) The advantages for this course are much the same as for
Course A without that of assisting in the quick capture of Zuid Beveland.
(b) There is the added advantage that, by using the full airborne
forces on the island of Walcheren, the development of operations to capture
Walcheren, once the causeway has been reached, can progress more
quickly.
Disadvantages
(a) Disadvantages in regard to the harbour at Hoedekenskerke and
the water-gap between Zuid Beveland and Walcheren are the same as for
Course A.
(b) A further disadvantage is that by NOT using a part of the
airborne forces to obtain a bridgehead in the vicinity of the small harbour at
Hoedekenskerke, the water-borne operation becomes a water-borne assault.
Course C
28. To establish a firm base on the mainland to the east of Zuid Beveland
as in Course A.
29. To thrust west along Zuid Beveland to the Beveland Canal.
30. When the line of the Beveland Canal has been reached to launch a
minor water-borne assault from across the West Scheldt to secure the small
harbour at Hoedekenskerke with the object of turning the enemys right
flank.
31. To gain control of the entire island of Zuid Beveland.
32. To bring assault craft and amphibians through the Beveland Canal to
the East Scheldt and by their use to secure with a small force a bridgehead
on Noord Beveland.
33. To gain control of the entire island of Noord Beveland.
34. To use the full airborne forces available to secure a bridgehead on the
island of Walcheren covering the causeway between that island and Zuid
Beveland as well as any landing places from the causeway up to and
including Veere 1735.
35. To develop this bridgehead by a build-up of forces over the causeway
and through Veere by using naval, military and civilian craft.
36. To capture Middelburg and develop subsequent operations as suggested
in Course A.
Advantages
(a) Concentrate the airborne forces on the important task of
gaining a bridgehead on the island of Walcheren.
(b) Gives us control of the inland waters between Zuid Beveland
and Noord Beveland which appear to give a better approach by water to
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
118
Acting Army Commander
119
Walcheren than across the mud flats to the south of the causeway. (This
requires further study).
(c) The capture of Noord Beveland prevents the enemy
reinforcing or withdrawing from Walcheren.
Disadvantages
(a) Awater-borne assault across the West Scheldt, even of a minor
nature, might prove difficult without the assistance of airborne troops.
(b) The small harbour at Hoedkenskerke may NOT permit the
immediate landing of wheeled and tracked vehicles due to tidal conditions
and may require preliminary work by engineers. In any event the harbour
is quite small and the discharge of vehicles would be quite slow.
37. The problem should also be considered in the light of airborne forces
NOT being available to us. Under these circumstances the following
courses appear to be open.
Course D
38. To establish a base on the mainland to the east of Zuid Beveland from
which a force to be directed to the west along Zuid Beveland.
39. As required to loosen the enemys resistance, to conduct water-borne
operations directed on the enemys right flank mounted, as either lefthook
operations by troops already on the island, or by troops held ready on
the mainland to the south of the West Scheldt.
40. To clear completely Zuid Beveland.
41. To secure the causeway between Zuid Beveland and Walcheren by a
frontal attack over the causeway assisted by an assault crossing of the
water-gap south of the causeway.
42. To enlarge the bridgehead thus gained on Walcheren by the passage of
troops over the causeway and by landing craft and amphibians.
43. To capture Middelburg.
44. From Middelburg to direct thrusts on Flushing and on the other
important defences near the north west and south west coasts.
Advantages
(a) Prevents the enemy reinforcing the islands except by waterGUY
SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
120
borne means.
(b) The capture of Zuid Beveland provides a firm base from
which operations against Walcheren can more easily take place.
(c) By the use of water-borne operations it keeps the enemy from
stabilizing his position.
(d) Once Middelburg has been captured, it enables the defences of
Walcheren to be defeated in detail.
Disadvantages
(a) Few suitable harbours exist on the South shore of Zuid
Beveland which are necessary to support initially a water-borne operation.
(b) The water-gap between Zuid Beveland and Walcheren south
of the causeway is impassable to landing craft, although Weasels M29c
might possibly get across.
Course E
45. To capture Zuid Beveland as outlined in Course D.
46. By the use of landing craft and amphibians brought through the
Beveland Canal to assault and secure Noord Beveland.
47. Combined with a frontal attack along the causeway between Zuid
Beveland and Walcheren, to launch a water-borne attack on Walcheren from
Noord Beveland  this is to be directed on the small harbours between the
causeway and Veere.
48. Once bridgeheads have been established, to capture Middelburg.
49. Finally to secure Walcheren completely as suggested in Course D.
Advantages
(a) The same advantages apply as for Course D in respect of the
securing of Zuid Beveland.
(b) Gives us control of the island waters between Zuid Beveland,
Noord Beveland and Walcheren which appear to give a better approach by
water to Walcheren than across the mud flats to the south of the causeway.
(This requires further study).
(c) To capture of Noord Beveland prevents the enemy reinforcing
or withdrawing from Walcheren.
Acting Army Commander
Disadvantages
(a) The same disadvantages apply as for Course D in respect to
the securing of Zuid Beveland.
(b) It would be difficult to provide supporting artillery fire for the
assault crossing mounted from Noord Beveland.
Conclusions
50. If airborne forces are available, Course A appears to be the most
suitable course to adopt and if airborne forces are NOT available Course D
appears to offer the least difficulties.
51. It must be emphasized that whatever course is adopted should provide
for the possibility of the enemy defences on Zuid Beveland and Walcheren
being easily pierced after air attacks and heavy bombardment, and therefore
a subsidiary force, from either the division being directed landwards to the
west along Zuid Beveland, or from another formation available on the
mainland to the south of the West Scheldt, should be available with the
necessary naval, military and civilian craft and amphibians to make an
assault landing in the vicinity of suitable ferry sites. In other words the plan
should be flexible in order to take advantage quickly of enemy weakness by
an assault crossing of the West Scheldt combined possibly with an airborne
landing.
52. The necessary naval, military and civilian crafts, with amphibians,
should be positioned at least in the Scheldt below Antwerp from where they
could be quickly used to take advantage of an opportunity as suggested in
paragraph 51.
53. Airborne forces are considered to be a most important adjunct to this
operation and a strong representation should be made to have them
available.
54. Air attacks by Bomber Command and by resources within 2 TAF on the
enemys batteries and defences should take place as soon as possible and
should continue until the ground forces are able to complete the capture of
the islands.
55. As soon as the enemy has been cleared from the south shore of the West
Scheldt, all available artillery resources for this operation, apart from the
artillery of the division to whom is allotted the task of capturing these
islands, should be positioned to commence the neutralization of the
121
enemys batteries.
56. The use of deception should be considered with the object of
misleading the enemy into expecting a sea-borne assault either on the north
west or south west coasts of Walcheren.

Main Headquarters
2nd Canadian Corps
21 September, 1944
TO: GOC-in-C, First Cdn Army
1. I have carefully studied the appreciation drawn up by the Plans
Section at HQ First Cdn Army dealing with Operation INFATUATE. I
have the following comments to make and would request that they receive
careful consideration in the formulation of plans.
2. As I understand it, the object of the operation is NOT to capture the
islands of WALCHEREN and SUID BEVELAND but to destroy,
neutralize or capture enemy defences which deny to us free passage
through the WEST SCHELDT to the port of Antwerp.
3. The Appreciation begins with the assumption that we hold the whole of
the SOUTH bank of the SCHELDT. At the present time the enemy is
strongly posted along the line of the LEOPOLD CANAL from about
HAVEN 1804 to HEYST 8614. With the exception of a few dyked roads,
the areas between HAVEN and 0102 and between OSSTKERK 9006 and
HEYST are inundated. The gap between these inundations is the only
approach to enemy positions NORTH of the LEOPOLD CANAL and most
of this gap is covered by the dual courses of the LEOPOLD and LYS
CANALS  a most difficult obstacle. It is within the enemys power to
increase the inundations or, indeed, except for the dune area along the
NW coast, to sink the whole of the area between LEOPOLD CANAL
and the SCHELDT. The clearing of this area may be a major operation
and barring the fact that it will deny to the enemy the employment of his
guns around KNOCKE 9015, it may be so saturated that it would be
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
122
Acting Army Commander
useless to us for gun positions from which the WALCHEREN defences
may be commanded.
4. In most military appreciations the ground is the one constant on which
firm conclusions can be based. This is not the case in the particular
problem under consideration. A German document in our possession
makes it clear that the conditions most advantageous to the defence and
most disadvantageous to us are those of ground saturation. This to us
the use of the ground for movement to exactly the same extent as if it was
completely flooded but allows the enemy the use of his roads, avoids the
flooding of buildings, stores and many works which might be of
importance to him. Attacking across a saturated area, movement is
possible only on top of dyked roads. We sacrifice every advantage which
we normally possess in the offensive. The defensive fire power can all be
concentrated on narrow approaches. Mines and obstacles are most
effective. With room to deploy on a dry belt behind a saturated area,
the enemy can concentrate their fire while keeping their dispositions well
concealed and well dispersed. The land approach via SUID BEVELAND
appears attractive but it may well turn out to be an approach down a
single stretch of road some five miles in length, bordered by impassable
ground on either side. It would be equivalent to an assault landing on a
one craft front on a coast where it was only possible to breach one
craft at a single pre-known point on which the whole fire power of the
defences could be concentrated. I consider that the project of an assault
across water cannot be ruled out if WALCHEREN ISLAND must be taken.
It may be the only way of taking it. Though it would be a last resort and a
most uninviting task, I consider it would be quite wrong to make no
preparations for it, and to be faced at some later time with the necessity
of having to improvise at very short notice. I am strongly of the opinion
that the necessary military and naval forces should now be earmarked,
married up and trained against the contingency that they might be
required.
5. The flooding of WALCHEREN ISLAND to the greatest possible extent
would not affect the difficulties of operation of airborne troops.
Intelligence sources state that thoroughly saturated ground is impassable
to infantry and therefore is equivalent to flooding from the point of view of
landing airborne infantry upon it.
6. I consider that the technique for the capture of WALCHEREN ISLAND
should be as follows:
123
(a) Bombing operations should be undertaken to break
the dykes and completely flood all parts of the island below high
water level.
(b) Those parts of the island which remain above water
should then be systematically attacked by heavy air bombardment,
day and night, to destroy defences and weed out the garrison by
attrition. RDF stations should have an early priority as point
targets.
(c) Whenever possible, heavy bombers proceeding to or
from targets in Western Germany by day or night should be routed
over WALCHEREN so that the garrison can never tell whether the
approach of large numbers of aircra",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ivision may be assigned independent missions
which require operations far from other troops It may
constitute part of a cavalry corps ; it may be assigned or attached
to a corps an army or group of armies or it may be
held in general headquarters reserve
â 056 Cavalry is most effectively employed in those areas
where the terrain is definitely unfavorable to the operation
of mechanized units or in areas known to be free of hostile
mechanized forces If employed in areas where hostile
mechanized forces are likely to be encountered the cavalry
division should be strongly reinforced by mechanized and
antimechanized means
057 The primary mission of Cavalry is combat The
mobility of the cavalry divison permits it to extend the scope
of operation of less mobile ground troops and secure freedom
of action for them In a war of movement cavalry is
employed initially for surprise thrusts into enemy territory
for reconnaissance and for screening and covering other
forces Thereafter its most effective employment is in large
groups for swift and decisive action Its main strength
must not be dissipated through indiscriminate detachments
nor sacrificed through prolonged performance of missions
which can be performed more satisfactorily by other arms
f 058 Cavalry ordinarily executes reconnaissance in cooperation
with aviation Aviation locates the enemy at a
distance and orients the ground reconnaissance elements
thereby conserving their energy and speeding up their execution
of reconnaissance
059 The cavalry division executes reconnaissance for
larger units in accordance with instructions from the higher
2 58
OPERATIONS
059- 060
commander These instructions include all pertinent information
about the enemy and friendly troops the missions
of the larger units the intentions of the higher commander
the mission of the cavalry division expressed in terms of the
information required the area to be reconnoitered and the
cooperation and coordination between the cavalry division
reconnaissance aviation and other reconnaissance agencies
The higher commander assigns to the cavalry division a
zone of reconnaissance which ordinarily does not exceed 25
to 30 miles in width The cavalry division commander redistributes
this zone to reconnaissance detachments varying
in strength and composition according to the enemy opposition
expected and the relative importance of their missions
In distributing forces for reconnaissance and in assigning
missions the division commander estimates the relative importance
of factors affecting the mission of the division and
assigns greater strength and a more aggressive mission to
detachments operating in decisive zones
The cavalry division commander indicates the general axes
or zones for reconnaissance detachments within the division
zone of action and the lines to be reached at designated times
by elements of the detachment The distance between the
reconnaissance detachments and the main body of the division
varies with the situation ; at times it may become several
days' march Reconnaissance detachments are not responsible
for the immediate security of the division This must be
provided by the detail of the necessary covering forces
When reconnaissance detachments are operating at considerable
distance from the division or when secrecy considerations
necessitate radio silence the establishment of
advance message centers will facilitate the forwarding of
information and reduce the burden on the reconnaissance
elements Under such circumstances the protection of the
advance or relay stations devolves upon the division
commander
When the distance between the main opposing forces is
so reduced that the mobility of the cavalry cannot be utilized
the division should be rapidly shifted and depending upon the
situation directed against the enemy flanks or rear disposed
to protect a flank or placed in reserve
â 060 A cavalry division protects the disposition and action
of other ground forces by counterreconnaissance or

screening which may be conducted either offensively or defensively
In executing a counterreconnaissance mission the
division seeks to defeat or neutralize enemy ground reconnaissance
forces
In the performance of counterreconnaissance the cavalry
division ascertains at the earliest practicable time the location
and activity of the enemy cavalry or other major ground
forces whose operations may jeopardize the main forces
A screening mission is most effectively accomplished by the
early defeat of the enemy ground reconnaissance forces The
dispositions of the division in offensive counterreconnaissance
are similar to those prescribed for reconnaissance Reconnaissance
detachments operate aggressively and locate the
main enemy forces to obtain information for the division
upon which it can base further operations In defensive
counterreconnaissance which is most effective when established
along a continuous obstacle patrols are pushed to the
front; and the division commander disposes his forces so as
to block the main routes of approach
When screening the concentration of large forces cavalry
divisions usually act defensively The screen utilizes available
obstacles to the maximum and is established at a sufficient
distance to the front to keep enemy ground reconnaissance
agencies from observing the location and disposition
of the forces being concentrated
â¢ 06 Large bodies of horse cavalry usually maneuver
mounted and fight dismounted Cavalry uses the mobility
of its horses to gain the advantage of surprise against the
hostile flanks and rear from which dismounted fire attacks
can be employed effectively and decisively
Terrain may be the controlling factor Where concealment
exists for a dismounted advance losses are minimized
Conversely where there is no concealment or cover a quick
mounted dash from a concealed line of departure often results
in fewer losses
Long mounted advances against troops in position and
mounted attacks against prepared positions or against troops
in position and able to employ their combat power effectively
should not be made
â¢
062 The dispositions of the cavalry division for attack
usually include a pivot of maneuver about which the comoan
OPERATIONS
062- 065
mand operates a maneuvering mass charged with the main
attack and a reserve
As soon as contact is foreseen the division endeavors to
secure points of observation and to deny them to the enemy
In a meeting engagement the advance guard establishes the
pivot of maneuver In a more deliberately prepared attack
a special force may be detailed to establish it The pivot
of maneuver engages the enemy's attention and pins him to
his position by a fire attack or by a combination of fire attack
and maneuver
The maneuvering mass contains the main offensive power
and often constitutes the greater part of the division The
division commander assigns to the leader of this fraction the
accomplishment of the vital offensive action and allows him
sufficient liberty of action to take full advantage of the
developments of the situation He informs him of the general
plan the mission of the maneuvering mass and the duties of
the other elements of the division He usually specifies the
general location and the route thereto from which the attack
of the maneuvering mass is to be launched
â¢ 063 The reserve is kept mounted or close to its horses
Its initial location depends upon its contemplated employment
The division commander uses the reserve promptly
to strike at a weak area in the hostile dispositions to push
through a success gained either by the pivot or the maneuvering
force or to pursue a defeated enemy Should the
attack fail the reserve may be employed to cover the reorganization
to assist in holding the position gained or in
occupying a rear position when a withdrawal follows
â¢ 064 When a cavalry division is to be employed in the
exploitation of a break-through it is moved to the vicinity
of the main effort of the attack which is expected to break
through the enemy's defenses The breach should be sufficiently
wide to enable the cavalry division to pass through
without receiving severe fire from the flanks The mission
assigned the division on clearing the breach is clear-cut
aggressive and should be relentlessly carried out
â¢ 065 When the cavalry division constitutes an encircling
force in pursuit it seeks to block the enemy retreat especially
at defiles and other critical areas ; it delivers attacks against
qRi
065- 069
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
the enemy flanks and carries out destruction on his lines of
retreat
â¢ 066 When the cavalry division is acting alone it seeks
to destroy the hostile retreating force by direct pressure and
encircling pursuit (See ch 9 )
â¢ 067 Cavalry divisions may be employed on the defensive
to seize and hold a position pending the arrival of other
forces to cover a withdrawal to delay the enemy's advance
or to fill a gap in the line of battle
068 Within the scope of its powers and limitations cavalry
operates in defensive combat the same as infantry
Due to organization and characteristics cavalry units
usually occupy comparatively broader fronts with less depth
than do corresponding infantry units
In defensive combat the position or area to be defended is
prepared for defense and occupied by a small proportion of
the available cavalry force consisting principally of horse
elements while the bulk of the command including the mechanized
elements by maneuver and threat or actual attack
endeavors to block or divert the enemy at a distance Even
when it is necessary for cavalry to defend a particular area or
position its best chance of success lies in initial dispositions in
advance of the final defense area In this manner inherent
mobility will be used to best advantage Against an enemy
strong in cavalry the division reserve should be large
â¢ 069 In executing missions of delay the cavalry division
employs defensive tactics offensive tactics or a combination
of the two consisting of frontal delay and flank attack
It avoids decisive combat
Every effort is made to surprise the enemy by the choice of
delaying positions and by the forms of action used
The maximum amount of time is gained by forcing the
enemy to reconnoiter maneuver and deploy
The delaying force checks the enemy by bold and aggressive
action mounted and dismounted
It usually withdraws before suffering serious loss unless its
missions require more determined resistance
Surprise attacks delivered over previously reconnoitered
ground on the heads of hostile columns as they emerge from
defiles woods or villages have excellent chance of success

SECTION IV
ARMORED DIVISION
ORGANIZATION
â¢ 070 The armored division is the basic large armored unit
of the combined arms It comprises troops of the essential
arms and services so organized and equipped as to make it
tactically and administratively a self-contained unit capable
to a considerable extent of independent action
â¢ 07 The armored division is a powerfully armed and
armored highly mobile force Its outstanding characteristics
are its battlefield mobility and its protected fire power
Other important characteristics are: extended radius of action;
shock power; logistical self-containment ; and great
sensitiveness to obstacles unfavorable terrain darkness and
weather
â¢ 072 The armored division is organized primarily to perform
missions that require great mobility and firepower It is
given decisive missions It is capable of engaging in all forms
of combat but its primary role is in offensive operations
against hostile rear areas
073 Two or more armored divisions may be organized
into an armored corps (See FM 00- 5 )
9 074 The armored division consists fundamentally of five
echelons: command reconnaissance striking support and
service The component arms and services are organized
equipped and trained to operate within the division framework
in accordance with their tactical role When operating
separately or as part of an armored corps the division is reinforced
by the attachment of such additional arms and
services and by the' support of such aviation as the mission
and situation demand
â¢ 075 The command echelon is organized and equipped for
great speed in the conduct of operations Plans must be simple
and flexible Rapidly changing situations require advance
planning preparation of terrain studies and close
contact with developments in forward areas in order to make
changes in the initial plan and expedite the announcement
of subsequent decisions and orders Maximum use is made of

standing operating procedure air liaison and special prearranged
signals
â¢ 076 The reconnaissance echelon performs ground reconnaissance
for the armored division If necessary it fights for
information It works in close cooperation with observation
aviation troops transported by air and supporting ground
units Its reconnaissance is characterized by fast bold aggressive
action and by prompt transmission of information
procured Success of armored operations depends largely on
prompt and aggressive exploitation of the results of reconnaissance
In many situations the reconnaissance echelon
seizes terrain objectives in advance of the division pending
the arrival of other elements Under certain conditions it
executes delaying missions During combat it may be assigned
reconnaissance or security missions or may be held
initially in division reserve to meet emergencies
â¢ 077 The striking echelon is the main attack force of the
armored division It consists of tank regiments reinforced
as the situation requires by other elements organic to the
division Reconnaissance and heavy weapons elements are
included in the tank organizations
â¢ 078 The support echelon consists of infantry carried in
armored vehicles It is reinforced by artillery and other
organic elements of the division in accordance with the
mission and tactical situation Its basic role is to support
closely the striking echelon by offensive or defensive action
A 079 The service echelon assures prompt supply evacuation
maintenance and administration of the division (See
FM 00- 0 )
â¢ 080 The artillery components are organized and equipped
to render immediate controlled fire support to the various
elements of the division Timely support is facilitated by the
organization and equipment of armored artillery and the
transmission of information by radio
Once the attack is in progress the speed of the striking
force may make its support by artillery impracticable Combat
aviation must take over and execute the missions assigned
to artillery in more slowly moving operations
QCA
OPERATIONS
08 - 086
â¢ 08 Engineer units facilitate the movement of the
armored division by removing or assisting in the passage of
obstacles and mine fields; by strengthening bridges ; and by
constructing repairing and maintaining crossings Demolitions
and natural and artificial obstacles are used to hinder
or canalize movements of hostile forces Engineers engage in
combat when necessary for the accomplishment of their
assigned work
â¢ 082 The signal troops of the armored division are organized
for the rapid establishment and maintenance of signal
communication Because of its speed radio is the principal
means used but all practicable means are provided Effective
signal communication between armored units and supporting
artillery and combat aviation is vital in armored
operations
â¢ 083 Combat aviation is employed against hostile aviation
to prevent air observation and attack of the division During
battle it is used for direct support of operations Its
missions include attacks on hostile command and supply
installations ; attacks on hostile reserves and formed bodies
of troops particularly hostile armored units ; attacks on
hostile antitank weapons artillery and other ground weapons ;
attacks on targets of opportunity and critical points in the
enemy position and the maintenance of air superiority in the
decisive areas
â¢ 084 Observation aviation performs command reconnaissance
observation liaison and signal commu:nication
missions and cooperates closely with the division reconnaissance
echelon Air observation of artillery fire is necessary
if fire is to be delivered on targets which cannot be observed
from the ground Observation aviation maintains effective
liaison and coordination between the tanks artillery and
combat aviation
â¢ 085 Troops transported by air may be employed in conjunction
with the operations of the armored division to land
in advance of it to secure terrain objectives on the routes of
march or to seize vital points in rear of the hostile front

operations
087 Attached chemical units are charged with the planning
execution and supervision of chemical operations They
are employed to supplement organic means of the division in
the execution of smoke missions during operations
RECONNAISSANCE
â¢ 088 Speed of movement of the division and of the enemy
requires air and ground reconnaissance forces to operate at
great distances from the main body The distance at which
air reconnaissance operates is never less than the operating
range of hostile armored forces These distances at which the
division reconnaissance battalions operate are influenced by
the imminence of contact with hostile ground forces and the
characteristics of these forces Reconnaissance agencies of
lower units search the area intervening between the division
reconnaissance battalion and the main body When the
threat of hostile air attack is present air reconnaissance includes
the known location of the threat and is extended to
such distance as will afford the division and supporting pursuit
aviation ample warning of an air attack
When necessary the air reconnaissance effort is supported
by combat aviation ; ground reconnaissance units of the division
are given such additional support from other elements of
the division as the situation and mission demand
â¢ 089 In conjunction with the execution of specific missions
all reconnaissance elements report information of terrain
roads signal communication facilities landing fields and supplies
observed Ground reconnaissance elements should include
engineer personnel whose mission is to determine the
condition of roads and bridges and furnish timely information
of any repairs or construction required Negative reports
must be submitted with the same promptness as is positive
information
SECURITY
â¢ 090 Security depends largely on the efficacy of concealment
of supporting combat aviation and antiaircraft artillery
and of ground security detachments in preventing
discovery in bivouac and during movement
266
OPERATIONS
Timely warning from far reaching aggressive air and
ground reconnaissance is vital to protection against surprise
Natural barriers with their crossings or passes destroyed
or blocked and defended provide a high degree of
ground protection with economy of force for both the division
and its lines of communication Camouflage dispersion
concealment and high speed in movement combined
with the aggressive employment of combat aviation and
antiaircraft weapons afford the best security against air
attack
i 09 Precautions and protection against attack principally
against air attack are stressed during periods of refueling
and maintenance Congestion must be avoided Maximum
use is made of concealment and cover
â 092 In cooperation with large forces security may be
provided initially by other troops so that the armored operations
may come as a complete surprise to the enemy During
subsequent operations the superior commander may prescribe
security measures to be performed by other troops
for the protection of the combat elements of the division
the mobile supply base and the lines of communication In
all situations columns or groupings of the division are responsible
for their own local security
093 Bridges over unfordable streams passes through
mountains and other defiles are seized in advance of the
main body and protected against both ground and air attack
Existing natural barriers paralleling the direction of advance
are used to establish protected corridors for security of the
division and its lines of communication
094 Usually security detachments for daylight movements
are composed of tank units reinforced by other arms During
night movements during extended periods of tank maintenance
and refueling 'or when terrain is occupied for protection
infantry and machine guns are the principal component
Security detachments for the movement are smaller and operate
at greater distances between elements than for cavalry
or foot divisions
095 During movement frontal security is normally performed
by column advance guards

Zones of responsibility are assigned by division to column
commanders
â¢ 096 During movement flank security is provided where
practicable by utilizing natural and artificial obstacles protected
by detachments and by flank guards detailed by
column commanders
â¢ 097 During long halts and in bivouac the division secures
itself principally by far reaching reconnaissance by skillful
use of terrain and natural and artificial barriers by depth of
disposition in the halt area by an outpost and by local security
measures In proximity to the enemy or behind the
enemy lines all around security is provided Infantry with
artillery antitank and engineer units constitutes the principal
element of the outpost
â¢ 098 The area selected for a halt to assemble reorganize
rest or refuel should permit rapid communication with reconnaissance
elements and should provide natural terrain barriers
to hostile attack particularly in the presence of hostile
armored units The halt area may be utilized as a base for
the continuance of operations
â¢ 099 Based on information received from its reconnaissance
and security agents the armored division dispatches troops
and combat aviation if available to destroy a known potential
hostile threat before that threat can become a real danger
to the division
MARCHES
â¢ 00 The armored division normally marches ip multiple
columns to facilitate readiness for action and protection
against hostile air and armored force attack In the presence
of hostile aviation secrecy surprise and protection are favored
by night marches When tactical considerations govern
march columns are constituted in accordance with the
probable employment of the striking and support echelons in
combat Mobility is exploited to achieve surprise

of darkness when the situation is obscure when the plan of
maneuver contemplates the commitment of the infantry prior
to the tanks and when the employment of the tanks cannot
be reasonably foreseen infantry is placed in the lead
OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS
â¢ 02 Tactical operations of the armored division are characterized
by bold maneuvers executed at high speed to create
a preponderance of power in the decisive area Combat action
is further characterized by the maximum coordination possible
initially followed by decentralization of means and reliance
upon the initiative of subordinates
Operations are predicated upon deliberate detailed planning
and rapid aggressive execution Completeness of plans
is limited only by the time available
The timely personal influence of the commander must be
exerted in all operations He must have at his disposal various
means of rapid transportation and signal communication
to enable him to exert this influence
â¢ 03 All armored force attacks contemplate the rapid
transfer of shock power and protected fire power into the
vital part of the hostile rear area from an unexpected direction
The attack is launched in mass in a decisive direction
with such speed and violence that the enemy is afforded no
time or opportunity to organize and 'coordinate his reaction
before the armored attack mission is accomplished Such
attacks produce early hostile demoralization and decisive
results
â¢ 04 The mobility of the armored division permits great
latitude in the choice of direction and method of attack
Whether the attack will be executed as a turning movement
envelopment or penetration will be largely determined by
the hostile dispositions and organization of the ground the
terrain the time factor and lines of communication within
the hostile area
â¢ 05 Four conditions should be present or be created for
successful offensive action : air superiority surprise favorable
terrain and the absence or neutralization of massed enemy
defensive means

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
06 In order to obtain surprise all preparatory movements
are carefully concealed and measures are taken to prevent
hostile ground and air observation of the division The
mobility of the armored division is exploited to keep the enemy
in doubt as long as possible as to the area of its employment
Radio often is silenced prior to the attack After the attack
is launched the element of surprise may be retained by sustained
speed and power
5 07 Areas favorable for attack are determined from the
information obtained by map study from reconnaissance
agencies from higher and adjacent units and from troops
already in contact with the enemy
Armored units can be employed on comparatively rough
terrain Localities with heavy timber high boulders and
stumps steep slopes marshes deep or muddy bottom streams
and streams with abrupt banks are however obstacles to
armored vehicle operations Defended towns or cities are
avoided
08 Ground antitank measures include natural and artificial
obstacles demolitions strongly organized localities
mine fields antitank weapons artillery and armored units
The attack is planned so as to neutralize blind or overcome
the hostile antitank defenses in the zone of attack and to
strike at defensive weakness
â¢ 09 In attack the combat elements of the armored division
generally are disposed into three parts : a striking
force (striking echelon) a supporting force (support echelon)
and a reserve
â¢ 0 When the initial terrain is unfavorable for tank operations
or when hostile antitank defenses are strong the
support echelon of the armored division may attack in advance
of the striking force to secure ground favorable for
the initiation of the tank attack If operating in close cooperation
with other troops the entire armored division
may be held out until the difficult zone has been taken by
other troops or has been disrupted by artillery and air attack
When conditions permit the striking echelon to lead the
attack the support echelon follows the striking force to occupy
and hold objectives seized by the striking force

units34 The armored division may be employed to exploit itsown success and the successes of other troops by rapid attacksfrom the rear to overrun the hostile artillery to destroy reserves and command and supply establishments to break uphostile counterattacks and to block strong reserves moving torestore the battle position or to occupy rear positionsn35 In exploiting a break-through the armored division iseffectively employed to operate at great distances in thehostile rear areas to block routes of hostile movement toattack strategic reserves and to seize vital areas In suchoperations the division normally constitutes a part of alarger armored force which is closely followed by other mobileunits such as motorized divisions Since the purpose of theseoperations is the complete destruction of the enemy by placing a powerful striking force in his rear the division movesthrough the area of the break-through at the greatest possible speed Troops transported by air may be suitably employed in advance of the armored divisions Opportunities fordecisive exploitation by armored forces must be created36 Before directing exploitation or pursuit the commander of the armored division must assure the required		36-4OPERATIONS4 -44FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONSsupply of ammunition and motor fuel in combat elementsHis plan must include provision for both supply and motormaintenance during the subsequent operationsNormallylittle dependence should be placed on procuring motor fuellocallyIt37 Once undertaken pursuit must be boldly pushedwith the utmost vigor and ruthlessness Acting alone thedivision organizes all combat elements for pursuit by directpressure and by encirclement A strong encircling force isprovided The tank units with the direct pressure force seekto pass through gaps which the attack may have opened inthe hostile dispositions or to gain the rear of the enemy'scovering force in order to attack the withdrawing hostileelements The encircling force moves to strike the headsof the retreating columns by placing itself across the line ofretreat on terrain favorable for its operationi38 In a pursuit when operating with large forces thearmored division reinforced with highly mobile units is normally employed as an encircling force39 In all pursuit operations combat aviation acting inconjunction with the pursuing armored units materially assists in obtaining decisive resultsobstacles The tank units prepare plans for counterattacksand for ambush against hostile tank units42 When the terrain is favorable the armored divisioneither alone or in cooperation with other forces may be employed in counterattack The characteristics of the armoreddivision may justify assigning it objectives considerablydeeper or further to a flank than those whose capture wouldbe necessary merely to restore the defensive position43 When a large force reinforced by armored divisionspasses from the defensive to the offensive the armored divisions may be employed rapidly to envelop a hostile flank orto form the spearhead of a penetration of a weak portionof the hostile front044 In delaying action against less mobile forces thesupport echelon operates against the heads of the advancingenemy units while the tanks threaten or attack the hostileflanks and rear Against hostile armored troops every effortis made to locate each delaying position behind a formidablenatural obstacle Tank units protect the flanks and executelocal counterattacksDEFENSIVE OPERATIONS40 The employment of the armored division on a defensive position seriously restricts the use of its mobility andshould be resorted to only in emergencyA4 Opposed to greatly superior armored forces the division avoids decisive combat if its mission permits such action If its mission requires it to gain time it either occupies terrain unfavorable for hostile tank attacks or employsdelaying tactics When a position must be defended by thedivision against superior hostile armored troops every advantage is taken of obstacles to protect the position andrestrict the direction of the hostile attackThe position selected should afford room for maneuversuitable terrain for counterattacks and concealed routes ofwithdrawalThe units of the support echelon organize defense areas disposed in depth so as to take full advantage of277276	5FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONSWhen tanks are employed in an attack intensive reconnaissance to discover antimechanized defenses must beinitiated promptly and must be continued throughout thetank actionWhen necessary engineer troops with suitable

to bear in defense . The habit of attacking
all along the line must be avoided,
d. The concentration of artillery fire. is ..a
prerequisite to success. On ' , battalion - of

displace, must be made sufficiently early to
prevent confusion during the movement, All r
units, must be informed as to the probable
location if a, displacement is contemplated .
An axis is not sufficient for the command
posts of elements that are engaged.
22. Armored forces in the defensive.
a., Armored .forces are' not . designed or
organized for' static defense . Their primary.,
purpose and tactical principle is offensivee
action..' -'Armored units defend by counter-
'atta'cking' at the right, time and the right
place to . disrupt and disorganize hostile attack.
b. General defensive principles applicable
to armor as well as to other arms have been .
thus summarized in an armored regimental,
commander's report of battle experience :
Armored units must learn to apply
the principle' of being strong at
the r}-ght spot and of avoiding attempts
at holding everywhere at the same
time. - It is better to give ground in
order to attack and defeat the enemy
in detail, . than to disperse strength by
trying -to ,watch every place that the
enemy might slip through . The armored
division has great possibilities
43
i
1
In similar tone, the commander, of an 'ar
mored regiment commented on 'the same
point in his report
. Tank operations must ' be conducted
on a perfected plan to be successful.
It is better to delay â the
attack than to rush in to reach : a certain
objective by a certain time, without
sufficient, orders to subordinates or
sufficient rconnaissance. E n o u g h
time should be granted to make certain
that every subordinate commander
knows and understands the plan, the '
mission, adjacent troops, and the rally .
points . One of the most successful attacks
ever made by an organization of
this regiment was at HILL 609 . It
achieved its high degree of success because
all commanders concerned appreciated
the fact that \the German and
not time, was the enemy . .
f . The, assembly area for an armored attack
must provide concealment from hostile
ground observation . Where terrain, makes -
this impossible, the delay in the assembly
area' must be brief .
g . The command post must be well forward
in attack. When ordered to move, it
must displace quickly, and the decision to

with, the tank destroyer' elements ; 'part of the
armshoouldr, ,be : established ;in carefully
chosen ground in,hull-down position to check'
the advance of, enemy tanks with defensive,
fri,re. b. Tanks should never be kept,in the battle
zone when not' being actively employed, especially
during lulls or quiet periods . The
armor, ; must withdraw s from combat ; at, or
prior to , darkness, and be'' taken well back
to refit and. rearm;: Unnecessary holding' oÂ£
tanks for several days in the front line mate-_
rially reduces their effective fighting strength
through; lack of maintenance..
When, armored forces are held for counterattack
purposes, they must be far enough
back, to permit' freedom of choice, of action,
even at the expense of loss of terrain . The. .
tanks must be kept concealed, and their movement
must be . as secret' as possible. To do
otherwise : will permit the enemy to count our
strength and match it, thus making our-counterattack'ineffective
.
d. Armored ; artillery is superior to towed
artillery in retrograde' movements . Its armor,

to cover the withdrawal of foot elements .: : It <
can protect ;,itself reasonably, well against in

as a mobile reserve for rapid dispatch
to a threatened, spot to , crush hostile
attack by strong counterattack
c. Appreciation of terrain is of special'
importance in defensive action. : . Gr o u n d
which is valuable for . offense may become
worthless for defense . Commanders' should
not hesitate to abandon unsuitable ground
when the mission changes from offense to de-w=
f ense .
d. The necessity for clarity in instructions;'
especially for defensive missions, was .,thus''
reported by an armored regimental : com
mander
. , A mission ""you will prevent the
debauchment of the enemy' through .
such and such a place"" is incomplete' '
in that there ' is no limiting time factor ;
If the defender knows that he is to
""hold at all costs,"" his plan will be
different from that which contemplates'
holding until reinforced, or until some
other action is ordered , . .
23. Armored forces in retrograde, move-'
ments .
a. In retrograde movements, armored forces,
should be employed on the flanks to counterattack
the hostile pursuit . In 'cooperation
44
I
filtration during daylight, and it can in emer-""
gency provide protection against ' hostile
armored attack.
24. Armored infantry units.
a . The primary mission of the armored in
f antry is to assist, cooperate with, and fight'
in coordination with the armored elements of
the division. When occasion requires, armored
infantry fights as ordinary infantry,
and many of the lessons and experiences given
in Section II above, are applicable to the infantry
of the armored division . Such subjects
as fire and movement, scouting and patrolling,
observation, preparation for counterattack,
consolidation of captured ground,
depth in offense and defense, apply to all
infantry, whether armored or not .
b . The outstanding lesson with regard to
armored infantry is the prime necessity of
following up the advantage or gains achieved
by the tanks . Reports have shown that on a
number of occasions the supporting infantry
did not follow up and consolidate the ground
initially taken by the assaulting tanks.
Armored vehicles cannot hold ground indefinitely
after they have made their penetration
or have gained a position . If the
armored infantry .' do not `follow: quickly and'
.occupy, the ground gained by the armor, the
tanks ill eventually . be forced to withdraw,
and the potentially successful operation be-
.Comes , unsuccessful . The comments of the
commander of one of the armored combat
commands in' his report indicate that this
situation, prevailed in four major actions-
`pat TEBOURBA in December, OUSSELTIA
in February, KASSERINE in March, and at
MAKNASSY in April.""
c.'' The tactical situation in each case must
determine the exact manner of employment
of armored infantry . Whether it will precede
the' tanks and prepare the way for their
thrust, whether. it will follow in the wake of
the armor and exploit and consolidate the
gains, 'or, whether a combination ''of both will
'be used-all depend on the nature of the objective,
the terrain, and the situation in
general.
d. One function important in the action of
armored ,infantry is the stalking and silencing
of antitank weapons, locating them and relaying
their positions to the artillery, and' in
general, serving as a means of eliminating this
threathet, 'atdvaoncging armor . ""Experience
has,. proven,"" , .wrote- the- commander of one
47 '
5
of the combat commands, 'at least, in ttie
Tunisian Campaign, that the antitank gun 'is ,
to be avoided (by . advancing tanks), as much . ;'
as possible, and attacked only as a last re-,'
sort."" The skillful use of determined , infantry,
supported by artillery, to locate, and
attack these guns will make for success of the''
armored elements. ,
25. Armored field artillery units,
a. Armored field artillery :'is generally,
capable of being employed',in a manner, .simr
larr to that of ordinary' artillery, and the :'
lessons and experience relating to' division,
field artillery in section III also apply to the
artillery of an armored division . In addition;'
armored field artillery: possesses the character;.
istics of mobility and maneuverability in . .
somewhat higher degree than in the 'caseÂ°'of
ordinary towed artillery . It, must be aggres .
sively used at all times in offense, and because
of its armored, self-propelled carriages it can
be placed well forward in support. The loca- -
tion and disposition of enemy,, installations
govern' how far forward armored . artillery .
should be placed. It 'should be gut of ,range .
of heavy machine 'gun fire and light mortar
fire, and it should seek position defiladed from
48
f
t
fiat-trajectory antitank, weapons. ' 'Its'' positions'
should ;afford a reasonably well' defiladed
approach,;;for ammunition ,vehicles which ,are
not armored :
b ; In defensive situations, armored artillery
has' been, found to possess certain ; advantages
over towed-''artillery, and -'also'' disadvantages
not,: presenti in the latter. Because . of its
armor .it-'can, remain longer m forward areas
and covetrhee'withdrawal''of other troops, and .'
can , be ~! used -to 'protect withdrawing forces
against.'hostile , armor , ins' emergency . t ,a so

`tactics and ;training, taken' from the reports
of armored:';field artillery battalion commanderg,'
are included in addition to' the material
contained'in' Section III;- above :',,

k5J
Firing data should, be computed
for all' avenues of approach to the position
immediately, after it is occupied .
(6) Dispersion within the battery position
cannot be too much stressed, The battery
front should approach 250 yards.
(7) Armored artillery is essentially
support, artillery. It should be employed for
direct fire only in case .its own positions are
attacked.
(8) Each member of the gun crew
should; be trained in the duties of all other
j
members, from the chief of section 'to the
ammunition' handler. All members of the
crew,, must be able to drive .
`` ~;
.(9) More attention must be given to

SECTION V-TANK DESTROYER UNITS""'
27. Experience in the Tunisian Campaign
reveals that some of the fundamental princi
pies prescribed in training literature have
been misinterpreted. The main lesson from
the campaign resulted from misconception of,
the idea of ""offensive action."" Destroyers
must not be used to ""hunt tanks ."" Neither
can they be used as tanks in a fire fight with*
tanks without disastrous losses.
28. The campaign has demonstrated that the
maneuver of tank destroyers largely depends
on the existence of concealed routes of ap
proach, and on the degree of enemy observa=
tion from both observation posts and direct
firing antitank guns. The concept of ""seek,
strike, and destroy"" must be modified to meet :
existing conditions and the capabilities and
limitations of the destroyers as applied,
to the situation and mission. This idea of
aggressive action must also be applied' to
units and not to single vehicles or small
groups of vehicles. As stated by the' 'com
mander of the destroyer group which partic
ipated in the campaign, ""an indavidzwl .
destroyer has not the means to, accomplish
vigorous reconnaissance to locate hostile
56
tanks."" Likewise experience has shown that -
tank destroyers, unless in coordination with
other arms, .,can seldom strike, at vital object
ives; The ..: best method of employment in
the campaign was found to be that of establishing
abase, of fire and giving close direct,
support to other antitank elements from hull
'down . positions . 'Destroyers must'' not chase'
tanks. "" They, .. 'should reconnoiter for . ,the',
approach, of enemy' :,.tank formations and' be
prepared t6:-; meet . them with defensive fire
from selected,hull-down`positions, Every ef=.
fort -must be' : made to establish tank traps into
which the ; .hostile; tanks . may, be drawn and
destroyed, .;;..
29. Attached tank destroyers should not be
employed in the role of static antitank guns
Occupying,hull-down positions for defensive
fire' does not' imply restriction of movement
to avoid artillery fire, to occupy alternate,
supplementary, or cover positions, or ' on
change , of location : when advantage may be
gained. .
30. 'Destroyers -must be used . in ' numbers.
.The tendency. of . some commanders of larger
units to,which TD -battalions have been at
tithed, in attaching companies, platoons, or
even sections to small task forces should be
discouraged. The battalion is the most ' of-'
fective unit in action . Piecemeal employment
is to be avoided the same as in armored forces .
31. Campaign experience has shown that
tank destroyer units in addition to their primary
role, can be profitably employed on
special missions when it is known that there
is no threat from enemy armor. These operations
included such missions as reconnaissance
in force, advance guard for special combat
forces, artillery support, and mine and
booby trap removal . All these missions were
performed successfully, and indicate the versatile
possibilities of the organizations - in
addition to their primary mission . It must
be emphasized that these special operations
were undertaken only at times when there was
known to be no impending threat from hostile
armor .
32 . Fighting in Tunisia has clearly indicated
the necessity of sound training in mine warfare
and booby trap clearing for tank . destroyer
units . Destroyers must often operate
in areas that have been mined and booby
trapped, and must frequently carry out operations
without assistance from engineers . In
58
establishing tank traps, destroyer units must
be capable of using mines offensively .
33. Effective camouflage, concealment, and
the use of cover are vital to successful destroyer
operations . Combinations of such
measures as coloring vehicles with soil, mud,
paint and other, media ; nets and other artificial
methods ; and the use of brush, debris,
and foliage have all been successfully used
in the recent campaign. The use of draws,
swales, hillocks, . natural folds, haystacks, and
even buildings for concealment and cover has
been found highly effective in the terrain
encountered.
34. The reporting commanders have stressed
reconnaissance as a never-ending function of
tank destroyer units . Reconnaissance for
ready, fire, alternate, supplementary, and
rally positions must be made before an action .
Alternate plans of action also require recon-,
naissance before such plans can be completed.
Commanders, at least down to platoon leaders,
'should 'reconnoiter the ground into which
they are to operate . Tank, destroyer units
should not be given missions properly belonging
to the reconnaissance troops or
battalions of divisions and corps . Their
reconnaissance fi4nctions shouldd be limit6d't
their own operations.
SECTION VI.-MINE WARFARE AND~,
B0 _BY TRAPS
35. Experience in the Tunisian Campaign
showed that. mine warfare has assumed far
greater tactical importance than had been
previously realized or anticipated. As d6-
Moped in the present war, the land mine and
the various types of booby traps have proved
'to be a most formidable and powerful weapon
and serious obstacle in the advance and operations
of all arms . Much has been learned
from the recent campaign, and this experience
should be utilized to every advantage in future
operations, especially in those conducted by
troops who have not yet entered action .
36, The most outstanding lesson derive&,i' .
.
from the campaign has been the realization
and understanding that detecting, , disarming,
and clearing mines and booby traps is no.
longer a special or exclusive function' of the
engineers . Although these operations are
primary functions of engineer troops , and
have expanded with the current developments .
in the war, it has been learned by experience
A=
that troops 'of all arms must be proficient' in
~ mine -warfare. , , In' many'` instances infantry'
, artillery, - and other organizations must take
.
care `of the mine problem 'in their own areas,
since' it often , becomes , impossible for , engineer
troops to cover every area where mines
have been laid.
1 37. Exposure to mines and booby,traps in the
numbers encountered in the recent campaign
necessitates the distribution of mine detectors
to all arms . ,, The general experience
of the infantry ,, divisions has led to their
recommendation 'for the allotment of one to
two detectors' per company, battery, . or troop.
Each unifof this, size must have from its own
.:personnel a squad or section fully , capable of
using the detector and clearing mines . Detecting
and clearing, as well as minelaying,
i s of. special importance to the reconnaissance
units of divisions and corps,
38. In ' forward areas where exposure to
,mines maybe expected,, all vehicles of lesser
weight than the standard 2Y2-ton truck should
be sandbagged . Experience has shown that
sandbags, while they do not prevent : damage
to vehicles, â¢have : often saved'. the lives of
personnel .
39. The dissemination of information con- ,
cerning mines, minefields, and booby-trapped
areas is of utmost importance to the safety
of a command. It is the duty of all headquarters
to see that information of this 'nature
reaches all echelons without delay . As
stated by one division commander,
A great many casualties suffered
by this Division through loss of personnel
and materiel by mines could
have been avoided had this information ,
been furnished everyone concerned .
40. Common German practice is to mine the
shoulders of roads, and seemingly unused
roads, tracks, or trails . Mines are also sown
freely throughout country suitable for mechanized
approach. Rough terrain not traversed
by paths or trails has generally been
found relatively free from mines. Road
craters,, blown culverts and the approaches to'
by-passes around blown bridges are generally,
heavily mined . The enemy has also created
effective delaying barriers by mining soft and,
sandy fords and by strewing them with metal
fragments to render detectors , ineffective . .,
The sporadic mining of long stretches of road
has been found to be another German method
of delaying advance .
62
41. The instruction and training principles
developed to combat mine warfare have
proved highly effective and sound . The mine.'
clearing drill developed in the Libyan Campaign
and further developed to meet the requirements
of all types of terrain has proved
entirely' satisfactory . Mastery of the mine
clearing, drill, understanding of all types and
combinations of mines, and confidence on the
part of personnel will serve to neutralize
the casualty effect of mine warfare . Nothing
effective as yet has been fully developed to
remove the delaying effect. The majority of
casualties from clearing operations have been
the result of violations of clearing drill teachings,
such as unnecessary movement in suspicious
areas, congregating in groups during
removal operations, improper detector swinging,
and lack of proper or orderly procedure
in clearing projects .
42. The commander of the armored division
participating' in the campaign has frankly
stated that
The antitank mine is one of the
greatest menaces to the operations of
-the , armored division. The antitank
mine has no present antidote except the

arms- were subjected'to air attack under various
conditions,' The experience of different
unit's'and' arms -varied considerably .' In one

slow process of picking up 'the : mines .,
by the use of detectors, of charging'
through the minefields at great loss of
tanks.
43. Mine warfare in its offensive phase has
been as important as defensive . . measures.
The minefield has . become a powerful' sec
ondary weapon, and its use must be thoroughly
understood. The following points
have been emphasized in the reports of'combat
experience :
a. Standardization of minefield markings, .
routes, and reports is absolutely essential .
It has been reported that at times our own
minefields have proved to be ""more, disas
trous than those of the enemy."" Troops of
all arms must be able to recognize standard
markings, and must maintain strict compli -
ance with minefi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"air reconnaissance, and by
keeping the enemy ignorant, they contribute to surprise ;
also, night marches bring troops into position for battle
with fewer losses and consequently higher morale .
In spite of the fact that main highways are often illuminated
with flares by hostile aviators, it is frequently
necessary to utilize highways for marches . If many alternative
parallel routes are available, the principal highways
are avoided, or utilized by motor elements only .
The hour of assembly at the beginning of the march
should come after dark in order to preclude observation
by hostile planes . Troops are formed as for a day march
without extension of distance or expansion of width for
air defense ; but the security forces are drawn in somewhat
38
GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
closer, and distances between units are slightly increased
to insure sufficient buffer room . Double connecting
files, sent by the principal unit to the subordinate unit,
or from the rear unit to the forward unit, are liberally
used to maintain contact . The order of march is similar
to the arrangement for a day march . If the tactical
situation permits, -fa'ot troops precede the mounted troops .
On good roads and by starlight or moonlight, the rate of
march is practically the same as that of a day march .
On poor roads or in heavy darkness, the rate decreases to
3 kilometers (just under 2 miles) per hour and even less .
Bicycle troops and motorized units also march appreciably
slower by night than by day . It is advisable to arrange
short rests-about 10 minutes in every hour ; long rest
periods tend to make the troops sleepy .
The alert commander does not march his troops directly
into bivouac if daylight is about to arrive . He halts
them in an available covered area and arranges to have
them divided into small groups before the troops march on
to bivouac or other destination .
41 . DAY MAR HES
When contact with the enemy is at all possible, the
commander must march his command during the day
with ""preparedness for combat"" as the foremost consideration
. When contact with the enemy is not imminent,
the commander can divide his command and march
the various units on several routes . When time is not
pressing, the movement also can be carried out in small
groups over long periods of time . In any case, the first
consideration in a day march is tactical ; but the possibilities
of cover should not be overlooked . The stronger
MAR HES 39
columns should be marched over the routes offering the
most cover, while the weaker can be sent over the more
open routes . The time of departure on a day march is
.influenced by the situation, the weather, the season, the
length of the intended march, the condition of the troops,
and other factors . It is desirable to march from an old
bivouac area under cover of darkness and reach a new
one by daylight .
42 . ORGANIZATION FOR MAR HING
Infantry marches in columns of three men abreast,
cavalry marches in columns of two abreast (exceptionally
four), and motor vehicles travel in single columns, In
general the right side of the road is used ; but when organizations
are mixed, the infantry should be permitted to
march on the more comfortable side for walking . Within
the infantry division, the commander must organize his
troops for the march so that he can bring all of them to
bear against the enemy, in a concerted attack in a single
day. In order to accomplish this, it may be necessary to
march in two, three, or four columns, with each column
providing its own security . Examples are illustrated by
the following diagrams :

and there are no adjacent units)

or under circumstances, where visibility is restricted,
arrangements for continuous connection are intensified .
On a march in several columns, communication between

available nteans. 1 e
44. RATES OF MAR H
Since it is important to provide conditions which permit
an even rate of march, the mixing of different sorts of
troops should be avoided as much as possible .'7 On good
roads and under favorable conditions the following

(when secrecy does not preclude its use), ray lamps, liaison offlccrs (through
the messenger system), wire telephone and telegraph (when contact with the
enemy is imminent), blinker (frequently), and signal flags (soldnm)11 Pack animals are one disturbing factor in waiulaining an ecru rate of
march,
1 8 For foot troops under ordinary conditions the distance prescrihod as a
""buffer"" between companies, or similar units, is 10 paces for mounted u â¢oops
and trains, 15 paces . Such distances do not apply, of course, whoa air defense
depth hays been ordered .
42 GERMAN TA TI AL Do 'rRInE
Intense heat, poor roads, snow, ice, absence of bridges,
and other local conditions greatly influence the march
rate and the travel distance accomplished . The rate for
foot troops on a cross-country or mountainous march
decreases from the normal hourly rate by as much as 2
or 3 kilometers.
When great-distances must be covered rapidly, motor
and rail transportation can be used to expedite marches ;
for distances under 150 kilometers (93 miles) the use of
motor transportation is recommended . When circumstances
require foot or mounted troops to make forced
marches, every effort is made to assist the accomplishment .
Strict march discipline is preserved, and severe measures
are meted out against malingerers . The men are told why
the particular march is being made, and arrangements are
made for rests where refreshments such as hot coffee or
tea will be served . Their packs are carried, if possible, in
trains .
45 . MAR H RESTS
The commander should indicate in the march order all
the necessary information concerning the duration and
other conditions of the march . An officer should be sent
forward to reconnoiter suitable areas for rests . Arrangements
should be made for a short halt, not longer than
15 minutes, to begin after the troops have marched about
2 kilometers (1 14 miles) so that equipment and clothing
may be comfortably readjusted on the men and animals .
The troops remain near the road during such short periods,
spreading out only a sufficient distance to secure cover
from hostile air observation . When a long march is made,
halts are ordered about every 2 hours . Rest periods are
11AR H,1'.,,,S
43
utilized for eating, drinking, feeding animals, and checking
vehicles, The stopping places should be near water
and not too restricted . In summer a rest should be prescribed
during the hottest time of the day. During long
rest periods the troops are arranged in groups ; and when
hostile airplanes approach, the air guards sound the warning
and the troops take cover, remaining motionless,
46. MAR H OUTPOSTS
The security of a force in a rest area is obtained by careful
preparation within the area and by sending out security
forces instructed to conduct reconilaissances, these
cautions being exercised in order to prevent the enemy
from obtaining information about the main force, and ill
order to protect the main force from surprise and give it
time to prepare for combat . According to the degree of
danger, if far from the enemy, simpler precautions may be
taken ; but since the effect of distance has been greatly
reduced by motorization and air operations, the following
principles of outposting should apply :
(a) Employ the minimum number of troops consistent
with the situation . (b) Exploit the natural protective
features of the terrain, particularly if the enemy is liable
to employ armored vehicles ; always establish road !)locks .
(c) By day, maintain observers in points of vantage for
distant viewing of the surrounding terrain . (d) By night,
maintain listening points and patrols on or near all possible
avenues of approach . (e) Provide protection for the
flanks and rear. (f) Establish air guards and a warning
system.
Section XI. VARIOUS TYPES OF BATTLE
The most important types of battle are the attack, the
defense, and the withdrawal, or retreat . A combination
of these types occurs simultaneously or successively in the
course of every major campaign . The commander and
the General Staff Officer must master the fundamental
principles involved in these various forms of tactical
maneuver. Resolute application of these principles may
penetrate, at least will help to neutralize, the ever-present
""fog of war.""
44
Section XII . THE ATTA K
The attack may be launched (a) from one direction
against front, flank, or rear ; (b) from several directions
simultaneously ; (c) after penetration, into a new direction .
47. FORMS OF ATTA K
The frontal attack is the most frequent form of attack,
but mechanized and motorized weapons will decrease this
frequency . It requires superiority in strength and produces
decisive results only when the hostile front is
penetrated .
The enveloping attack (envelopment) is the most effective
form of maneuver, and if aggressively employed deep
in the hostile flank or rear, it can result in a most decisive
victory, or even annihilation of the enemy . An envelopment
of both flanks presumes marked superiority in means .
Wide envelopments are more effective than close-in .
Among the factors that contribute to successful envelopments
are deception, concentration of strength at the
critical point, available reserves, mobility, and simplicity
of maneuver. As to surprise, the enemy mist not be
given the time necessary to take countermeasures . As
to mass, strength must be concentrated on the flank of the
envelopment so that hostile extension of the line can be
overrun or circumvented, and hostile defensive moves
quickly and effectively frustrated . As to Jixing the enemy,
45
46 GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
the hostile forces- in the front must be contained
simultaneously with the enveloping attack .""
The penetration is an attack where the maneuver is
intended to split or separate the hostile line of resistance .
The following considerations contribute to success : selection
of a favorable point (a weak part of the enemy position,
or favorable-terrain) ; surprise (such as feints at other
points, or secrecy in concentration of strength) ; breadth of
penetration (preferable a base as wide as the depth of
the penetration or wider) ; depth in organization (to
exploit breaking through, and to check hostile counterattacks)
; rapid and full exploitation of the break-through .
The limited objective attack is a form of maneuver intended
to win important terrain features, to contain the
enemy frontally, or to stop the hostile advance . Organization
in depth is not required .
48. ONSIDERATIONS FOR AN ATTA K
Some important general considerations for an attack are
the following : (a) Obtain unity of command and action ;
avoid piecemeal attacks . (b) Establish a main effort .
(c) Assign narrow zones of action . (d) Reinforce fire by
additional artillery and heavy infantry weapons. (e)
oordinate and intensify the fire of all weapons . (f)
Make timely employment of tanks and reserves . (g)
Exploit successes quickly and fully even though the
location of the main effort may properly have to be
io This may be accomplished by point attack (which is both effective, and
economical in troops), by frontal attack (which involves employment of
considerable force and thereby reduces the troops available for the main
effort), and by attack with limited objective (which requires a smaller force
and releases more troops for the main effort) .
THE ATTA K 4
changed .GÂ° (h) Recognize the crisis in a battle and react
appropriately .
Be alert to every advantage, to each success no matter
how small, to any mistakes made by the enemy-and
exploit these to the fullest degree, If the attack appears
definitely stopped by strong hostile resistance at a certain
point, further success may be better accomplished by
injecting fresh troops, by concentrating fires on a different
area, or by changing the disposition of troops .
49. ME HANI S OF ATTA K
The width of a zone of action is dependent upon terrain
and mission . A battalion of infantry with both flanks
protected is assigned a zone of action 400 to 1,000 meters
(roughly 440 to 1,100 yards) wide. An infantry division
in a meeting engagement where terrain is favorable for
employment of supporting weapons, is assigned a zone of
action 4,000 to 5,000 meters (4,400 to 5,500 yards) wide ;
but an infantry division having both flanks protected and
making the main effort against a strong hostile position is
assigned a zone of action of 3,000 meters (3,281 yards) .
A definite objective or direction must be indicated for
the attack. Although zones of action are prescribed, they
need not be completely filled with troops . For divisions
and larger units, these zones are selected from the map ;
for the smaller units, they are determined by inspection of
the terrain itself. The boundaries are extended deep
enough into hostile territory to preclude mixing of units
for the duration of the day's operation . Strongpoints and
10 For example, in passing an obstacle-river or mountain chain-the main
effort many be switched during the progress of the operation bereuso of a
break-through in an unexpected point .
48 GDRIViAN TA TI AL TDRIONE
difficult terrain must be included within a unit's zone of
action and not located on its boundary line . Frequently
only the designation of an objective is required in order to
maintain direction and to preclude mixing of organizations
.
Do not include too much detail in the attack order and
thus restrict in tiati,ve . The mission must be clear-what
to do, but not how to do it .
The important task of all weapons is to enable the
infantry to close with the enemy and to drive deep into his
position in order to crush all resistance or to annihilate him .
This end can be accomplished only if the hostile automatic
weapons and artillery are neutralized or destroyed . oordination
between infantry and artillery must at all times
and in all situations be carefully arranged.
When tanks and infantry are operating together, they
both should be initially assigned the same objective,
namely, the hostile artillery . Tanks can often attack
from a different direction . The coordination of other
weapons of the division attacking with tanks is based on
the activities of the latter, The division commander is
responsible for such coordination . Artillery supports the
tank attack by firing upon antitank weapons, blinding
hostile observation, and neutralizing villages and edges of
woods . Artillery fire must be carefully observed and controlled
to preclude firing upon friendly tanks and advancing
troops. Engineer troops remove tank obstacles and
assist tank units forward . The air force provides connection
between the fast-moving tank units, the division,
and the artillery . ombat aviation may be employed to
neutralize antitank weapons .
Antiaircraft troops protect the deployment of troops,
'fu: ATTA K 4IJ
positions of readiness, artillery positions, and battle
reconnaissance planes . The main effort must receive the
bulk of antiaircraft protection . Gas may be used against
artillery and reserves, and in connection with road blocks
or blockades on an open flank . The communications net
will be based upon the plan of maneuver ; separate nets
for artillery and infantry will be established, the artillery
net having priority .
50 . ATTA KING A POSITION
The plan of attack will be determined by the situation,
the morale of the enemy, and the extent of his defensive
works. Approach to the hostile position may be possible
only under cover of darkness . If the position cannot be
turned or enveloped, then a penetration must be made
through some point in the front . The employment of
inadequate force and means leads to severe reverses .
areful plans for the attack must include the necessary
information about the enemy and the terrain 21 Thorough
reconnaissance must be conducted by the officers of all
arms, but reconnaissance parties must be kept restricted
in size. Air reconnaissance is of particular value . Observation
and listening posts must be established . Limitedobjective
attacks, strong combat patrols, and similar
methods may be necessary to gain the information desired
.
The location of the main effort will be determined by
friendly intentions, the situation, the defensive strength
21 The following points should be clarified : Where are the eneun's advanced
positions, outpost lines, main line of resistance, switch positions,
reserves, and observation posts? Where does the terrain favor the approach
and the attack? Where has the enenIV employed gas and obstacles?
50 GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
of the hostile position, the covered approaches, and the
observation for supporting weapons, particularly the
artillery. In selecting a place for a penetration or breakthrough,
consider the following points :
(a) Find out how the attack can be further developed
after the initial break-through . (b) Insure sufficient room
for maneuver . (e~'Avoid natural strongpoints or envelop
them . (d) Locate favorable terrain for the employment
of tanks. (e) apture points or areas that will give
good observation deep into hostile positions . (f) Designate
close or far-distant objectives according to the size
of the attacking unit : if the final objective cannot be
reached in one advance, designate intermediate objectives
involving in some cases limited-objective attacks .
51 . ARTILLERY EMPLOYMENT
Under the protection of advance infantry units, the
artillery will be brought forward. Prompt reconnaissance
of the terrain must be carefully made by artillery officers
in small groups . If possible, positions for the batteries
should be so placed that the artillery mission may be
.carried out without change of locations . Ammunition
supply, observation, hostile position, communications,
alternate positions, and range must all be considered,
and any necessary preparations carried out in advance.
The distribution of the artillery will be determined by
its mission . Units Will usually be employed intact ; it
may, however, be necessary to detach batteries, particularly
the heavy artillery. In very narrow division sectors,
for example, heavy howitzer batteries may be taken away
from divisions to operate against distant targets under
corps.
TILL ATTA K J1
The initial mission of the artillery may include any
or all of the following : firing upon important targets in
the battlefield, drawing the fire of hostile artillery, engaging
in counterbattery work against hostile artillery and antiaircraft
batteries as early as possible, and firing upon
large hostile group movements at maximum ranges and
as promptly as possible .
52. INFANTRY POSITION OF READINESS (BEREIT.
STELLUNG)
The following considerations for an infantry ""position of
readiness"" may be listed as follows :
(a) Avoid too close proximity to the enemy position in
cases where no cover is available to friendly troops . (b) If
the enemy has previously offered strong resistance in the
fighting, if there is reason to avoid premature entrance
into the effective hostile defensive area, or if the enemy
situation in the main battle position is not clarified, have
the troops partially developed before they are conducted
forward in their respective zones of action . (c) Avoid
hostile air and ground obstruction by prohibiting large
assemblies in restricted areas, by exploiting all ground folds
and available cover, and by approaching inunediately
prior to the jump-off as close to the hostile position
cover permits . (d) Select the infantry jump-off position
as close as possible to the hostile position in order to permit
the artillery to push well forward and carry out its mission
without changing location .12 (e) Establish local security
1% When the terrain and available cover do not permit the close approach of
the infantry, the artillery must be echeloned to the rear and prepared to
support the infantry advance on the enemy position .
52 GERMAN TA TI AL TDRIONE
with infantry detachments . (f) Gain sufficient depth by
drawing out and retaining reserves to the rear . (g) If the
forces going into the position of readiness are scheduled
to make a close-in envelopment, insure that the position
is a sufficient distance off to the side to preclude the
enveloping force advancing into and mixing with other
friendly troops on the flank, when the attack is launched .
53 . INFANTRY A TION UP TO THE FIRST ASSAULT
The infantry action up to the first assault is carried out
under the support of artillery and heavy infantry weapons .
If exceptionally strong artillery support is available, the
infantry can more freely advance against the enemy
position ; if the artillery support is not strong, however,
then the infantry must advance cautiously . In the latter
case, moving forward under cover of darkness or of smoke,
the infantry takes advantage of cover to avoid hostile
observation and of defiladed ground to avoid hostile fire .
The infantry attack begins with the advance of the
light weapons under cover of the fire of artillery and
heavy infantry weapons . Part of the latter should be
pushed forward with the initial echelons to insure continual
close support . Riflemen work forward through
the use of fire and movement . Local fire superiority
must be exploited to the fullest degree to capture ground .
Those units or parts of units which cannot advance
farther should dig in and hold tenaciously the ground
already won . When weak points in the hostile position
are found, they should be attacked aggressively and with
reserves. Thus a push forward can be made . Against
consolidated and extensive defensive works on the other
hand, the infantry may struggle for days, working slowly
'1'11E ATTA K 53
forward . Trenches and terrain may be won, lost ., anfl
rewon during the course of the action .
54. ARTILLERY SUPPORT OF THE INFANTRY ADVAN
E
The effectiveness of counterbattery missions directed
by the artillery commander depends upon observation
and available ammunition . Neutralization was often accomplished
in World War I by a simultaneous concentration
of several batteries using gas shells . Initially,
rmany batteries may be concealed in a firing position
awaiting the opportunity to surprise the enemy . When
new hostile batteries are discovered or additional enemy
forces 13 are located, then concentrated fire may be delivered
upon them with these batteries . This method is
much more economical in ammunition than continual fire
of all artillery against apparent but not definitely identified
targets .
As the situation develops and clarifies, artillery fire eon
be switched from the manifestly less important targets to
the more important areas . The infantry will sometimes
be unavoidably delayed in its advance by reason of changes
in the infantry-artillery plan of coordination . There will
be situations in which many hostile batteries will not be
located until friendly infantry has pushed forward and
drawn fire .
55 . INTERMITTENT ADVAN E OF THE RESERVES
At the disposal of the commander, the reserves follow
beyond range of hostile fire . When the terrain permits,
~' Artillery engages the hostile infantry which is fighting on the flank or
in front of friendly infantry,
04 GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
their advance should be made by bounds from cover
to cover.
56. BREAK-THROUGH
a. Penetration of the Hostile Position
The timing of the assault is determined either by the
forward echelons-or by the commander himself . No hard
and fast rule can be applied . Should the foremost units
recognize the opportunity to push through, they must take
full and quick advantage, calling upon supporting
weapons for intensified fire to support their assault .
When the infantry is observed advancing rapidly on the
hostile position, this increased support may under certain
circumstances occur automatically . Should the commander
order the assault-avoiding an elaborate planhe
must quickly concentrate his strength at the point
of penetration .
b. Time of Attack
Daybreak is often considered the most favorable time
to gain surprise for the attack . War experience indicates,
however, that daybreak is the time of highest alertness,
and it is better to change continually the hour of attack .
The time of attack should usually be postponed if the
artillery has not completed all of its preparations . An
attack against a position must be supported by artillery
which is fully prepared to carry out its missions . In
order to penetrate a stubbornly defended main line of
resistance, concentrations of fire by all weapons must be
arranged.
. Enemy Withdrawals
If the enemy withdraws to rearward positions (a move
generally accomplished at night), the following action
TILL ATTA K JO
should be taken : (a) Maintain close contact with the
hostile infantry . (b) Promptly reconnoiter the new hostile
positions . (c) Move the artillery well forward, (d) Prepare
for hostile counterattacks . (e) On the following day,
push rapidly forward with all force ; compel the enemy
to stand and fight, to take flight, or to suffer destruction .
57. A TION RE OMMENDED FOR ERTAIN SPE IAL
ASES
If the enemy has had only a short time in which to
prepare his defensive position, if the morale of the enemy
is shaken, or if the possibility of surprise is introduced,
the preparations for attacking a position may be shortened
to limited reconnaissance, more rapid development and
preparation by the artillery, and employment of tanks
and smoke screens.
If the enemy resorts to delaying action, the response
should be to break through his line at one point and
exploit the break with strong force, and to press closely
upon the withdrawing hostile troops .
If the enemy falls behind the cover of a very strong
position, the direction or location of the main effort should
be changed . Knowledge of the terrain will permit advance
planning in this maneuver . More artillery, tanks, and
engineer troops should be moved well forward, and minimum
requirements should be established in the communication
system . If the enemy succeeds in falling back
upon an entirely new and very strong defensive position,
a regrouping of the attacking forces and new plans may
be required.
56 GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
If the attack continues until nightfall without producing
decisive results, the regrouping of the command
should be carried on under cover of darkness . The day's
battle experience may indicate a new point for the main
effort, and the order for attack should be issued just as
early as possible . Reconnaissance must be energetic and
continued, for the-enemy will also make changes in his
disposition during darkness. Night attacks are useful
in determining hostile intentions and movements, in
seizing favorable positions for the following day's jumpoff,
and in obtaining observation . Harassing fire by the
artillery and air night-bombing attacks should be scheduled
. Artillery support may not be possible at dawn of
the following day, unless the exact enemy positions have
been located. Only then can the artillery deliver unobserved
supporting fires . Sufficient light for artillery
observations should be awaited in preference to sending
the infantry forward unsupported . Artillery on other
fronts may be fired for deceptive purposes during the
interval of waiting .
Passing over to the defense from the attack may be a
necessary prelude to holding captured ground, or may be
ordered by higher authority. Troops in either case are
reorganized, and unnecessary forces withdrawn . Artillery
must protect the relief of friendly infantry by heavy
concentrations and counterbattery fire .
58 . MEETING ENGAGEMENT
a . Speed and Surprise
In a meeting engagement, it is possible (though improbable
with modern far-reaching reconnaissance and
intelligence means) that the first information of the
THE AITA K Or
presence of the enemy will he received through actual
contact . Initially the situation is vague and the security
of both forces uncertain . A meeting engagement must
not be permitted to develop into a wild rush upon the
hostile per,ition ; a coordinated plan must be carried out,
calmly, but so accelerated as to carry out the following
considerations : (a) Seize the initiative and fix the hostile
force insofar as the situation permits . (b) Expedite
preparations for the attack, quickly occupying ground
favorable for observation, development, and advance, and
for supporting weapons. (c) Intensify reconnaissance,
ground and air, to determine promptly the enemy's
dispositions, strength, intentions, and weaknesses . (d)
Surprise the enemy, principally by rapidity of movement
and by screening your troops and movements prior to
entrance into battle .
6 . Time and Space
The advance guard of each march column must provide
time and space for development by the main body. An
energetic advance under cover of the advance guard
artillery often seizes important terrain features to the
front and flanks, ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ft indicates attack or not. This
combined with heavy bombing attacks will drive the enemy to cover
on approach of large aircraft formations and will help to cover
an eventual airborne landing.
(d) When it is considered that the morale of the garrison
has sufficiently deteriorated, water-borne patrols may be sent to
determine the situation.
(e) If found to be ripe, airborne, followed by waterborne,
troops should be landed immediately following a bomber raid
(when defenders have been driven to ground) and mop up and take
the surrender.
7. It is my opinion that the Plans Section appreciation is based upon too
many hypothetical considerations which may differ very considerably
from actualities  and, in fact, according to latest intelligence, already do
in respect to saturated areas on SUID BEVELAND. In view of the
forthcoming conference on the 23rd September, 1944, I would like to put
forward the following for consideration as the basis for future planning.
(a) 2 Cdn Inf Div to push Northward to cut off SUID
BEVELAND and exploit the land approach along SUID BEVELAND
as far as practicable.
(b) 4 Cdn Armd Div to continue its operations to clear
the area NORTH of the LEOPOLD CANAL up to the WEST
SCHELDT until 3 Cdn Inf Div is available to relieve it. This is a
highly unsuitable task for an armoured division but I have nothing
else available within the present constitution and tasks of 2nd Cdn
Corps.
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
124
Acting Army Commander
(c) As soon as 3 Cdn Inf Div can be released from
BOULOGNE-CALAIS area, this division less one infantry brigade
will relieve 4 Cdn Armd Div and complete the clearing of the area
NORTH of LEOPOLD CANAL if this has not been completed by
that time.
(d) One infantry brigade of 3 Cdn Inf Div to be
earmarked with necessary Naval counterpart to train at OSTEND
for seaborne operations against WALCHEREN.
(e) Airborne forces earmarked for this operation, to
study and train for landings on those parts of WALCHEREN
ISLAND which cannot be sunk by flooding.
(f) Bombing 
(i) To break dykes and flood WALCHEREN
ISLAND.
(ii) Destroy defences and break morale of
defenders of unsinkable portions of the island, be instituted
forthwith.

Operation INFATUATE
1. I return herewith the official report of the ANCXF on Operation
INFATUATE.
2. In commenting upon the report, I wish to state at the outset that I
consider the decision made by the joint commanders of the assaulting
forces at WESTKAPELLE was a courageous and correct one. Based
upon the assumption that air support would be possible at H hour, my
original instructions to the force commanders were that, once the
expedition had been ordered to sail, they would assault unless sea
conditions made the lowering of craft impracticable. On the evening of
D-1 the forecast indicated that the weather, though satisfactory from
the naval standpoint, was unlikely to be suitable for air support at the
time fixed for the landing. I therefore, in agreement with ANCXF, sent an
instruction to the force commanders informing them that air support
might not be possible and leaving the final decision to assault to be made
by them in light of conditions on the spot. As soon as the early morning
forecast came to my hands, I sent a further message stating that air
support at the predetermined H hour was most unlikely. Throughout
planning and development of the operation I had personally impressed
upon all commanders the vital importance of pressing to a conclusion the
operations for clearing the SCHELDT, that risks must be accepted to
achieve early success, and the all-around advantages which would accrue
from simultaneous assaults at the BEVELAND causeway at FLUSHING,
and at WESTKAPELLE. I consider that their decision was right and that
the losses involved were justifiable because of the importance of the
operations. If the losses be considered unduly heavy, the responsibility is
mine in view of the orders which I issued to the joint commanders, but I
consider the credit for what I believe was a courageous and right
decision, and for the determination with which the assault was carried
through to a most successful conclusion, belongs to them.
3. It is on paragraphs 3 and 4 that I particularly wish to comment.
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
126
Acting Army Commander
4. Paragraph 3 of ANCXF Report:
The complications in planning arose from the fact that
INFATUATE was a subsidiary part of a much larger Army
operation with which it had to be timed and co-ordinated. The
number of army commanders with whom Commander Force T
had to deal arose directly from the fact that in operational matters
he worked back through naval channels of command which were
not represented by an officer empowered to make decisions at the
corresponding army headquarters. In my opinion, in such
circumstances, the naval force required should have been placed
directly under the command of the army with the right of access
to higher naval authorities in technical naval matters. When, as
in the case of INFATUATE, a combined operation is to be
undertaken as a subsidiary part of other large scale operations on
land, when its mounting and launching will be dependent upon,
and must be synchronized with, the development of those
operations, then once the operation has been decided upon at the
higher level, the combined forces detailed for its execution should
come under command of the military commander responsible for
the operations as a whole. The following points must be decided
at the highest level:-
(a) That the operation is desirable, taking all factors into
consideration.
(b) That it is practicable.
(c) That adequate naval forces are available.
(d) Naval limitations regarding its mounting and launching.
(e) Nomination of the naval forces and their commander and
agreement in outline for combined training and planning.
Once the above points have been settled, the naval commander
working with the military force commander should take his
directions solely from the army commander responsible for the
whole operation.
It is true that training the naval force in England increased the
difficulties of detailed planning at the lower levels since army and
naval commanders were not able to work together from the
outset. This was a condition imposed by naval considerations
127
affecting the use of OSTENDE as a training port and one only
accepted by the army on naval representation that training from
a continental base was impracticable.
5. Paragraph 4 of ANCXF Report:
Though no joint plan was submitted in writing to the Supreme
Allied Command, I do not accept the statement that No proper
joint plan was ever produced. A joint naval and army plan,
based upon the tasks and outline which had been given to them,
was produced by the force commanders responsible for the
execution of the operation. In my opinion this is a correct
procedure.
From the outset it, it was made clear to the two force commanders
that the plan must be flexible. Its final form depended upon the
success of the attempt to breach the dykes, the extent of flooding
and enemy reactions to the attacks in the Breskens bridgehead
and South Beveland. It is my opinion that a tendency has grown
up to make combined planning too rigid and inflexible. As a
result of early failures because of no proper combined plan we
now veer to the other extreme and attempt to legislate in detail for
events which will depend upon the sway of battle. Three other
amphibious assaults were mounted during the Scheldt operation
(crossing the Savojaards Plaat, the assault on South Beveland
and the assault on Flushing). All three were mounted at short
notice and all three were most successful because they were timed
with the run of the battle. Had the full dress procedure been
adopted they could never have been mounted in time to take
advantage of favourable situations.
In regard to the question of air support, though the army acted as
the co-ordinators for the pre-D Day programme, this
programme was merely a collated list of targets required to be
engaged by the navy, the army and the RAF. The programme was
compiled as a result of submissions of all three Services at joint
conferences. It was modified as a result of the success of the dyke
cutting and flooding operations (this principally affected the flak
targets which the RAF had submitted for engagement). The
Commander, Naval Force T, was kept fully informed of the
programme and any amendments made to it and of the
engagement of targets by Bomber Command. There was a RAF
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
128
Acting Army Commander
representative at the joint force headquarters available to
represent any specific requirements of Force T in respect to
target engagements. I would point out that in principle, this
procedure was exactly the same as that followed in the case of the
air support for the landing of 1st Cdn Inf Div in Sicily. Admiral
Vian and myself, through the attached air adviser, submitted our
requirements, but the allocation of air effort was determined at
the highest level, and what we wished had to be balanced against
the air forces available and what were considered to be the most
vital targets.
6. The difficulties of the assaulting forces at WESTKAPELLE arose from
the fact that the pre-D Day air effort against certain targets failed to
produce the desired effect, and the assault went in without air support or
spotting aircraft to control the fire of bombarding ships. The
disappointing results of the pre-D Day bombing attacks were NOT the
result of faulty joint planning. Before the operation there was never any
suggestion that the pre-D Day target programme as co-ordinated at
HQ First Cdn Army would not meet naval requirements. It is only the
effect which seems to be in question. The RAF representatives have
insisted throughout all discussions on questions of air support that they
alone are the judges of the number and type of aircraft and the weight and
type of bomb required to produce a given effect on a specified target. I
have not agreed and do not now agree that the RAF should be the sole
judges in this matter. Very often the troops who subsequently assault an
objective are in a far better position to judge the effect of a prior air
bombardment than are the RAF who deliver the bombs. Though accurate
assessment of physical damage can usually be made from air
photography, by far the most important effect, i.e., weakening of the
morale of the enemy, is better assessed by the troops who have to deal
with them.
7. It is not possible at an Army level to judge what were the conflicting
demands for the available strategic bombing effort at the time of the
WALCHEREN operations, nor the over-all priorities. I assume that the
general air situation was such that the effort against the WALCHEREN
batteries represented a maximum, taking all vital commitments into
consideration. When I agreed to a short intensive softening instead of
a prolonged systematic bombardment of the batteries, I was assured by
the C of S, 21 Army Group, that the tasks would be first priority targets
for Bomber Command.
129
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
130
8. It is obvious that the bombing effort placed on the various batteries
covering the approaches of WESTKAPELLE failed to achieve the
expected and desired result. I question the argument that at best the air
can only neutralize and cannot destroy and therefore no better result
would have been obtained by a greater force prior to D Day. The
principle batteries concerned were in open casemates and a study of the
bombing pattern and accuracy of the MPI on targets where the dykes
were cut clearly indicate that had a similar effort been placed on each
battery, extensive if not complete destruction would have resulted. The
damage done has a direct effect on enemy morale as detachments will be
less inclined to leave their bunkers and man equipments in a position that
has suffered heavy damage.
9. It was unfortunate that the weather on the morning of 1 November,
1944, did not permit the employment of spotting or tactical support
aircraft at the time of the assault. The forecast indicated this would be
the condition and the risks were quite clear to me when, in agreement
with Admiral Ramsey, we ordered the operation to proceed. The fact is
that when, during planning, weather probabilities were examined, there
were some six days in the year on which the weather conditions would
meet the requirements of all three services as originally stated, and these
might occur in May and June. The operations to clear the SCHELDT had
to be carried out in the season of October  November and it was clear to
me from the outset that I would have to be prepared to accept conditions
very much less than the ideal. Had I not proceeded with the operation
because of the adverse conditions from the point of view of the air, in the
following days the conditions would have been impossible from the naval
point of view. In fact, I consider that Providence was more than good to
us in the weather which we were given on D Day, in that it was good
from the naval stand point and, at the most critical stage, it cleared
sufficiently to fly tactical support aircraft.
10. It would be my wish that the operations could have succeeded with
much lighter naval casualties, but to keep things in their right perspective,
I must point out that these were a mere fraction of the casualties suffered
by the army formations involved in the operations for clearing the
SCHELDT Estuary and that the 2nd Cdn Inf Div suffered heavier
casualties in their initial assault across the BEVELAND causeway than
either of the assaulting forces at FLUSHING and WESTKAPELLE.
11. It was impressed upon me by the C-in-C, 21 Army Group, that the
early clearance of the SCHELDT Estuary and opening of the Port of
Acting Army Commander
131
ANTWERP was of such vital importance that risks must be accepted to
effect quick results. It is true that the casualties to the WESTKAPELLE
assaulting force might have been less had the bomber effort on the coast
defence batteries on WALCHEREN been greater, but this must be
balanced against the over-all priorities and employment of the strategic
air forces at that time. The allied war effort as a whole may have been
better served by the employment elsewhere of the additional heavy
bomber effort which would have made the difference. As I have already
explained, I was not then, and I am not now, in a position to make such an
assessment. That the bombing attacks failed to produce the desired effect
against the batteries at WALCHEREN must be evident to the RAF and to
Bomber Command. In the interests of inter-Service relations, I do not
think any useful purpose would be served by the army making critical
representations at this time. We can learn our lesson without that, and I
think that in the future the RAF must be more ready to accept the armys
views as to the weight of effort required on various targets. We now have
a much accumulated experience on which to base assessment of probable
results.

CHAPTER 5
Battle Exhaustion and Morale
By the summer of 1944 the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps had
developed a systematic approach to the problem of battle exhaustion, the
term used in the British and Canadian armies for stress-related psychiatric
casualties. The Canadian psychiatrists initially tried to work within the standing
orders issued by 21 Army Group, which emphasized the role of the Regimental
Medical Officer, but experience in Italy led to the appointment of a divisional
psychiatrist for 3rd Division, an innovation accepted by the staff of I British
Corps. No such appointment was made for either 2nd or 4th Canadian divisions,
as Corps headquarters insisted on a standard British model with psychiatrists
located at a Corps Exhaustion Unit. No psychiatry was permitted during the
training phase. It is not possible to determine whether Simonds played any role in
determining this policy, which was implemented by the senior medical officer at
Corps Headquarters.
Dr. Robert Gregory1 took up his position with 3rd Division in March 1944
and immediately began a program of talks to regimental medical officers (RMOs),
outlining a procedure wherein all but the mildest exhaustion cases would be sent
to a specially designated Field Ambulance. Only the divisional psychiatrist would
be authorized to evacuate men beyond that level. Gregory wanted medical
officers in each Field Ambulance to be trained in the ordinary mechanical end of
treatment and urged that courses for two officers from each Field Ambulance be
arranged with the American Army hospital of Psychiatry at the earliest possible
time.2 The Divisions senior medical officer, ADMS Colonel M.C. Watson,
endorsed Gregorys work, and in April space was found for the Canadian doctors
at the American school. Gregory attended the sessions and reported: The course
includes the outline of treatment of combat exhaustion in its different forms and
actual demonstrations of how the cases should be handled. It was suggested that,
insofar as possible, the exhaustion cases should be kept separate from the
wounded principally for reasons of morale. The three MOs, one from each Field
Ambulance in the division, were extremely pleased and interested. They will be
expected to act as aids to the Divisional Psychiatrist should conditions be such that
treatment may be established at the Field Ambulance level. If treatment of the
cases is further back they will be expected to check all exhaustion cases for proper
sedation so that in evacuation they will be quiet and not upset the morale of the
others.3
Gregory also noted that copies of the American guidelines on exhaustion
had been obtained and would be used in the talks that the RMOs were to give to
the officers and NCOs of their units. These are men who will be in direct contact
with the soldiers in the fighting and will be the ones who have the best chance of
observing early symptoms. If the predromal symptoms can be recognized by
these it may be possible to get the exhaustion cases early enough to treat them
within unit lines and avoid having them crack.4
Preparations for forward treatment of battle exhaustion occurred in
conjunction with a screening of the division. Gregory had read psychiatric reports
from the Mediterranean and was quite willing to assist units in getting rid of
neurotics and inadequates who were apt to give trouble in action,5 but during
a three-month period in which all units were carefully weeded only 127 men
were removed on psychiatric grounds. Gregory was more concerned about the
reinforcement units that would supply the division where there is much to be
desired in the training of replacements and the keeping up of their morale.6 The
3rd Division as a whole, Gregory reported, was in fine shape. The general
morale throughout the division is excellent. The troops are relaxed and in the
highest spirits. Some of the officers and practically all other ranks feel that our
troops will go twenty-five miles in one day, that they have the fire power, the naval
support and air superiority. There seems to be no talk of hazard.7
Experience in other campaigns had suggested that battle exhaustion
would be quite low in the initial days of fighting.8 Psychiatrists had been forced
to note this fact, but they had great difficulty in explaining it. The most common
assumption about battle exhaustion  predisposition  provided little insight into
this situation. Some psychiatrists suggested that soldiers with a poor history were
able to keep their anxiety under control for a short time through an effort of will.
A rise in exhaustion casualties, they assumed, would begin after such individuals
had been exposed to a longer period of stress.9
The initial bridgehead battles were over by 11 June. The British-Canadian
forces spend the next two weeks holding the perimeter under continuous shelling
and mortaring. Offensive operations were confined to relatively minor probing

attacks designed to hold the Germans on the eastern flank. Battle exhaustion
casualties remained well below the percentages reported in Italy. On the American
front, where the priority was assigned to the capture of Cherbourg, requiring
continuous attacks, exhaustion ratios were similarly about half the number
indicated by the experience of heavy fighting in Italy.10 Differences in diagnosis
and reporting made all these psychiatric numbers doubtful, but everyone in the
bridgehead agreed with Major D.J. Watterson, the 2nd British Armys psychiatrist,
when on 24 June he described the ratio of exhaustion as lower than expected,
probably 10 percent or a little more.11 (In Northwest Europe the terms NP ratio
or exhaustion ratio expressed the relationship between psychiatric casualties and
all non-fatal casualties, including psychiatric ones). Watterson reported that the
initial psychiatric casualties included large numbers of men who were unfit for
front line duty and who had been weeded out by a process of natural selection.
This fact, as well as the high rate of breakdown among unit residues12 (those
brought over from other units as immediate reinforcements), would, he believed,
begin to diminish in importance leaving only the true battle exhaustion cases for
psychiatrists to deal with.
True battle exhaustion cases, according to Watterson, were those men of
normal personality who broke down when their personal morale failed. This, he
maintained, was usually the result of a collapse in unit morale. He noted that the
importance of good leadership in limiting psychiatric casualties had been brought
out clearly again and again during the June battles. The cause of a rise in the NP
rate, he wrote, could only be understood in the context of the battalion: Is the unit
well led? Are its welfare needs attended to? Is the post coming up to scratch? Do
the men know the latest German weapons? Does the unit need resting?13 These
and other similar questions had to be answered if battle exhaustion was to be
understood.
Canadian medical officers agreed with Watterson. Gregory was confident
that everything was under control. He reported that the low incidence of
exhaustion in the 3rd Canadian Division was evidence of the successful
weeding of the division, while the 200-odd breakdowns were proof that a
division cannot be completely weeded. He added that the numbers and
percentage of NP casualties bares no relation to the daily total casualties but bears
the usual relation to the conditions of the troops (fatigue etc.), the tactical situation
and the stiffness of resistance, e.g. the greatest number of NP casualties occurred
when the troops were very tired, very static, dug-in and under heavy
counterattack. Fully 80 per cent of the NP casualties complained bitterly of mortar
fire and 88 mm artillery.14
On 24 June General Montgomery launched the first of a series of major
Battle Exhaustion and Morale
135
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
136
offensive operations designed to capture the City of Caen and break out into the
open country to the south. By mid-July the small infantry component of 21 Army
Group, less than 15 per cent of the total manpower in the bridgehead, had suffered
enormous casualties. On average one in every four of these casualties was due to
battle exhaustion.15 On the western flank, the United States Army, pressing
towards St. Lô, in the difficult boccage country, was experiencing even heavier
total casualties with a similar NP rate.16 In retrospect it is possible to argue that
the battles of late June and July wore down the German defenders and precipitated
a major collapse of enemy morale, but this was not apparent to anyone at the time.
During July the Allied armies were too concerned about their own crisis to wonder
about the enemys problems.
The Canadians were especially concerned with the immediate impact of
battle exhaustion on 2nd Division. The division had entered the line on 11 July.
Under continuous mortaring it had immediately begun to suffer relatively large
numbers of exhaustion cases, which in the absence of any divisional centre were
evacuated to the Corps Exhaustion Unit. The CEU War Diary for the period
includes the following entries:
13 July 1944: The first twelve patients arrived at 1200 hours. The
majority of these were from RRC (Royal Regiment of Canada)
which had been in action two days Histories were taken, each
man was given three grains of Sodium Amytal and put to bed.
14 July 1944: Forty-one patients were admitted today. About
15 of these are cases which have been out of the line for about a
week cases seen yesterday and today have shown chiefly
anxiety symptoms the precipitation factor in most cases is said
to be blast  mortar more frequently than shell.
15 July 1944: Twenty-six patients were admitted today and with
a top accommodation of 110 beds, it is apparent that our plan of
two days sedation and three days rehabilitation will not be
practicable As we are now discharging patients,
psychotherapeutic talks to groups about to be discharged have
now been instituted. These consist of simple explanations of
psychogenic symptoms exhaustion versus shell shock etc
Many of the men understand the mechanism of their trouble
alright, and most are ready to admit that the origin is emotional
rather than physical but many are without any incentive to carry
on further.
Battle Exhaustion and Morale
137
16 July 1944: Twenty-three patients have been admitted today
and our bed strength is now eighty-four.
17 July 1944: Hope of adequate and rehabilitation will have to
be abandoned The treatment cases are without pyjamas and the
convalescents have to wear their dirty and tattered clothes.
18 July 1944: We were awakened this morning by a terrific roar
of gunfire rumour is that This is it and that the show should
soon be over. So far our admissions have not exceeded the usual
level: about twenty-two today We face a serious shortage of
sedative.17
One hundred and sixty patients, the large majority from the 2nd Division,
had been evacuated to the Canadian Exhaustion Unit (CEU) in a six-day period
preceding the divisions first major battle. These numbers seriously taxed its
resources. This was not a very good beginning and did not fit with preconceptions
about how and when exhaustion cases would occur.
There is no record of Simonds involvement in debates about battle
exhaustion in Italy, which did not begin to become a problem until after his
departure. Crerar, who had overall responsibility for the medical services and
contact with the Advisor-in-Psychiatry, Colonel F.H. Van Nostrand, provided
Simonds with some policy guidance in a letter dated 15 July 1944 and on 30 July
Simonds issued a directive To All Formation Commanders, 2nd Canadian Corps
which spelled out his ideas on command responsibility when opportunities
occurred to withdraw units for short periods of rest. (Both documents are
reproduced below).
Simonds did not address the specific problem of battle exhaustion, a
medical diagnosis, until 29 August when he was deeply concerned by the
deficiencies in unit establishment which were not the result of battle casualties.
(The document is reproduced below.) After August 1944 both Crerar and Simonds
left the problem of psychiatric casualties to the responsible medical officers. They
seemed to have accepted the inevitability of a significant number of such
casualties and were now confident that Canadian army psychiatrists were dealing
with the problem effectively. Simonds focused his attention on the problems
encountered in integrating reinforcements into combat units and issued detailed
instructions on this matter in late October 1944. (This document is reproduced at
the end of this chapter.)

"elon it may be used to develop the enemy situation with a
secondary attack supported by artillery combat aviation
engineers and when necessary by some of the tanks
â¢ 20 The attack of the armored division requires careful
coordination of the supporting fires of the artillery heavy
infantry weapons including mortars and combat aviation
to prevent concentration of hostile mobile antitank weapons
in the zone chosen for the offensive and to neutralize enemy
weapons dangerous to the attack
At times preparatory fires may be omitted in order to
attain surprise
â¢ 2 The artillery covers the development of the division
It may be employed to neutralize hostile rear defenses until
the engagement of the tanks or to concentrate on areas secure
from tank attack In support of the division attack
the artillery fires are directed to the neutralization of the
antitank defense and artillery which constitute the greatest
threat to the advance Frequently small artillery units are
pushed forward prior to the attack in order to deliver direct
fire on targets of opportunity Prearranged signals and
messages are used to facilitate cooperation between the tanks
and supporting weapons
'
22 In a meeting engagement with unarmored troops the
attack is pushed to conclusion without delay The attack is
launched promptly and aggressively in order to afford the
enemy no time to develop and concentrate his defensive
means Tank attacks on a broad front against a flank will

OPERATIONS
22- 26
engage a greater number of enemy troops simultaneously and
permit a maximum use of shock and fire power If flank
attacks are not practicable frontal attacks with deployment
on a narrow front in great depth are made from march
columns
23 In a meeting engagement with hostile armored units
the advance guard supported by artillery and combat aviation
attacks to limit hostile maneuver to the front and to deceive
the enemy regarding the direction time and strength of the
main blow The situation may favor the main blow as a
follow through of the advance guard action Otherwise the
division seeks to launch its striking force against the flanks
and rear of the hostile force to surround and destroy it
Supporting combat aviation attacks hostile tanks artillery
antitank weapons reserves and reinforcing troops
24 In an enveloping attack by the division acting alone
against an enemy in position the support echelon may attack
to fix the enemy front while the striking echelon makes the
main attack In cooperation with other large unarmored
units the entire armored division is employed to make or
lead the enveloping attack while other units hold the enemy
in position
When the direction of the envelopment has been determined
the striking echelon preceded by its reconnaissance
units and covering detachments develops and maneuvers
rapidly to launch its attack Elements of the support echelon
not required for the secondary attack follow the striking
echelon closely
25 The armored division penetrates an enemy position
on a narrow front and then extends to attack the enemy rear
in order to destroy his defense and exploit the success
26 In penetrations of organized positions in cooperation
with other large units of the combined arms the zone of the
initial break-through may be neutralized or breached by
other troops The armored division is then employed to continue
the attack and complete and exploit the hostile disruption
It is followed immediately by other highly mobile
units to extend widen or hold the breach Motorized divisions
are especially suitable for this purpose
974
27- 3
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
4 27 Delay in launching the armored division through a
neutralized zone or a breach affords the enemy time in which
to organize and coordinate countermeasures and may result
in a serious reverse
The shoulders of the gap must be held securely either by
troops of the support echelon or by other troops The passage
of the armored division through the breach must be
effectively protected against antitank gun fire and hostile air
and ground reaction Once the breach has been effected the
enemy must not be permitted to close it Flank attacks continue
to widen the breach
Hostile counterattacks against the flanks of the penetration
are met by combat aviation by reserves and by the fire of
artillery antiaircraft artillery and antitank weapons
28 When forward progress of attacking units is stopped
by hostile resistance fire of artillery and combat aviation is
concentrated on the resistance and flanking movements are
initiated at once
Elements of the support echelon reinforced by combat
aviation artillery and engineers may be employed to advance
the attack beyond terrain obstacles or ground unfavorable
for tank action
29 Some reorganization of assault units is often necessary
after each tank objective is overrun The leading waves
may be passed through by other tank units Every effort
must be made to maintain the continuity and speed of the
attack
30 If the tank attack is unsuccessful initially the advance
elements of the support echelon strong in machine
guns and antitank guns immediately establish a position
behind which the tanks withdraw and reorganize for further
effort The supporting artillery and combat aviation protect
the reorganization
â 3 When the armored division has passed through the
hostile organized resistance its ground reconnaissance elements
are dispatched at once toward the objective These
elements working in close cooperation with the air reconnaissance
report hostile reserves and artillery hostile command
and supply installations and unfavorable terrain
Appropriate targets are attacked
i
OPERATIONS
32- 36
8 32 The division must provide flank protection Flank
protection is aided by the speed of the advance the utilization
of natural barriers on the flank and by the support of
combat aviation
8 33 When the striking echelon captures its objective
the necessary reorganization is initiated at once under the
protection of the support echelon artillery and combat
aviation
Reorganization and consolidation of the objective are limited
to the essentials An advance to a second objective or
exploitation of the success is begun without delay Exploitation
often will be executed in close cooperation with other
highly mobile troops which have been moved close behind
the armored division in its attack
Extended exploitation may be initiated immediately after
passage of the hostile organized resistance without waiting
for reorganization or consolidation of the objective This is
particularly true in attacks against inferior hostile troops
and against troops weak in aviation and mechanized units
34 The armored division may be employed to exploit its
own success and the successes of other troops by rapid attacks
from the rear to overrun the hostile artillery to destroy reserves
and command and supply establishments to break up
hostile counterattacks and to block strong reserves moving to
restore the battle position or to occupy rear positions
n 35 In exploiting a break-through the armored division is
effectively employed to operate at great distances in the
hostile rear areas to block routes of hostile movement to
attack strategic reserves and to seize vital areas In such
operations the division normally constitutes a part of a
larger armored force which is closely followed by other mobile
units such as motorized divisions Since the purpose of these
operations is the complete destruction of the enemy by placing
a powerful striking force in his rear the division moves
through the area of the break-through at the greatest possible
speed Troops transported by air may be suitably employed
in advance of the armored divisions Opportunities for
decisive exploitation by armored forces must be created
36 Before directing exploitation or pursuit the commander
of the armored division must assure the required
36- 4
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
supply of ammunition and motor fuel in combat elements
His plan must include provision for both supply and motor
maintenance during the subsequent operations Normally
little dependence should be placed on procuring motor fuel
locally
It 37 Once undertaken pursuit must be boldly pushed
with the utmost vigor and ruthlessness Acting alone the
division organizes all combat elements for pursuit by direct
pressure and by encirclement A strong encircling force is
provided The tank units with the direct pressure force seek
to pass through gaps which the attack may have opened in
the hostile dispositions or to gain the rear of the enemy's
covering force in order to attack the withdrawing hostile
elements The encircling force moves to strike the heads
of the retreating columns by placing itself across the line of
retreat on terrain favorable for its operation
i 38 In a pursuit when operating with large forces the
armored division reinforced with highly mobile units is normally
employed as an encircling force
â¢ 39 In all pursuit operations combat aviation acting in
conjunction with the pursuing armored units materially assists
in obtaining decisive results
DEFENSIVE OPERATIONS
â¢ 40 The employment of the armored division on a defensive
position seriously restricts the use of its mobility and
should be resorted to only in emergency
A 4 Opposed to greatly superior armored forces the division
avoids decisive combat if its mission permits such action
If its mission requires it to gain time it either occupies
terrain unfavorable for hostile tank attacks or employs
delaying tactics When a position must be defended by the
division against superior hostile armored troops every advantage
is taken of obstacles to protect the position and
restrict the direction of the hostile attack
The position selected should afford room for maneuver
suitable terrain for counterattacks and concealed routes of
withdrawal The units of the support echelon organize defense
areas disposed in depth so as to take full advantage of
276
OPERATIONS
4 - 44
obstacles The tank units prepare plans for counterattacks
and for ambush against hostile tank units
â 42 When the terrain is favorable the armored division
either alone or in cooperation with other forces may be employed
in counterattack The characteristics of the armored
division may justify assigning it objectives considerably
deeper or further to a flank than those whose capture would
be necessary merely to restore the defensive position
43 When a large force reinforced by armored divisions
passes from the defensive to the offensive the armored divisions
may be employed rapidly to envelop a hostile flank or
to form the spearhead of a penetration of a weak portion
of the hostile front
0 44 In delaying action against less mobile forces the
support echelon operates against the heads of the advancing
enemy units while the tanks threaten or attack the hostile
flanks and rear Against hostile armored troops every effort
is made to locate each delaying position behind a formidable
natural obstacle Tank units protect the flanks and execute
local counterattacks
277

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
When tanks are employed in an attack intensive reconnaissance
to discover antimechanized defenses must be
initiated promptly and must be continued throughout the
tank action
When necessary engineer troops with suitable equipment
are attached to tank units to assist their advance Mine fields
and serious obstacles must be destroyed before the tank
attack is launched Their destruction must be accomplished
at the last possible moment in order not to warn the enemy
of the impending attack

and taught before troops arrive 'in the battle!

b. The technique of laying minefields needs -
improvement, especially in night operations .
Coordination must be' obtained between the
organization selecting the sites and those re- .
sponsible for guarding and protecting them .

dug slit' trenches have given adequate protection
against the worst bombing . In artillery
positions, the. slit trenches . should be contiguous
to the gun pits .
f, Placing of all organic weapons suitable
for, antiaircraft, firing, and the .. attached antiaircraft
weapons and personnel, in suitable
position to defend the area. ;The training of
men to fire on hostile aircraft only when :
(1) The aircraft attack
(2) The attacking aircraft are within
range.
Fire on ,,aircraft which have' ,. not attacked
merely invites attack, and gives away the position,
or area and its extent, , This is especially
true of . hostile reconnaissance . planes, which,
when fired on, can ascertain the location and
extent' of the position and area and later return
with bombing formations .
g.
-
Manning of antiaircraft weapons at all
times, 'and posting of qualified air sentries in
carefully selected positions .
h. If the situation does not require otherwise,
artillery should remain ' silent when hostile'aircraft
are overhead.
i. Positive identification of aircraft is essential
before fire is opened. . The best identi-
67
division, 95% of all air attacks were -sus
tamed by the artillery. Certain lessons have .
been learned and certain principles of defense,
have received general concurrence by participating
units,
45. For positions, bivouacs, and assembly
areas, the following measures have been
proven effective against all types of air at
tack :
a . The use of every available means of concealment
and natural cover,
b. Effective camouflage measures, including
the use of all natural and artificial means .
In artillery units, the air observation aircraft
has proved invaluable for checking camou-,
flage and discovering defects .
c. Enforcement of the most rigid-- camouflage
discipline . It is not enough that a man .
observe proper discipline himself. He must,,
also take action to prevent others from 'committing
violations, since the safety of the command
is at stake.
d . Proper dispersion of vehicles, weapons,
and installations .
e. Proper digging in of personnel and materiel
whenever a position or area is to be
occupied for any length of time. Properly
66
l'
anise ;an re,, All otherpersonrielshould
dismoun al e'cover; and: fire every weapon'
that can`be':brought to bear on the aircraft.
A column, moving' through country subj
ect io air, attack ; should have all radios on
the 'command' channel ; with"" operators listening
Ak warning 'can be thus spread from one
end of the column to the other from' any point
which may be attacked .
c. When in â¢ march column and :air attack
is likely, the fire extinguishers should be loose
from their brackets, and ready to be taken
by the, assistant driver or occupant of the
cab, if the `vehicle' is evacuated . One man
should be defirntely responsible, for this func-
âtion Often an attack -is over very quickly,
and 'if the extinguisher is 'taken when the
vehicle is evacuated, measures can be taken
at`;onee, to `put out a fire : Otherwise the extinguisher
',ma .'become , enveloped m flames,
and the chance' of saving the : vehicle is, lost,
(:,'Spare; gasoline 'cans should, . not be carried'
in vehicles dispersed ."" throughout the
column during, daylight marches, unless the,
existing; situation' makes such procedure imperative.
~ ; Many 7N, ehicles! have been , lost,
""through spare' gasoline : cans 'being hit by' in
68
a
fication under such circumstances is attack ;,by
the aircraft. In the campaign, identification
was unsatisfactory, and in many, instances
friendly planes were fired on and hostile air-'
craft were allowed to pass within range unmolested.
46. Road movements, convoy, and marches
have been subject to all types of air attack.
The following defensive measures have been
found effective for protection and for mini : ,.
mizing losses :
a. Dispersion in column is the most .-, vital,
single principle. The maintenance' of proper
distance between vehicles is essential . 'A distance
of 150-250 yards, depending on the
terrain should be the minimum . Violation
of distance regulations invites disaster .'
b . An air lookout must be posted.' on each
vehicle. Each air guard must be in~position'
to observe in, a 360Â° direction . If this is not
possible on some vehicles, a front and rear
lookout should be posted . Lookouts should be
relieved at frequent intervals, to prevent men
from becoming inadvertently lax.
. c. When a column is attacked, normally, it
should halt, spread to both sides of the ; road,
and all mounted weapons should' remain
k`.
cendiary bullets from strafing planes. If
the spare cans are carried in one truck at the
end of the column, this one vehicle may, be
lost, but there is far better chance of others
not taking fire .
47 . The .50 caliber machine gun has proved
to be the most effective antiaircraft weapon
in most situations . It should be properly
dispersed throughout march columns and
carefully placed in troop positions and occupied
areas. Attached antiaircraft units have
been best employed by breaking them up into
platoons and assigning them to organizations,
especially to the artillery, which is most subject
to air attack.
48. Air attack has been generally ineffective
against armored vehicles. It has been reported
that even dive bombing has failed - to
cause much damage to medium tanks. Tanks; ',""
when attacked in this manner should continue
to move, zig-zag fashion . . Deployed
tanks can furnish their own air protection
in the armored division . Proper antiaircraft
weapons must be provided for headquarters
and . service personnel,

By eowcnd of Heutanont General CLARK :
Rcoap . of pertinent issues from inte_^viei .s with personnel of the lst
a rmored Division, !larch l, l,n , .5 .
1 . The need for a new telescopic, f_ocusable sight is pressing .
This new sight must provi C i-6 teleccopic pol er, a larger
reticule and some form of illurrai nation .
2 . Air-ground support has not yet approached the satisfactory
stage . Air support must he :made more available to ground
combat units to enable them ;,o exploit air-mission targets
of opportunity .
3 . Some pyrotechnic form of signal identification is necessary
to prevent friendly aircraft from destroying our own tanks .
Present markings must be retained to permit such restricted
ground identification as now exists .
4 . Gasoline-powered tani :s are regarded by their crews as firetraps
. The men greatly prefer the less inflammable Diesel
^o-:veered tank .
5 . Tank officers point to the need for a range quadrant which
could permit them to fire H, from their heavy guns at wide
ranges .
6 . The frequency of penetration by enemy shell-fire on the turret
of the t1-4 tank indicEtes t at the recess of indent tinn
formed thereon for the fitting of arpliances has dangerously
weakened the vehicles defensive armor--in a critical area .
7 . Our current system of aircraft identification is variously
regarded as useless and wart less . Armored units fire on aircraft
only ;hen attacked for fear of exposing themselves to
reprisal ri ve-bomber attack .

"and fixes the hostile force . By extending
over a broad front with its infantry and artillery, the
advance guard can deceive the enemy relative to strength
and movements .
c. oordination
In a meeting engagement in open terrain and when the
enemy has excellent observation, it is necessary to develop
and prepare for combat much earlier than otherwise .
The location of the main effort is promptly communicated
to the various columns, and they deploy in keeping with
58 GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
the general plan .in order to insure coordination of
effort. The prompt employment of additional artillery
support should be coordinated with the general scheme of
maneuver.
d . Methods
In attacking during a meeting engagement, alternative
methods exist for utilizing the main body : (a) prompt
employment as the units of the march columns reach the
immediate combat area ; (b) development, and occupation
of a position of readiness from which the attack will be
launched . In the first case, the units will be issued
individual orders as they arrive ."" All unit commanders
must insure coordination between their infantry and supporting
weapons . In the second case, the attack will be
conducted similarly to an attack against an enemy in
position. It will not be advantageous to push through
an attack immediately if the terrain is difficult or if the
employment of the mass of the force on the same day is
no longer possible . The action of neighboring units must
also be taken into consideration .
59. PURSUIT
The absolute disregard of all factors except the annihilation
of the hostile force will govern the conduct of the
pursuit. The most important principles involved are to
harass continually the hostile force in front and on the
flanks, and to block the avenues of retreat . It is most
important that the intention of the enemy to withdraw
s+ The situation may so develop that the immediate employment of units
as they arrive will not be necessary . The remainder will then be first moved
into positions of readiness .
THE ATTA K 59
be promptly recognized . 2 \When such recognition becomes
definite, the commander will immediately employ
all available force and spare no effort in order to annihilate
the enemy . Premature pursuit can result disastrously ; on
the other hand, if the withdrawing enemy is permitted
time in which to break off combat, an opportunity for
decisive victory may be lost ; the commander must therefore
carefully consider the situation and evaluate the
information prior to committing his troops to the pursuit,
ommanders of subordinate units in the forward echelon
push energetically forward when the enemy gives way .
The presence of higher commanders in these forward
units spurs the troops to greater effort .
Some of the important considerations for conducting
successful pursuits are : (a) Employ airforce units against
large bodies of hostile retreating troops ; use reconnaissance
planes to determine direction of withdrawal and use
diving attacks with machine guns and bombs upon troops
and materiel in marching columns, especially in defiles
and against bridges. (b) Employ artillery in harassing
missions . Let part of the long-range artillery pound
vigorously on potential avenues of withdraw tI, roads,
etc., and keep the bulk of the artillery leap-flogging
rapidly, pressing close behind the friendly infantry to
render support . (c) Employ infantry in pushing rapidly
forward literally on the heels of the withdrawing enemy' ;
assign distant objectives in the direction of the withdrawal
; have the heavy infantry weapons follow closely
the forward echelon ; and give the energy no time to organ-
' lues may be derived from airplane reports of rearward movements of
trains, supply, echelons, and reserves ; from reports from friendly troops ; and
from patrolling, particularly at night, and miscellaneous signal interceptions .
60
ize a defense . (d) Employ engineers to repair roads in
the rear of the pursuing forces, to remove obstacles, and
to neutralize gassed areas .
While the 'frontal attack is vigorously carried out,
enveloping forces of great mobility 26 will operate from
flank and rear against the hostile retreating columns .
Defiles, bridges, and favorable observation deep in rear
of the enemy will be seized, and avenues of retreat cut off .
If the enemy succeeds in organizing a delaying position,
a coordinated attack must be promptly arranged and
launched.
ommanders must insure a continual flow of supplies
for the rapidly advancing units . In pursuit, matters of
supply and evacuation require particularly careful supervision
.
Pursuing troops must maintain contact with the enemy,
and must report back frequently to headquarters their
own locations . If the pursuit continues into the night,
infantry units push forward along the roads . Artillery
continues long-range harassing fire, while individual batteries
follow the infantry in close proximity for rendering
immediate support .'
ss Motorized infantry, mounted troops, motorized engineers, and antitank
and antiaircraft units,
27 Artillery firing at night under such conditions is, of course, map firing .
GERL`A' TA TI AL DO TRINE Section XIII . THE DEFENSE
The important considerations of defense are combined
in utilization of terrain and coordination of fire . The
natural defensive characteristics of the terrain should he
improved, and camouflage should be used freely . A
fully coordinated use of all available weapons must be
arranged ; strength should be conserved by keeping the
losses in personnel and materiel down to the very minimum;
and exact dispositions, strength, and intentions
should be denied to the enemy as long as possible, A
well-organized defense capable of quickly and effectively
reverting to the attack, with cunning and deception
enshrouding the movements and dispositions, will offset
hostile numerical superiority,
60. FAVORABLE TERRAIN FOR DEFENSE
The defender has an advantage in that he selects the
terrain for his battle . Rarely will all of the following
terrain requirements for defense exist in a single combat,
area, but certain of them will be present, and the commander
may improvise the others : (a) good observation
for artillery and other supporting weapons ; (h) protection
against hostile observation ; (c) natural obstacles against
tank attacks ; (d) natural protection for flanks ; (e) possibility
for launching counterattacks .
61
62 GERMAN TA TI AL TPIIE
61 . OTHER ONSIDERATIONS
a . Defense or Delaying Action?
The mission must clearly indicate the form of defense
contemplated : defense (Verteidigung), meaning that the
position will be held under all circumstances ; or delaying
action (Hinhaitender Widerstand) . Fire may be opened
either at maximum-effective ranges, if the ammunition
is ample, or at closer ranges, in order to effect surprise .
b. Preparation of Defense Area
When the hostile situation has not been clarified
(especially if the direction of the enemy's attack is
unknown), the mass of the defending force should be
retained in a position of readiness . When information
relative to hostile formations, main effort, strength, etc .,
becomes, available, then the troops may be moved into
defensive positions which have been previously reconnoitered
and prepared according to the time available and
the situation . Occasionally only a skeleton position will
be occupied with artillery protected by small units of
infantry, while the mass is held back centrally located so
that it can quickly occupy positions upon the approach
of the enemy .
c. Maneuvers
Advanced positions and outposts delay him and give
time for the occupation and preparation of favorable
defense terrain . Reserves are used for flank protection,
for counterattacks, and for blocking penetrations . Fire
power must never be weakened by holding out unnecessarily
large reserves . If, after contact with the enemy, the
situation requires defensive maneuver, the position is
T E !)EFENsE t)V
quickly organized as the troops deploy, and if the, terrain
is not particularly favorable, the troops are drawn back to
better defensive terrain .
62. GENERAL PRIN IPLES OF DEFENSE
Some of the general principles of defense can be summarized
as follows : (a) The purpose of the defense is to
nullify the hostile attack . (b) The position selected is
held to the last ; the commander nay under certain circumstances,
however, restrict the time . (c) The defensive
position selected must compel the enemy either to
attack, relinquish the advance, or attempt to avoid colttbat
.28 (d) Hostile envelopments are countered by extending
or refusing the flank (or flanks), or by echeloninent
of reserves. (e) If the enemy attempts to utarclh
around in order to avoid the position entirely, then he
should be attacked .
63 . ORGANIZATION OF DEFENSE AREAS
a . Defense in Depth
The main battle position is organized in depth to
accomplish dense all-around fires and effectively limit hostile
penetrations . Local withdrawals before superior
hostile fire may be authorized by the regimental commander
to his battalion commanders, or, in special cases,
by the latter to their subordinates ; local withdrawals must
not, however, permit the loss of connection between units,
in the line or hostile penetration into the main battle zone .
In terrain not too unfavorable for the defense, units
as This can he accomplished it the position cuwot ie eiitirei I n1uided of enveloped by the enemy,
64 GERMAN TA TI AL DO TRINE
occupy fronts double the width of those assigned for the
attack . These islands of resistance are so organized as to
permit all-around defense, with weapons so sighted as to
cover all possible avenues of approach at maximum ranges .
The defensive zone is organized in depth, with the main
line of resistance in front of the terrain that is favorable
for observation posts-for the artillery and heavy supporting
weapons . The higher commander selects the general
defensive line on the map and assigns sectors to units .
Subordinate commanders carefully reconnoiter the terrain
and select the locations for their troops and various types
of weapons.
b . over and Obstacles
over for machine-gun emplacements, observation
posts, and accompanying weapons is provided . Obstacles
are constructed to supplement the natural defensive
characteristics of the terrain. Priorities of defensive
works are governed by the rule that ""effectiveness of fire
takes priority over cover."" The normal order of tasks is
the following :29 (a) clearing fields of fire and establishing
distances to increase the efficiency of fire ; (b) camouflaging
installations and erecting dummy establishments ;
(c) constructing splinter cover for observation posts ;
(d) constructing machine-gun emplacements ; (e) erecting
barbed wire or other obstacles ; (f) excavating dugouts,
switch positions, or planned communication routes .
64 . RESERVES, RELIEFS, AND REAR POSITIONS
Local reserves are used to fill in gaps in the line, to
counterattack against a local penetration, and to relieve
YÂ° Several of these tasks, such as camouflaging, nay be undertaken concurrently
with other tasks .
THE DEFENSE 65
troops in the front line . General reserves are used too
protect a flank, to counterattack against a serious penetration,
to counterattack when the situation indicates a
return to offensive tactics, and to relieve organizations
in the line .
A relief is only effected after a long period of defense,
and under cover of darkness . Infantry and artillery are
never relieved simultaneously . The relief order directs
when and where the relief is to report, the routes to be
used by the relieving force and the troops relieved ; and
the time when the new commander is definitely to assume
responsibility for the sector .
Only necessary under exceptional circumstances, rear
positions must be located sufficiently back from the main
line of resistance to require the enemy artillery to move
forward. A rear position will be ordered occupied by
the commander when the former position can be held only
with unjustifiable losses and when consideration for adjacent
units does not forbid.
65 . A TUAL OPERATION OF THE DEFENSE
a . Main Line of Resistance
All fires along the main line of resistance and in the
principal defensive zone are carefully coordinated to insure
that all areas, particularly the potential avenues of approach,
are covered by strong concentrations . Artillery
and infantry are coordinated to permit a rapid switch
from one area to another ; and fire plans are prepared to
limit penetrations and to block envelopments,
Defensive preparations are secured from hostile observation
by active reconnaissance and by a screening force,
both of which operate under the same colnnmander.
66
GERM AN TA TI AL DO TRINE
Generous use of obstacles, natural and constructed, is
made . The advanced troops are under direct control of
the commander ; after fighting in delaying action before
superior enemy forces, they withdraw to rearward positions
as prearranged by him .
b . Advance Position
The advance position, usually located within the sphere
of operation of friendly long-range artillery in the main
battle position, is occupied to prevent the early seizure of
important terrain features by the enemy . amouflage
and dummy works are used freely . The advance position
increases the effectiveness and the time of employment of
long-range artillery by protecting advanced, artillery
observation posts ; also, such a position deceives the enemy
relative to the dispositions and organization for defense,
and causes him to deploy prematurely . Friendly troops
must withdraw before the enemy can overrun the position .
In withdrawing, prearranged routes will be indicated to
insure that the fire of weapons located in the next position
to the rear (outpost line of resistance) is not masked .
c . Outpost Position
The outpost position, located within the sphere of operation
of the light artillery batteries in the main position,
is selected to provide time for troops manning the main
defensive position to prepare for action, to supplement
observation, and to deceive the attacker relative to dispositions
. Troops from infantry units immediately to the
rear generally occupy this line and are withdrawn by
signal according to prearranged plan so that fields before
the main line of resistance are not obstructed . Artillery
delays the hostile approach by the use of harassing fires
THIE DEFENSE 67
controlled by radio reports from advanced observation
posts . To increase radius of action, a few light batteries
may be advanced forward to locations between the outpost
line and the advance position .
66 . ARTILLERY IN THE DEFENSE
a . ontrol 6y Artillery ommander
The commander of the whole defensive force determines
the proportion of artillery to be held in direct support
and the proportion to be attached to infantry units .
Artillery is kept as far as possible under the control of the
artillery commander, who under all circumstances retains
control of the mass of the division artillery . If the situation
permits and there is an ample ammunition supply,
heavy fires may be delivered at long ranges .
6. Tactics
In the initial stages of a defensive action, artillery Iiw
sometimes be kept silent to facilitate deception : otl -Ier`~
it will be employed to draw hostile artillery fire, to deliver
counterbattery fires, or to bring down harassing fires en
the approaching hostile infantry . In the advanced stages
of a defensive action, the bulk of the artillery is used to
deliver concentrations on hostile positions of readiness,
and particularly on hostile heavy infantry vv'capons ; the
remainder ir, used to deliver counterbattery fire . And in
the final stage---when the hostile force is on the pmint of
launching its assault--the artillery delivers preparations
and barrages upon the hostile assault .
c. Barrage
Should the enemy make a surprise attack at night ov in
a fog, a barrage of all weapons is delivered irnunediately in
68 GERMAN TA 'T'I AL DO TRINE
front of the plain line of resistance . Definite restrictions
relative to coverage and duration of fire are issued ."" As a
rule, heavy artillery does not participate .
67 . INFANTRY IN THE DEFENSE
With part of their heavy weapons, the infantry opens
fire upon the approaching enemy at good distance ; if
friendly artillery support is weak, at maximum ranges .
Firing positions are located in advance of the main line of
resistance or in the forward part of the defensive area . As
the enemy draws closer, he is engaged by the fire of all the
defending heavy weapons, and finally by the fire of all
available weapons . The infantry fills up gaps in the line,
recapturing any sections temporarily lost .
68 . HOSTILE PENETRATIONS
Where small groups of the enemy have broken through,
the groups should be destroyed immediately . Box
barrages placed in their rear will preclude their withdrawal
. When a successful break-through of large proportions
has been accomplished by the enemy, the commander
of the defensive force will decide whether the
position will be shifted or the lost ground regained by
counterattack . If he decides to counterattack, the fires
of all weapons are carefully coordinated, a limited objective
is assigned, and air and tank support is provided .
69. THE OUNTERATTA K
It is most important that the psychological moment be
recognized for the counterblow . The commander is ever

meters (175 yards) ; a light battalion, about 500 meters (550 yards) .
THE DEFENSE O!)
alert for indications ."" The counterattack plan resenlhle~,
a limited-objective attack in which artillery support,
boundaries, and objectives are specified . Any objective
selected must be a decisive terrain feature.
70. WITHDRAWAL TO A REARWARD POSITION
Advance orders are issued to effect a withdrawal, thus
ensuring coordination . ontact, with adjacent units is
maintained . The movement to the rear is effected under
cover of darkness ."" Activity on the original position will
be simulated to deceive the enemy . Firing by part of the
infantry and artillery will be continued from the forwardd
position to give the enemy the impression that it is still
being strongly defended . The hostile advance upon the.
new (renewed) position will be delayed by the fire of
artillery and heavy weapons, supplemented by Iuealr; of
poison gas and obstacles .

""Daylight uithdratvals are only attempted under cover of fog, artificial
or natural, or over terrain of very restricted visibility, whim the ~iUmtinu

Section XIV. THE DELAYING A TION
The purpose of a delaying action is to effect maximum
delay to the enemy without committing the friendly force
to decisive action . It is employed to avoid breaking before
superior hostile force ; to gain time or to improve the
situation with reference to observation, cover, and field
of fire : and to maneuver the enemy into a position in
which lie may be more effectively attacked, If a transition
from defense to delaying action is imperative, the
first position selected should be at least 6 miles to the
rear. A fully coordinated attack by the enemy can be
checked by causing him to displace his artillery and to
reorganize generally before he launches a new attack .
The characteristic organization for delaying action includes
the following considerations : (a) Successive defensive
lines are selected with sufficient intervals to cause
displacelnent of the enemy's artillery . (b) Positions
selected should permit distant observation and effective
use of long-range weapons, and have cover in the rear to
facilitate withdrawal . (c) Natural obstacles are fully exploited
and supplemented by constructed obstacles and
by the use of poison gas. (d) The bulk of the artillery,
along with the long-range artillery, is held under the
artillery commander for long-range interdiction and
counterbattery missions . (e) Resistance in the forward
position is continued until the next rearward position is
occupied and fully prepared to carry on the defense .
(f) Units are deployed over very broad fronts and
70
with no depth .'
(g) Sniall reserves are retained . ihi
Reserves are utilized to cover the withdrawal i,urticulaily
by daylight (according to the situation and terrain, they
may be located off to a flank or on a commanding piece
or terrain, which facilities the protection of the unit,
drawing) . (ti) When the situation permits, withdrawals
are always made under cover of darkness ; sometinies, even
at the risk of being involved in serious action requiring
a strong defense, the situation should be held until
darkness.
33 In favorab4, terrain a unit may occupy a riclur Luicv a, a~ i,
normal for defense . In heavily wooded arena or whoa vikihilit v i~ r~tI ictc~f,
the sectors are narrower .
THB7 DN11A I:A'G :ktPrloA' 71
Section XV . RETREAT-RETIREMENT
In a retreat-retirement, contact with the enemy is
broken off for the purpose of seeking more favorable
terrain or conditions for the resumption of offensive
action . A commander may be forced by the trend of
circumstances to retire, or he may, of his own free will,
elect to retire . Only the greatest emergency is considered
to justify retreat . Local reverses should not be taken
seriously . No second-in-command upon receipt of unfavorable
information is authorized to order a retreat .
If the situation indicates the necessity, he must report to
a higher commander and state his intentions to retire
with the reasons therefor.
A retreat should be effected under cover of darkness,
with the greatest secrecy . If troops are told the purpose-
to improve their future chance of success-their
morale will not be adversely affected . Fresh troops if
available should be given the mission of rear and flank
guards to protect the assembly and movement of the
command . If the enemy is employing motorized or
mechanized troops, special provision will have to be
made to protect the Hanks with antitank weapons and
road blocks.

Section XVI . THE EMPLOYMENT OF FIELD
ARTILLERY
The division artillery coma antler is a sped 11 url` isor
to the division commander on artillery employnmnt,
replacement, and ammunition ; he is also conunander of
the artillery regiment, which includes the medium howitzer
battalion, the sound-and-flash battalion, and such artillery
as may be attached . He orders artillery concentrations,
counterbattery, and harrassing fire in cooperation with
the general scheme of maneuver and in support of the
infantry .
The artillery battalion is the fire unit. The battalion
commander indicates definitely to his batteries such
matters as the following : targets, aiming points, amounts
of ammunition to be fired, time for opening fire, location
of positions, ammunition supply, routes, types of fire,
and kinds of ammunition . Firing data are obtained for
the battalion by ranging shots, map computations, operations
of the observation battalion (sound-and-flash), and
references furnished by friendly troops . In very wide
sectors or when operating in terrain of restricted visihility,
it may be necessary for certain batteries to obtain
firing data individually according to their tactical missions,
71 . ORGANIZATION
Part of the artillery, usually the light howitzers, has
the principal mission of providing direct support to the
infantry . The remainder is employed in counterbattery,

is maintained . Disposition must be kept flexible
to permit quick shifting of battery positions, missions,

72. LO ATION IN THE ATTA K,
In general, in the attack the artiiicry is beat(tl innmediately
in rear of the infantry line, just beyond range
of hostile small-arms fire . Figure 1 shows a typical
arrangement, with the observation battalion (sound-andflash)
operating directly under the artillery eoninander .
If reconnaissance and combat intelligence have given
definite information about hostile dispositions, then a
preparation may be fired, continuing 10 to 30 minutes,
and depending upon the ammunition available, the . surprise
effect, and the situation . In the case wlhere practically
no information on the enemy is available, the
artillery preparation is omitted ; the infantry launches the
attack, drawing fire from hostile heavy weapons aril
artillery, upon which, once located, the friendly artillery
can thereafter fire .
73 . LO ATION IN THE DEFENSE
Artillery in the defense is organized the same, way ats iu
the attack . The only difference in . dispositions is that
the direct support weapons (light howitzers) are located
slightly farther to the rear, and the general support gusts
(medium hoe-itzers) are in a central location where they
can interdict at long ranges to force an early deploiuuunt
of approaching enemy formations .
74. OOPERATION WITH INFANTRY
Time and space must be carefully coordinated by but,h
the infantry and the artillery. It is essential that the
artillery observers be at all times alert, not only to locate
targets and hostile forces but to follow closely the movements
of friendly troops, particularly the infantry . To

facilitate this close contact, it devolves upon the infantry
to seize and hold terrain which offers excellent observation
for the artillery . ommunication is effectively maintained
. lose contact between infantry and artillery
officers is absolutely essential . The division commander
indicates, as promptly as possible, the plan of maneuver
to the artillery commander so as to permit the latter the

In the advance the artillery renders immediate support
to the infantry when contact with the enemy is gained .
This is accomplished by the artillery observers, who

neutralize the hostile resistance and open the way for the

prompt deployment for action contribute to the success
of this mission . It is generally advantageous for the
infantry to wait for the support of the artillery . It is
also important for the infantry to understand the limitations
and capabilities of the artillery .""

Dear Guy:
While I have talked with you on the subject of exhaustion neurosis
both real and artificial, it might be desirable if you had, for your
reference, a copy of the remarks I made to Burns last March, when I
handed over to him command of 1 Cdn Corps. Here is the extract from
my letter to him:
The next matter, which we have discussed on previous occasions,
has several angles to it, but each is part of the one general problem. That
general problem concerns the natural but, in the circumstances of war,
reprehensible objection of a small proportion of other ranks of 1 Cdn
Corps to risk death, or serious injury, for their country. The angles
include such things as desertion, self-inflicted wounds, attempts to be
diagnosed as exhaustion cases, VD re-infection and so on.
To my mind, this problem requires to be tackled in three ways. First
of all, the processes of disciplinary action should be tightened up and
speeded up. Secondly, punishment should be as severe as the
circumstances permit. Thirdly, by education, all ranks should be
brought increasingly to the view that escapism is a shameful thing.
My observation indicates that there is a general tendency amongst
forward units and formations to take the easy way out of this difficult
problem. If a man shows himself to be unreliable under fire, he is left
behind in the case of a fighting patrol and left out of battle in the case of
a unit action. While this tendency may ease the problem of the moment, it
Battle Exhaustion and Morale
139
offers no solution to it, indeed, it tends to add to it as every week goes by.
It follows that sub-unit and unit Commanders must, somehow, all be
persuaded to abandon this cant depend on the man so leave him
behind attitude.
The exhaustion neurosis problem also requires your attention.
Undoubtedly, a pretty high proportion of the cases which get back to the
General Hospital are real nervous breakdowns on the part of the unstable
mental characters. On the other hand, as it is not considered any
disgrace to be an exhaustion case it is becoming increasingly tempting
to lead-swingers and others, whose hearts are not in the war, to seek
this way out. While, therefore, the real shell-shock must be regarded
and treated as a casualty, I consider it very important that the mesch of
the administrative sieve should be so close that the fake exhaustion case
should be detected and held within your jurisdiction, should be suitably
punished and not allowed to get away with it.
Yours ever,

To All Formation Commanders 2nd Canadian Corps
1. Occasionally it may be possible to withdraw formations or units from
contact for short periods of rest. In the present stage of the war in
general and the campaign in Normandy in particular, I cannot guarantee
how long or how frequent such periods of rest may be. When
opportunities occur, it is of great importance that troops should derive the
utmost benefit from periods out of contact and the following notes are
intended for guidance of commanders and commanding officers.
2. During the rest periods there are three objectives which must be
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
140
Battle Exhaustion and Morale
141
attained:-
(a) Enhance Morale  During periods of close contact
the standards of personal cleanliness, feeding and physical wellbeing
tend to deteriorate. Troops also tend to contract a mental
inertia. The combination of danger, monotony and poor living
conditions during less active periods in close contact can have a
deleterious effect on fighting spirit. The primary object of all
measures must be to restore to the highest possible level, physical
and mental well being and alertness.
(b) Re-Organization, Proper Absorption of
Reinforcement Personnel  When strengths of units include a high
proportion of reinforcements, sub-units lack esprit-de-corps and
there is a loss of the cohesion characteristic of a well-drilled battle
team. The re-posting of officers, new NCOs and specialists and reorganization
of battle teams can best be done when troops are free
to re-train.
(c) Training  The re-training and welding of sub-units
into battle teams. Through analysis, study and absorption of the
lessons learned from operations and the exchange of ideas between
officers and NCOs. Study of problems in connection with probable
future operations.
Enhancing Morale
3. Rest will not be interpreted as leaving the soldier to himself to
do nothing or as a time for relaxing of discipline and indulgence in
licence. Actually it is the strain of being under fire in forward areas and
the drain on physical strength without having enough to fully occupy the
soldiers mind, from which the troops suffer the most during long but
comparatively inactive periods of contact. The following measures will be
included during rest periods:-
(a) The first twenty-four hours out of the line, the soldier
should be left to himself to write his letters, sort out his kit, get
himself clean and have a really good sleep.
(b) After the first twenty-four hours a proper daily
routine must be instituted which will fill the soldiers day. Firstly,
meticulous attention will be given to the details of discipline 
correctness and cleanliness of turn-out, saluting, general smartening
up and physical training. Remember the golden rule for the
disciplinarian Look after the little things and the big things will
look after themselves.
(c) Officers and Sgts Messes should be re-formed on a
regimental basis; when reinforcement officers and new NCOs have
been absorbed, tremendous value is obtained from contacts in
regimental messes.
(d) Each day commanding officers should have all their
officers together for an hour and advantage should be taken of this
time to pass down through the unit the regimental outlook and spirit
which the commanding officer wishes to be carried throughout the
battle. Tactical discussions and TEWTs should also be included in
this period.
(e) For at least one hour every day platoon and
equivalent commanders should be able to have all their men
together for an instruction on such matters as discipline, care of
weapons, regimental customs, traditions; the progress of the war;
the war in the air and how the RAF has assisted operations on the
ground; the part the division has played in its operations; where and
how the sub-unit plays its part in the war effort as a whole; the
relation of the soldier to the civilian population of occupied
countries and the importance of proper conduct in relation to the
local inhabitants. All of these subjects should be taught at the
platoon level and instruction of this type is one of the best
opportunities offered to the platoon commander to sell himself to
his men.
(f) Organized games and sports are of tremendous value
and all should be able to participate in these.
(g) Properly organized sight-seeing parties in charge of
an officer may be taken on conducted tours of places of interest, but
individual officers or soldiers will NOT be permitted on pass in
local towns. Much value can be derived by exchange visits
between units to places where actions have taken place, an officer
who took part describing the battle and conducting the tour.
Entertainment will be arranged within units  concerts should be
organized, bands will be available and the facilities of the Auxiliary
Services. Properly organized unit canteens may be instituted when
this is practicable. Drinking by soldiers in their bivouac lines will
not be countenanced. This requires careful checking when stocks of
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
142
Battle Exhaustion and Morale
143
local wines are easily obtainable.
(h) As far as operational requirements permit,
individuals or small groups should arrange exchange visits between
Allied Regiments of the British Army or Visits to the Royal Navy or
Royal Air Force.
Training
4. Training should be concentrated on the section, platoon and company
level. These are the sub-units which suffer most by dilution as a result of
wastage. Battle teams must be re-organized, trained and re-built on the
nucleus of experienced personnel. Particular attention must be given to
the care and handling of weapons.
Training with the troops should not be attempted above the unit level, and
only above the company even when time permits, but each Headquarters
should set its house in order as a result of its battle experiences.
Formations should organize officers discussions on the lessons learned
during operations and pool their knowledge and experience for the benefit
of all.
5. When troops can be collected together, I wish to visit them myself and
have an opportunity personally to congratulate them and show them how
their achievements have played their part in the bigger strategical
conceptions of the present campaign.

FIGHTING STRENGTHS
1. I have checked the figures of our deficiencies in unit establishments
with the figures for battle casualties and there is a marked discrepancy
between the two.
2. Records show that this discrepancy is not attributable to sickness,
which is low throughout the Corps. It may be attributable to the
following causes, and I consider that this matter must receive the personal
attention of all commanders and commanding officers:
(a) Battle Exhaustion
Medical officers may be inclined to take a lenient view of so termed
battle exhaustion cases. It requires the close attention of
commanders to see that malingering is not only discouraged, but
made a disgraceful offence and disciplinary action taken to counter
it. Battle exhaustion may be an acute problem under the most
adverse fighting conditions  winter, bad living conditions and bad
feeding resulting from small parties of troops having to fend for
themselves  the drabness of static warfare with its inevitable drain
on morale. It is quite inexcusable under the conditions in which we
have been fighting in the last few weeks.
(b) Straggling and Absenteeism
I am certain there is some straggling and absenteeism in units for I
have seen soldiers in villages far from the area in which their unit is
fighting. Though in some cases these may be Rear Echelon
personnel, I am satisfied that some are not. Firm disciplinary
action is necessary on the part of commanding officers to deal with
absenteeism or straggling. This is particularly important now that
we are moving through a country where the civil population is
present in the towns and villages and through the countryside. It is
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
144
a great temptation to the soldier who is weary, especially if plied
with wine by the ill considered friendliness of local civilians, to take
24 to 48 hours away from duty.
3. I appreciate the problem which faces unit commanders who have a
high proportion of reinforcement officers, short of regimental experience
and with little opportunity to get to know their men before they are
actively engaged with the enemy. Whilst I understand the difficulties, I
will not condone malingering or straggling and I request that you will
give your personal attention to this matter and take active steps to see
that disciplinary action is taken and examples made wherever offences
occur. The reinforcement situation being what it is, every serving soldier
must be made to pull his weight whether or not he may feel temporarily
disciplined to do so.

All Commanders,Canadian Formations
ABSORBTION OF REINFORCEMENT PERSONNEL
1. Occasionally I have had instances reported to me purporting to prove
that the training of reinforcement officers and soldiers on joining their
units in the field, has been wrong, or inadequate. I am satisfied that most
of the officers now responsible for training and testing remustered
personnel, or drafts arriving from Canada, are officers who have had
considerable infantry fighting experience in this war, know what is
required and all are conscientious in their duty. I have discussed this
problem with some Commanding Officers and senior Formation
Commanders and I believe that the way in which reinforcements are
posted within units has much to do with their unsatisfactory performance
in cases where they have fallen short of expectations. I do not believe
that Commanding Officers have given enough consideration to the human
Battle Exhaustion and Morale
145
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
146
aspects of the problems.
2. Commanders and Commanding Officers must realize that when the
reinforcement officer or soldier joins the unit with which he is going to
fight, it is one of the great moments in his life  comparable with birth,
marriage or death. The position of a new reinforcement joining a unit is
quite different from that of a soldier who has served with a unit for a
considerable time and goes into battle beside officers and NCOs who
have trained him and with men whom he knows. The reinforcement
(unless he is a recovered casualty returned to his own unit) comes as a
stranger. Regardless of how thorough his preliminary training may be, in
the stress of his first battle, he may react in a way contrary to his training
unless steps have been taken to win his confidence. It is well known, and
only human, that the experienced fighting soldier is inclined to lay it on
a bit thick in describing his battle experience to the new arrival. This
adds to the tension under which the inexperienced soldier goes into his
first engagement. He may do things in the stress of the moment which
afterwards he may well realize were contrary to what he had been taught.
3. Unless proper steps are taken within a unit, the reinforcement officer,
or soldier, goes into action as an individual rather than as a member of a
unit team.
4. Commanding Officers will take steps to ensure that their unit
arrangements for the reception and absorbtion of reinforcement officers
and soldiers are properly organized. Reinforcement personnel arriving at
a unit must:-
(a) Be made to feel that they are part of the unit and no
longer just individuals. A responsible officer who has served with
the unit for some time must interview them and explain the practical
side of soldiering in the field and make the new arrival feel that he
belongs there. If this matter is properly handled, confidence is won
from the outset and each man feels that he has become part of a unit
which takes an interest in him.
(b) Have a final check over of their individual weapon
training and be given a few talks from experienced officers and
NCOs, on practical pointers.
(c) Be given time to adjust themselves to their new
surroundings before they are faced with action itself.
5. I have previously issued instructions that every infantry battalion and
Battle Exhaustion and Morale
147
armoured regiment shall have a strong left out of battle party, including
2ICs and selected officers, NCOs and men. From this left out of battle
party can be formed the unit reception school to deal with arriving
reinforcements. If properly organized within the unit, this party should be
able to provide just the type of officer and NCO needed to test and initiate
the new soldier. I am satisfied that the means to handle this problem are
there, if there is proper organization within the unit.
6. Except in extreme emergency, i.e. when it is a question of winning or
losing, a battle, reinforcements will NOT be posted into fighting echelons
in infantry battalions, or armoured regiments until they have spent a
minimum of forty-eight hours in the LOB [left out of battle] school. I
stress forty-eight hours as the minimum. Four or five days is preferable,
whenever operation circumstances allow.
7. Whilst during prolonged active periods, the urge may be very strong to
bring up to strength depleted fighting echelons as soon as a draft of
reinforcements arrives, I am convinced that if the steps are taken, which I
have outlined above, a far greater fighting value will accrue to the unit
and casualties will be fewer.
8. I fully appreciate that during the period of intensive activities through
which we have been going that Commanding Officers have had little time
to think about things other than the battle in which they are engaged.
But, once proper arrangements have been made for reinforcement
absorbtion, and a unit reception school formed, the senior LOB officer
can command it.

CHAPTER 6
The Rhineland Battles and the
Liberation of the Netherlands
The operations carried out by 2nd Canadian Corps in the fall of 1944 had
placed enormous pressure on frontline soldiers. From 20 September to
7 November, 6,784 men were wounded and 3,244 reported killed or
missing in action. An additional 949 men were treated for battle exhaustion and
5,008 were evacuated to hospital as sick. These losses, 14 percent of the total
strength of the Canadian component of 21 Army Group, were heavily
concentrated in the 21 infantry battalions. Using the conservative figure of 70
percent as the proportion of losses in infantry units produces the conclusion that
more than 60 percent of the men serving in infantry battalions in mid-September
became casualties in the next seven weeks.1 Despite these losses the flow of
replacements resulted in a gradual increase in the strength of the infantry
battalions as men retrained from other arms were added to the reinforcement pool.
By February 1945 2nd Canadian Corps was at full strength with an adequate
replacement reserve including the 12,908 conscripts who had been sent overseas.2
The manpower problem was not the only issue that needed to be resolved
in the aftermath of the Scheldt battles. The morale of many combat soldiers had
declined dramatically in October 1944 as attrition warfare in the most miserable
conditions yet encountered took its toll. On 28 October Simonds issued his
directive on the Absorption of Reinforcement Personnel (see previous chapter)
and welcomed the appointment of an Advisor in Psychiatry at corps headquarters.
Major Burdett McNeel was asked to organize a series of talks to be given to
battalion officers and NCOs as well as Padres and medical officers. McNeel took
a common sense, jargon-free approach. He discovered a supportive atmosphere at
corps headquarters and receptive audiences in the infantry battalions.3
The task allocated to the corps in the winter of 1944-45, defence of the
Maas River line and the Nijmegen salient, allowed for 48-hour leaves and periods
of rest as a break from winter patrols and training. This pattern, together with the
announcement of the war services gratuity component of the Veterans Charter,4
produced the necessary improvement in morale, and Simonds was confident that
the corps was again ready for large-scale operations.
Simonds did not attempt to imitate Montgomerys leadership style by
addressing large groups of soldiers directly, but he continued to speak to the
officers of his corps at conferences called to outline events and describe the
challenges confronting the corps. A summary of one such talk to senior staff
officers and brigade commanders is reproduced below, but Simonds also held a
conference at the Wintergarden Cinema in Nijmegen for all officers serving on the
staff of corps headquarters to express his appreciation for the manner in which
administrative details had been carried throughout the Corps He expressed his
heartiest felicitations for the coming Christmas season and wished that shortly
after the turn of the year we would see peace.5
Canadian generals were not involved in the increasingly bitter Anglo-
American strategic debate, but First Canadian Army was to play a major role in
the destruction of enemy forces on the west bank of the Rhine. Montgomerys
21 Army Group, with Ninth U.S. Army (Lieutenant-General Bill Simpson) under
command, was to launch converging attacks under the code names VERITABLE
and GRENADE. VERITABLE, directed by First Canadian Army, was to begin on
8 February 1945 with GRENADE scheduled to start two days later.
The timing was ambitious. GRENADE could not begin until British
troops had cleared part of the start line, a strongly defended triangle between the
rivers Maas and Roer. Operation BLACKCOCK began on 16 January and the
10 day struggle in boggy countryside produced some of the fiercest fighting of the
war, a fitting introduction to the Rhineland battles.6 Eisenhower also wanted First
U.S. Army to seize the Roer dams to prevent the enemy from flooding the river at
an opportune moment. This attack, which began on 30 January, turned into
another slow slogging match. As American troops approached the dams the
Germans opened the discharge valves, flooding the Roer and increasing the speed
of the current so that the river was impassable until the reservoirs were empty.7 As
a result, GRENADE was to be postponed for almost two weeks.
General Harry Crerar and the staff of First Canadian Army had been
preparing for VERITABLE since November. The original plan, to launch the
offensive with Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks 30th Corps and use 2nd
Canadian Corps in a defensive role, had been modified under pressure from
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
150
Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds who argued, to leave the Canadians out of so
important and so decisive a battle would be a bitter disappointment to the troops.8
The troops were not asked if they agreed with Simonds views, but he won his
case, and both Canadian infantry divisions were assigned to 30th Corps for the
opening phase of the battle.
When VERITABLE had first been planned, German fortifications at the
northern end of the Siegfried line had none of the formidable character of the main
sections further south. By February a great deal of work had been done in
strengthening the positions. Three defensive belts confronted the Allies, each
from 500 to 1,000 metres wide. The first, on the edge of the Reichswald forest,
covered the 10-kilometre gap between the Maas and the town of Wyler. North of
Wyler the flood plain of the Rhine, covered in several feet of water from the blown
dykes, provided another kind of obstacle. Through the heart of the Reichswald
and south along the Maas, the Siegfried line itself presented a position that could
cause trouble if not quickly breeched. A third belt stretched from the Rhine near
Rees to Geldern.9 The extensive squares of forest, which made up the
Reichswald, were an obstacle in their own right, but perhaps the greatest asset the
Germans possessed was the weather. When Montgomery had first outlined
VERITABLE, he had expressed the hope that dry or hard ground would be
available. If these conditions exist, he told his commanders, then the basis of
the operations will be speed and violence. The aim will be to pass armoured
columns through to disrupt and disorganize enemy resistance in the rear. But he
cautioned, If the ground is wet and muddy, then a slower and more methodical
progress may be forced upon us.10 By February the ground was very wet and very
muddy. Rain and grey skies covered the battlefield keeping air operations to a
minimum and giving promise that progress would be slow.
As VERITABLE began, the German High Command (OKW) retained
responsibility for the direction of the defence of the Rhineland limiting the options
available to General Schlemms 1st Parachute Army. Initially OKW was
convinced that this was not the main Allied offensive, and all that Schlemm could
do was dispatch the balance of 7th Parachute Division to the Reichswald. He also
ordered the creation of a new defensive line, Cleve-Kessel-Gennep, but did not
attempt to protest Hitlers predictable demand that no fortified position was to be
given up without his personal permission.11
On 10 February OKW agreed that VERITABLE was the main operation,
sending 47th Panzer Corps, with 116th Panzer and 15th Panzer Grenadier
Divisions under command, to an assembly area near Uedem to prepare a corpslevel
counter-attack designed to regain the high ground west of Cleve. According
to a senior staff officer of the panzer corps, the dark night and strong harassing
151
The Rhineland Battles and the Liberation of the Netherlands
fire on crossroads and important terrain points by the enemy artillery made it
impossible to assemble the divisions in time, and the attack did not get underway
until 0930 hours, 13 February. The British recognized the German attack, met it
energetically and soon were able to commence their own attack. After a daylong
battle the British broke through at the seam between the panzer divisions, forcing
a withdrawal. That night both sides, exhausted by the struggle, ceased to mount
new attacks, accepting the reality that a temporary stalemate had developed.12
The original plan for VERITABLE had been based on two premises: the
ground would be sufficiently hard (frozen) to permit tank brigades to manoeuvre
freely, and the American attack, Operation GRENADE, would be launched shortly
after the assault, preventing the Germans from committing enough additional
troops to stabilize their northern front. Within 48 hours of launching the attack it
was clear that the ground was so soggy from the thaw and deliberate flooding that
there would be no breakout by the armoured units. And, by the afternoon of
12 February Horrocks was informed that the American attack would have to be
delayed for at least another week because the Roer River was impassable.
VERITABLE had not been designed as another slogging match for
21 Army Groups infantry divisions. Churchills decision of December 1944 to
add an additional 250,000 men to the strength of the British Army gave promise
of solving some of the British reinforcement problem, but the worst shortages
were in junior officers, shortages that could not be overcome with men hastily
transferred from other arms.
The British army had solved its earlier shortage of junior officers by
borrowing more than 600 young Canadians under the terms of the CANLOAN
agreement.13 By February 1945 all available Canadians were serving with British
units and the War Office was forced to authorize Immediate Emergency
Combatant Commissions for the infantry and armoured corps. Outstanding NCOs
could be commissioned without attending officer training schools if the
operational situation demanded it. By the end of the first week of VERITABLE,
30th Corps had suffered 2,400 casualties, including 126 officers,14 a situation that
required both emergency commissions and a new operational plan.
Guy Simonds, who was able to observe the battle while waiting for
30th Corps to release his Canadian infantry divisions, understood the need for a
new approach and tried to persuade Crerar and Montgomery to reconsider
VERITABLE. He proposed an expansion of Operation WALLSTREET, the code
name for an idea developed by Major-General G.H.A. Macmillan and the staff of
49th British Division. Macmillans battalions had been patrolling the island, the
partially flooded area between Nijmegen and Arnhem since late December. On
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
152
18 January, 56th Brigade, working with a squadron of Sherbrooke Regiment
tanks, occupied the town of Zetten after a bitter battle with elements of a German
parachute regiment. Zetten was just a few kilometres from the Rhine over
relatively dry ground, and Macmillan began to think seriously about crossing the
river and taking Arnhem.15
When Simonds heard about WALLSTREET he met with Macmillan and
went away to prepare an appreciation and plan for a corps-level operation in
which both 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Divisions would follow 49th across the
Rhine to expand the bridgehead beyond Arnhem.16 Corps engineers would build
bridges capable of sustaining the advance. Simonds was certain that
WALLSTREET would force the enemy to respond, weakening the resistance in
front of 30th Corps and thus altering the course of the Rhineland battle and
perhaps the war.
Simonds presented an outline to Crerar on 14 February17 but it was quickly
rejected. Montgomery had visited the VERITABLE front on 11 February to see
the conditions for myself. His nightly message to Brooke suggested that enemy
resistance was weakening and the whole problem was one of opening up road
centres and developing communications. He reported that he had instructed to
regroup and come up on a two corps frontage the postponement of GRENADE
may be for longer than we think and this makes it very necessary for VERITABLE
to be given all the strength that can be collected. The next day his message
acknowledged that resistance to VERITABLE was increasing with most of the
available German reserves drawn into the battle, but he remained determined to
put all the strength into Veritable and go on driving hard to the southeast.18 Crerar
did ask Simonds to keep WALLSTREET under consideration so that it might be
undertaken without delay once the objectives of Veritable have been secured,19
but this was small consolation. Simonds knew that both 6th and 7th Parachute
divisions were firmly committed to the Rhineland battle and there were few
German divisions left holding the river west of Arnhem.20

Training Circular No 3 Employment of Larger
Armored Units 94
TG 3
Training Circular WAR DEPARTMENT
No 3
Wa ;;hington May 6 94
Employment of larger armored units -- Purpose and
scope --Pendingthe publication of pertinent doctrine
in FM 00- 5 the broad policies governing the employment
of large components of the Armored Force independently
or in combined operations are announced herein
This publication supplements the doctrine announced in
Training Circular No 4 War Department 940 which has
particular application to the armored division and GHQ
tank battalions and pertinent paragraphs of Training
Circular No 0 War Department 940 See also Training
Circular No 0 War Department 94
2 Methods of employing elements of the Armored
Force --Operations of components of the Armored Force
may at various times or simultaneously involve--
-
a The attachment of GHQ tank battalions and groups
to infantry cavalry and armored divisions or corps
b The grouping of'armored-divisions corps or GHQ
tank groups with other corps or field armies for combined
operations
c The employment by the field or theater commander
of armored divisions and corps on independent or
se-ii -independent missions without reinforcing logistical
means or additional supporting troops other than reconnaissance
aviation
d Operation as task forces wherein armored divisions
or corps or at times GHQ tank units are teamed
with motorized divisions antitank battalions antiaircraft
automatic weapons battalions and GHQ engineer
maintenance and supply units closely supported by combat
aviation parachute and other troops transported by
air
3 General considerations --Larger units of the
Armored Force properly utilized either separately or
in combination with other means can achieve rapid decisive
results in the area of employment They are to
be employed on decisive missions They must not be
frittered away on unimportant objectives Missions far
in advance of other main forces are justified when the
operation will obtain decisive results but should be
closely supported by other equally mobile troops (see
par 4) Proper utilization necessitates definite appre
;iation and careful consideration of the following :
'I'C 3
-2-
a Those conditions which should exist or be created
for successful action ; such as air superiority in the
decisive area of employment surprise favorable terrain
and absence of or neutral :izat-on of massed defensive
means
b The mobility of armored units permits great latitude
in choice of direction and method of attack Decision
as to whether the attack will be executed as a
turning movement envelopment or penetration will be
largely determined by the time factor involved and by
terrain and hostile_ dispositions including rear installations
The most suitable areas for employment are on
open flanks or through existing gaps created by penetrations
c The assignment of missions or objectives to ar--
mored units must be preceded by a careful consideration
of the more important factors affecting operation of
the armored and other units associated in the operations
These factors are : weather ; terrain throughout the -
entire area of contemplated operation; nature of the
enemy and his methods of combat; availability of other
supporting troops; and especially adequate space and
road net for the operation of the units concerned The
axis of advance of major armored and motorized units
will be along roads
do Most decisive results will be gained from the
grouping of overpowering masses of armored units and
launching them against vital objectives deep in the
hostile rear The armored mass must be supported by
sufficient means to maintain momentum until attainment
of the objective
c Most effective and decisive application of the
mobility and power of large armored and motorized combii;
ations will often sceessitate uecentral :iza{âion of
control to the appropriate commanders who will be guided
only by the broad general plan of the higher headquarters
After the initiation of - the- operation however -
the superior commander must keep armored unit commanders
constantly informed of the situation
f Maximum development of the demoralizing power of
larger armored 'formations will be dependent in a large
measure on continuous support of adequate reconnaissance
and observation aviation and timely assistance of combat
aviation in overcoming critical ground resistance
N yond the ability of available artillery This should
-3 --
TC 3
be assured by direct arrangement between air and armored
unit commanders and by adequate air-ground signal communication
nets Higher commanders can enhance the effectivenesS
of supporting aviation by habitually assigning
the same components to operational teams or task
units
F Sustained mobility of armored and motorized
units is dependent upon adequate timely replenishment
of required supplies especially fuel and to a lesser
degree oil and lubricants Regular vehicle maintenance
must be continued When operations are to be prolonged
for several days it must be appreciated that armored
and motorized units must have opportunity for daily
maintenance See also paragraph 8d
h Because of their mass employment armored and
motorized units are difficult to conceal during approach
and development Elaborate measures for deception and
surprise will often be required and may involve variously:
advance stockage and concealment of essential supplies
; improvising and concentrating dummy_ armored vehicles
or marked activity of actual units in localities
distant from that of contemplated employment ; extensive
camouflage work; and rapid shifting of armored masses
to the area of decisive attack
4 A task force is a temporary tactical grouping
composed of one or more arms or services formed - for a
specific mission or operation The operation of large
armored formations will frequently dictate the organization
of task forces The composition of such forces
should be decided only after careful estimate of the
associated means required to accomplish the projected
mission or opcratian This estimate must consider the
nature of the expected resistance the distance to which
operations are projected the terrain to be traversed
and the troops available for the operation The additional
means to be associated with armored elements
will vary with each situation but may comprise appropriately:
infantry divisions foot or motorized or
components thereof ; cavalry units ; engineers ; combat
aviation ; parachute troops ; other troops transported by
air ;",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maj . Gen. Ernest N. Harmon's Notes on Combat
Experience During the Tunisian and African
Campaigns
NOTES ON COMBAT EXP MINâ¢ICE
DURING THE TL NISIAN1 AID AFFICAN --AMPAICNS
By Major General E . N. Harmon
1. Most Essential Requirements for Combat :
In general,â¢ our tactical doctrines are sound, the only requirement being
to place greater emphasis on some points and less emphasis on others . We need not
bow to any other ccuntry as to our military preparation . The Germans are superior
to us mainly in their thoroughness and greater discipline . I feel that we are
inc-lined to attempt to cram too much into the common soldier . Instead of teachirg
him .a few fundamental things thoroughly, we attempt to cover too wide a field, ::i â¢h
the result that when he arrives in the combat zone, he really is not thoroughly
I
compatent in anything and has to learn some of the most essential lessons in the
combat zone. I consider the following five points to b I he most essential req;iire--
ments for combat
'
a. Thorough and Completec Trininp for the Idiidld f Sll
basianvua anorma
Units.
This includes not only the, elementary basic training of the soldier
in all subjects such as discipline, camouflage, dispersion, sanitation, use of
cover, etc ., but above all, the use of his :reapons - perfection in ma rksmanship
and crew drill. Tank battles are usually won by the tanker who gets the first
shot in. Speed and accuracy are essential . Crew handled weapons must be worked
'at night and under heavy fire with speed, accuracy and without second thou at --
aatomaica 11
The leadership and responsibility of the small unit leaders as the
squad and platoon, the perfection of the training of : these units' must, be given -._
_greater emphasis and . less emphasis placed on the - dperation of the larger units
such as_ battalion, regiment, . and division. The division mâ¢ir11 succeed only as he
ilaoon succeeds.
b. Development of the Offensive Spirit and Eagerness to Close with the
In the consideration of this subject we are up against one of the
imponderables . We never know just how green troops and officers will act . We may
be assured, however, that the first time in battle all officers and men will be
considering their own safety, more or less, rather than the duty which they have
to perform. Confidence in battle comes with experience, with leadership, with
comrades and weapons . It is absolutely necessary to inculcate a disciplined fighting
spirit with a realization that a price must be paid for success and the
ingness on the part of the individual officer and soldier to sacrifice himself to
gain the objective . Nen must be taught that every shell and bomb is rot necessaxiJ_â¢,
directed at them personally, that they all have a good chance to survive regaiv:le3
of the intensity of hostile fire, and that whether or rot they survive ; someone has
to pay a price if success is to be gained. iie must build up the dignity, resour::3-
fulness and responsibility of the noncommissioned officer and junior officer in '
preparation for hi3 duties on the battlefield .
IIf
possible, green troops should be put into a relatively easy fight
the 'first time . Some troops - who are forced to enter a se-rcre b .'ttle for the first
time, and suffer heavy losses, do net seem to recover frori it for a long time or
until practically all of the original men have left -the unit . A man becomes a
good soldier only when he put his duty above his nersonâ1 safety . This is something
that can't be taught . On the other hand, strange as it may seem there
comes a time when men become battle weary, and then it is better to have fresh,
vigorous men than to have tired, experienced soldiers . This time comes earlier
with some men than with others depending upon the mans character, but it eventually
comes with s31 of them and must be recognized and watched . If a man has
taken part in many battles and has seen his original squad and platoon mates killed. .
or wounded down to the point where only he and one or t-w-.) others are left, he get_i
a mental complex that it is just a question of time until they will get hi-ra, and
he. begins to think about himself again. At this stage a fresh soldier fulll of
enthusiasm, but with less experience, is much more valuable .
c. Development of Leadership .
ier_rm_wi-11---fo11o_ww a good leade
conditions of battle . Therefore, the placing in position of leadership of the_
ri
men isth-emostÂ° important safeguard for success in battle that a commander
can have . Leadership is a natural gift . . Some men have it to a very high degree,
and others do not have it at all,. We must be ruthless in weeding out and changing
officers and men around so that the leaders are in the positions of leadership,
and the others, regardless of their personal qualifications, are put elsewhere .
Up to the time of battle itself, we are inclined to stress administration, paper
;cork, and tactical knowledge above the flare for leadership . T-n this we are
1:'herever possible before battle we must select the natural leaders, and where the
are weak in administration or in tactical knowledge, take pains to develop them.
We must place the other officers, regardless of how high their qu ali fications are,
,in staff-jobs or in positions where they are not in contact with the men .
After the first battle, the premium on leadership will be placed
higher . by all division commanders than it ever was before . In addition to
selecting the leaders we must also provide the ""second and third stringers"" as we
s,-:,y in football . I consider this ache most important c~ :.-ty of a division commander,
_- d where time is available, the division commander should not hesitate to investigate
as far. doin as the platoon commanders to see, by personal contact, that the
man has the qualifications to lead his platoon and inspire their confidence and
the willingness to close with the enemy .
In my last battle I lost two regimental commanders, nine battalion
commanders, and forty-three company commanders in the space of twenty days, which
illustrates the need for second and third string replacements to step promptly
into the job and carry on. A well trained and coordinated division and any unit,
for that matter, works on the same principle as a championship football team.
each man must know his job, there must be perfect teamwork, and there must be good ~
substitutes to replace the injured men without weakening the team . There_,- mt be

d . Develop Teamwork and Coordinate with All Weapons and arms of Service .
Some of the more important points under this heading are the coordination
of infantry weapons with the artillery . There is a great tendency to let the
artillery do the job . The infantry mortar and assault guns are closer to the front
and subjected to heavy fire, and they often suffer heavy casualties . For this
-
reason there is a tendency to have them remain silent so as not to draw fire,
and let the artillery carry the burden of close in fires as well as the moredistant
fires . This, of course, is wrong as the infantry weapons are designed to
bring close and accurate fire on areas that are difficult to reach by the artillery
and on targets that are difficult to describe for the artillery . The effect of
the artillery fire is thus minimized and not placed on targets -where it should be
and which cannot be reached by the shorter range infantry weapons . The massing o_2
all fires on given areas cr targets is most important .
The successful defense of the Anzio Beachhead can probably be
attributed more to the successful application of massed artillery fires than toany
other cause . This was not true in the early stages of the beachhead but was
a development as time went on . The sudden concentration of a terrific volume of
fire on a target usn-tlly insures a complete annihilation of the enemy at that
point or the complete-neutralization of his effort and is far superior to nibbling
away by one battery or one battalion . The fire of all weapons within range should
be adjusted so that all. can be brought to bear with a maximum volume of fire. We
welcomed news of an enemy counterattack forming, for under the system of massed
fires the enemy was given a terrific punishment .
The coordination of artillery and infantry includes, above all else,
the location of fonrarl observers up vrith front line companies and platoons and
dual means of coln!n nication . We learned not to depend on radio entirely, but
wherever the situation permitted and wire was avail able in the theater, to provide
the artillery observers with both radio and wire co mmunications . Puny times the
radio has been put out of action and the wire cut, but with dual corm unications
there still was maintained the vita]. communications so essential .
The coordinated teamplay between tanks and infantry is very poorly
understood and executed except in armored divisions . It is surprising lo-,,r lir .:le
:_vision and higher commanders understand the proper teamplay between the tanks
..,d the infantry. Training in this vital teamwork has riot been properly stressed
in the States . We gill not win this war with the tank alone, but we will not win
the war without the tank . The enemy uses his tanks with his infantry, and unless I
our infantry has tanks fighting alongside, they - are sure to be ruined by the enemy
tanks . I have seen two enemy tariffs practically annihilate a regiment of American
infantryy in ttr-ma nnutes . _have seen_ty_ oJm .iiidividual t ~ks ~nou dorm=: fro~atlra-
-h ndred to three hundred-of the enemy in a few minutes time . Our battle trained
infantry knows this, but the teamplay between the tanks and the infantry has been
sadly neglected . First of a'1, there must be coaununication between the tank platoons
and the infantry platoons and companies in order that the tank may be directed
to the enemy which is holding up the advance, or that the tank may be informed b;r
the infantry of antitank guns or tank traps which will delay or destroy the tank .
3
Prior to the breakout at the Anzio Beachhead, our G .H .Q. tank battaliot
were put under my command for training for the operation, with the result that for
the first time infantry and tanks acted together as a coordinated team which
resulted in a minimum of losses for the infantry end a mutual regard and admiration
between the infantry and the tanks such as had never existed before . There must be
developed a high degree of cooperation between the tanks, tank destroyers, and
artillery.
Throughout the African and Italian campaigns the German Panther and
Tiger tanks were superior in armament and gunpower to our tanks . It was, therefore
necessary to have tank destroyers right up front with the tanks with their heavier
three inch gun . This was the only gun outside of heavy artillery that could haaj .
the -Panther and Tiger tanks . Had our tanks_been equipped V th a more powerful
there would have been no need for tank destroyers . The tank destroyer simply Mi .
the gunpower that the tank lacked . Therefore, in the attack, the tank and the
tank destroyer must go together with the infantry following close behind to take
advantage of the ground gained .
r
In the defense, tanks and tank destroyers must be scattered over the
front so as to handle the hostile tanks as they attack our positions . Forward
observers from the artillery must ride with the for :.a.-rd line of tanks, and communication
must be set up so as to bring the mass of the artillery fire on objectives
with-speed and accuracy . In general, ordinary artillery fire is not a
great menace to the tank, for unless the tank is hit by heavy calibre artillery, ii ;
will not be seriously damaged . However, massed artillery fires on tanks has prcv :r_
to be successful as a great volume of fire usually results in setting some of the
hostile tanks on fire .
It should be b orne in mind that a small, well drilled, and coordi ::.- t- d
I= can be counted upon to accomplish more than a larger but less coordinated team
hat goes for battles as well as sports . Always take time to coordinate an
attack. Don't all owyourself to bQJturried.
. ..e for your orders to get
down to the lower units_._ _Get all__your men set. It will pay. postattacks that
fai:l_, fa11-""becausethey were not well set, and all the means at the disposal of
the commander were not put into action .
e. kcal:Fitness .
This point is well understood by the American Army and is one of our
best training points . However, we must prepare ourselves according to the job
that we are expected to do and according to our age . The spectacle of a division
commander running across country to get himself in shape is absurd as he will not
be required to withstand physical hardship that requires that kind of endurance .
he may very well injure himself by such exercise . A division commander must
gripaxe him_ sel_f to_go without sleep,, to withstand the -worry and responsibility of
battle, to be calm and fit .
- --
~~
On the other hand, the infantry soldier must be given long practice
arches with full pack, up hill and deign so that he can withstand the f0igue of
carrying a burden, so that he can withstand exposure in cold and wet weather without
getting sick, so that he can go several days without hot food .
4
The tanker must be able to stand the heat of his tank, the foul
atmosphere of his tank, the-jolting and body bruises .
The artilleryman must be' able to fire a1J day and all night with
little sleep and be strong enough to chuck the ammunition in . The ordinary
setting-up exercises are not sufficient . We must prepare our men with hard,
gruelling work.
2 . Speed on the Battlefield. i~_
All movement on the battlefield is relatively slow and deliberate . We
get a false picture of speed in maneuvers because we don't play supply accurately,
we don't have casualties, and we don't take the time for reconnaissance which is
required on the battlefield . In maneuvers we have been guilty of rewarding office .Â° :
and men for grandstand moves such as would be impossible to make on the battlefield
and which give a false impression of what can be accomplished . Speed can be
made by rapid decisions, by going rapidly from one reconnoitered place to another,
by thinking ahead and being prepared with the solution for emergency when it
arises, and, above all, by forethought as to how to handle the contingencies of
battle when they come up .
A division commander must always be thinking in terms of what is going .to
happen from six to twelve hours ahead of the present . Steady boring in all day
long is what wins the battle . Many tanks were lost in the early days under the
false training idea of boiling dQwn-the-road_inta contact there the _ enemy- a .titank
guns were sitting in a trap and picked our tanks off like ducks . Hundreds
of infantry neni eve-been sacrificed by throwing them into 4ri attack without
ecordinating fire :., without preparation, without reconnoitering the ground . The
irk -rk of a well trained and superior outfit is the delit,arate and assured way it
i;oes into battle, checking on every detail, seeing that everything is set, r dog
;. ^visions for what will probably happen in the immediate future . The nark of a
Loy Scout division is its great industry, its hurry and bluster and lack of
appreciation for and attention to intimate details that go to make up coordination
and assured effort .
An objective in battle is us-i7 fly won in the first fear hours after the
attack begins, or it is not going to i e won at all with the initial combination
Sa?, up. If the attack humps off at daylight and is begged don by ten o'clock in
the morning, the division commander must realize that a change in his plan must
be made . To put such a change into effect and thoroughly lossen up the battlefield
frill require at least six to eight hours, so the new assault can't take
lace much earlier than five or six o'clock in the evening . I have seen many
attempts to hurry this schedule with the result of failure in the neâ¢~r attempt. .
~ha ncnr change may involve"",a greater cone entrat :gin of artillery on a certain
the throwing in of greater force against a front heretofore weakly attacked,
e
If in doubt as to whether you can attack at a certain hour, it is al:,ays
cost to add another hour to insure a better understanding among the 1o .-:er units of
your plan . Always brief your commanders as far down the line and as thoroughly
as time will permit .
The American soldier is fundamentally intelligent and does a lot of
thinking for himself . If he understands the general plan and what you are trying
to do, he will very often contribute very greatly to the success of that plan .
He will surprise you when left to his own devices and in the absence of detailed
orders later in the course of battle . We are generally afraid that the private
grill kn.:)w too much, and if captured, will talk too much about the plan and thus
give it away . I believe this to be over emphasized . If I had time, I would tell
all privates practic ally everything about the plans and would get much better
results thereby .
One of the greatest contributing factors to the successful breai-_throu h
in the Anzio Beachhead was the great amount of detailed planning and the great
amount of briefing that was given to the noncccrsissioned officers and privates in
the tank and infantry units . Reaners'oer that ycu never know when the second, thiri,
and fourth stringers trill step into the shoes of the battalion, company, and platcc_,
commanders . If your attack is to continue smoothly and according to plan, these
men must know .,chat it is all. about, or your attack is bogged down for hours . Iconsider
this one of the most, important things to stress in training and on the
battlefield . I also feel that as a result of our school teachings it is one of
the most overlooked practical ideas .
Give time for briefing . Add plenty of safety factors on all logistics to
:.aye care of the imponderables such as heavy shelling, desttrucrtion of trucks and
bridges enroute, losing the way, etc . It is better to wait for the battle to
begin than to be late arriving in the attack positions .
3 . Coordination Cfmart,,Inrantryy and Arti3ler`,
The tank-infantry-artillery team is little unorstocd outside the armci .--zY'
c'i.-: ?_sions, and this lack of understanding is a distinct; failure of training ix? tt ^- .
It must be corrected at once .
The tank is designed to bear the brunt of battle, and its crew must be
trained to accept the dangers and be :Tilling to lead in the attack wherever the
ground permits . On the other hand, the infantry must not sit back on the hill and
watch the show. Failure of the tanks to take 'she lead and boar. the brunt of
.tle has brought disparaging rev- ~Ks upon th;r by the info--.~7i,rv . Fat lr_re of the
nantry to come up and take over tile ground taLan b;r the to ks has caused the
:a_ks to curse the infantry . Failure of the artillery to n_,ss its fires and help
pave the way by neutralizing tine antitank guns and smothering hostile artillery
has lost many a fight .
In a later paragraph I will discuss t-he d .f 'â¬'teen^.e between G .H.Q. ta''k
'talions and the tank battalion^ o E"" the- arm~a>e i divisions - a?id what - I consider to
_- a remedy to change a rather bad situation .
The following is a training directive issued in preparation for the
l,reakthrough at the Anzio Beachhead relative to infantry, tan ., and artillery
cooperation . All assault battalions of infantry and assault battalions of tar-cs
were trained along these lines, and the operation was very successful . It is
:-,I_eved the principles are sound and should be adopted as a basis for all
infantry and tank cooperation .
6
""There are two general types of action for tanks and infantry : one in
which, due to'the character of the terrain, obstacles or concentrations of antitank
guns in which the infantry makes tho principal attack closely supported by
tanks ; and the other in which, due to the favorable terrain for tanks and where the
enemy's principal defensive lines has been broken, tanks go through to exploit
the success and the action is characterized by the tanks making the main effort
-with the infantry in close support to assist then over obstacles encountered, to
take over the ground gained, and to outpost the tanks for the night . The tank
was developed for the primary purpose of taking the brunt of the battle from the
infantry, to go through areas protected by antipersonnel mines and wire, and small
arms . and machine gun fire .
rer_y weapon available to the enemyJs a-potential
I
killer of the infantry_y soldier; only a fear weapons are _deadly to the tank . The
principal enemies of the tank are unfavorable ground for maneuver, antitank mine :,
antitank guns and artillery . The armor of the tank furnishes reasonably good
protection against artillery fire unless artillery of large caliber makes direct
hits on the tank itself or very close to it, and even in these cases the tank
soldier rarely is injured although his tank mail, be temporarily put out of action .
The_ casualty -rate among tankers is relatively low averaging approximately l-, men per
tank crew, but of these casualties only a small proportion are fatal, a great
majority of the casualties being slight, and tie men are returned to duty in a -
relatively short period of time . The foregoing facts are borne out by statistics
kept over a long period of time and obtained from actual tank encounters . It is,
therefore, reasonable and right to expect the tanker to move boldly out to the
front lead the infantry, and take the brunt of the battle wherever the terrain
permits .
""Artillery observers asst be up fo .7oard with the tok.s and with the
ad~Tanced lines of the infantry to promptly and accurately bring fire on enemy
allations holding up the advance . To much cannot ba stressed on the impox~a-~e :.
the coordination between the artillery, tank and infantrymen . Upon the skkiil
the artillery and the concentrations of its fires depends the success of the
ance, particularly of the tank when held up temporarily by antitank fire .
""Tankers should move forward by bounds covering each other by fire from
tanks in hull down positions in the rear . The advance of tanks may be rapid in.
spots and slow at other times as the tankers must study the ground carefi ,Ly frc-is
one point of advance to another . They must move rapidly from the rear position
to -the selected position fogt-card . Above all, they should have the attitude and
spirit to lead the attack, to continue the advance whether slow or rapid, and
continually bore in to arrive at the final objectives . No other thought should be
in their minds, otherwise they are not good tankers and the expenditure of money
and effort for the manufacture of tanks is wasted .
I.'The.coordination and communication= between the infantry and tanks are
paramount . There must be established radio means of communication so that the
infantry company commander can direct the the tank on to the hostile dispositions
which are holding them up and giving, them casu alties.
7
""Normally in an attack in which the infantry has the main tasks and is
closely supported by tanks, the tanks should be attached directly to the infantry
battalions . In the case where the tanks make the main effort the infantry is
attached to the task commander or moves under orders of the task force . In the
preparation for an attack the tank commander will advise the infantry commander
after careful study of the ground, maps and airplane photographs of the best
manner in which to employ the tanks . The infantry co=mander should accept this
advice and build his attack around the tank wherever possible . Communications
must be thoroughly worked out . This requires in the most cases- special radio
equipment able to coi uituhicate with the tanks to be in the hands of the infantry .
""Special provisions must be made prior to the attack for assisting the
tanks over wadis and other obstacles . This must not be left to chance . If there
are sufficient engineers available, a detachment of engineers may be set up for
this purpose ; if not available, then a part of the pioneer section of the infantry
reconnaissance platoons, or sections of the reconnaissance companies of the armored
regiments, might be used . If neither of the foregoin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THE GERMAN ARMORED DIVISION
1 . The armored division is intended for strategic roles . It
combines great fire power with high mobility, and its armor and
speed restrict the effectiveness of enemy weapons .
2 . Its strength lies in attack . It is especially suited for surprise
appearances on the battlefield, rapid concentration of considerable
fighting power, obtaining quick decisions by break-throughs, deep
penetrations on wide fronts, and the destruction of the enemy .
The attack of the armored division has a serious effect on the
enemy's morale.
3. The nature of the terrain is a decisive factor for successful
employment of the armored division . Full use of its speed can be
insured by choice of good roads with bridges of adequate capacity,
and by their being kept clear of other troops . Speed across
country depends upon weather, formation of the ground, nature
of the soil, and density of vegetation . It is slower than on roads .
The full striking power of the armored division can best be developed
in attack over rolling country with few features . Marshy,
wooded, and rough country allows movement off the road only for
short stretches, with reduced mobility. It may exclude the
employment of tanks .
4. The components of an armored division are so proportioned
that the detachment of individual units, especially of tanks, or
their attachment to other units, restricts the fitness of the division
for employment in strategic roles .
5 . The main striking force of the division lies in its tank brigade .
Its offensive infantry element is the motorized infantry brigade .
In addition the armored division comprises motorized reconnaissance
elements, motorized artillery, antitank units, armored
signal units, antiaircraft machine-gun troops, and supply and
maintenance services . In active campaigns an observation squadron
(serves also for artillery observation) and a light antiaircraft
battalion are attached to the division .

ROLE OF THE ARMORED DIVISION
6 . The armored division normally fights in the framework of
the armored corps, but is also suited to carry out independent
operations, in which case reinforcement with motorized infantry
and artillery is usually necessary .
7. Its supreme role is to obtain decision in battle . Within the
framework of the armored corps it can carry out the following
tasks :
a . Break through an enemy protective screen to make early
contact with the enemy's main force ;
b. Obtain early possession of topographical features and sectors
of decisive importance for further fighting ;
c. Gain surprise in an attack on the advancing enemy to frustrate
his plans and take the initiative from him ;
d. Attack an enemy incompletely prepared for defense ;
e. Attack on a narrow front against a prepared enemy ;
f. Restore momentum to an attack which has come to a standstill;
g . Break through on a wide front against a demoralized enemy ;
h. Exploit success and complete the destruction of the enemy
by deep penetration or flank attack ;
i. Pursue a defeated enemy ;
j. arry out strategic envelopment ;
k. Attack to destroy enemy tank units ;
1. ooperate with parachute and air-borne troops .
8. The armored division acting independently can carry out
the following strategic tasks :
a. Reconnaissance in force in cooperation with strategic aerial
reconnaissance ;
b. Early occupation of sectors important for further operations,
of politically and economically important localities, and of industrial
installations ;
2
c. Delaying the enemy advance, providing a protective screen,
or acting as a flank guard to a larger unit,
9. The armored division is equally suitable for breaking through
a prepared position when the position is strengthened by isolated
permanent fortifications . The cooperation of medium artillery
and bombardment aviation then becomes necessary .
In an attack on a prepared position, the speed and mobility of
an armored division cannot be exploited . There is a danger that
tanks may he exposed to such heavy casualties against a prepared
defense that the further employment of the division becomes impossible.
Armored divisions are therefore only to be used for breaking
through a permanent front if infantry divisions are not available,
if the delay in bringing them forward may result in losing an
opportunity to exploit the success with armored divisions well
forward, or if the enemy is already demoralized . The armored
division must then be reinforced by motorized infantry, artillery,
and motorized engineers, weapons capable of assaulting concrete
works, and smoke troops . They must also be supported by
bombardment aviation.
10 . The armored division can attack across a river . The necessary
amount of reinforcement by other arms, especially engineers,
depends on the strength of the enemy and his defense, and on the
width of the river .
11 . The role of the armored division in a protective task is
generally offensive . It carries out counterattacks to relieve parts
of the front under heavy pressure, breaks up enemy tank attacks
by surprise thrusts, is employed against the flanks of an enemy
who has broken through, or attacks the enemy from the flanks or
rear while he is held frontally .
If the armored division has to take part in a defensive operation,
which will be exceptional, every effort must be made to relieve it
as quickly as possible by infantry units .
12 . The armored division can also be used independently to
screen the withdrawal of large units . This task is usually carried
out offensively .
3
hapter 3
EMPLOYMENT OF THE ARMORED DIVISION
13 . The speed and mobility of the armored division demand
of all commanders boldness, powers of rapid decision, and ability
to convert decisions into brief commands .
14. The strength of the armored division lies in concentrating
the force of the tank brigade. This is the normal practice . It
is the task of the commander to see that all arms of the division
are used to support the tank attack . Individual arms must be
mutually supporting, and each must be prepared to exploit the
success of the other .
15. Task forces can be formed temporarily for specific missions :
a . In the attack, when the division is advancing on a broad
front over several roads against a weaker enemy, or in traversing
wooded or mountainous country ;
b . In a rapid pursuit when the division has to anticipate the
enemy in occupying important points, road junctions, potential
bottlenecks, etc. ;
c. In a withdrawal, to cover disengagement from the enemy .
Task forces are employed in accordance with the same principles
that apply to the armored division as a whole . The division
commander can influence the battle by employing reserves of all
arms. Task forces, however, must be provided at the outset
with all means necessary for the task allotted . The division
commander must make every effort to reconcentrate all parts of
the division under his direct command .
16. The object of the armored division in battle is'destruction
of the enemy, either by break-through or envelopment . The
mobility of the armored division enables it to avoid a frontal
engagement and to maneuver to the enemy's rear .
Foresight in choice of the terrain over which an anticipated
engagement is to take place is of great importance . This terrain
should be thoroughly covered by air reconnaissance . The art of
4
command lies in ability to choose the exact moment for deployment
for battle so that the object may be achieved wwith maximum
speed and minimum losses .
The armored division must be deployed in depth . When deep
penetration is made, long flanks are frequently exposed . Anxiety
on this cause must not, however, be allowed to hamper bold
action nor divert the division from the decisive direction . Advance
measures must be taken to screen the flanks and defend against
air attack.
17. In battle the full striking force of the division must be
used unsparingly . The more decisive the role of the division in
the operation, the more important this becomes . The greater the
forces that can be concentrated at one point, the greater will be
the success and the smaller the losses .
18. The tank's ability to surprise by its speed and mobility
must be fully exploited . Aids to this are the screening of movements,
camouflage of bivouacs, and prevention of enemy air
reconnaissance .
19. Accurate knowledge of the topography must be obtained
by detailed study of maps and aerial photographs before orders
are issued .
Subordinate commanders must be kept constantly informed
of the current situation and the division commander's ultimate
intention, in order to be able to adjust themselves to rapid changes
in the situation which are often encountered as a result of the
speed of movement, and in order to act in accord with the commander's
general plan when unexpected difficulties and obstacles
are encountered .
The cooperation of all parts of the division must be worked
out in the greatest detail possible by the division commander.
In order to avoid' delays, frequent use will be made in the armored
division of short warning orders . A thrust line (see note) will
be given to the division during the attack in order that fresh
directions of attack and objectives may be radioed in the clear .
Important information gained by reconnaissance can also be communicated
quickly and safely by this means .
Note . The thrust line (Stosslinie) method is much used by the Germans
for sending map references in the clear . It consists of a line drawn upon a
5
The situation and necessity for rapid action may compel the
division commander to intervene temporarily in the command of
lower units by setting new objectives for the tanks or the motorized
infantry regiments .
20. ommanders of all units must establish themselves with
an advance headquarters well forward, and must be in a position
to survey the battlefield frequently in time to issue their orders
map which theoretically may run in any direction but actually usually
extends in the proposed direction of advance or down the axis of a reconnaissance
unit .
6
Tl'e line, which begins at a fixed point and continues indefinitely in the
required direction, is usually divided into centimeters for convenience . To
give a map reference a perpendicular is dropped from the reference point to
the thrust line . Measurements are then taken from the point of origin to
the point where the perpendicular cuts the thrust line, then along the perpendicular
to the reference point . Since the point may lie on either side of
the thrust line, the second figure must be prefaced by either "" right"" or 'left""
or as one looks toward the enemy .
A typical reference would be ""6 right 3 ."" The figures are always in centimeters
; therefore the actual distance on the ground will vary with the scale
of the map used . The scale may start with an arbitrary figure, have dummy
figures interspersed, or start with the number of the thrust line when there are
several in a given area . These devices make the code difficult to break
rapidly .
Instruments have been found consisting of a transparent ruler graduated
in millimeters, with a shorter ruler similarly graduated fixed to slide up and
down at right angles to the long ruler . Operators with practice can give
references very quickly .
early and note changes in the situation,' This applies especially
to the division commander .' On the move he will usually have
his headquarters with the commander of the advance guard . In
action he will choose a position from which he can most quickly
and directly influence the conduct of the battle .
A tactical headquarters group will remain as long as possible
with the division commander . Terrain, enemy activity, liaison
with superior headquarters, and necessity for insuring unified
command may, however, lead to separation . Even so, the
tactical group must make every effort to be well forward . The
division commander communicates with his tactical group by radio
or messenger . He must keep constantly in touch with his tactical
group in order to keep abreast of the situation as a whole .
It may be desirable to specify in division orders the route to be
followed by the tactical group and the proposed location of the
command post. Higher headquarters and units protecting flanks
must have early notice of these points .
It must be made clear in orders which units are to establish
message-dropping grounds .
21 . Signal communications must be established early so that
information and orders may be transmitted quickly to meet
changes in the situation . As the radio method of communication
employed by the armored division betrays the latter's presence to
the enemy, radio silence must be maintained, especially by tank
units, until the moment operations commence . Orders must
therefore be communicated as long as possible by means of
messengers, telephones, and, over long distances, by aircraft .
See par . 140, FM 100-5, FSR .
s In this connection, note the following excerpt from ""Panzers across the
Meuse,"" in The Field Artillery journal (April 1941) ;
""Of interest is General Guderian's method of exercising command in the
field . His headquarters is divided into two echelons . The rear one (headed
by the hief of Staff) contains the larger part of the staff, and remains in
fairly quiet places to study situation maps, work on orders, and to act as a
clearing house for the flow of information to and from the front . The
forward echelon of headquarters is led by the general himself (he is the 'outside'
man) in a small cross-country car . Apparently Guderian sits in the
front seat of this vehicle, which he frequently drives himself . With him are
two staff' officers and an adjutant . Following are two aides in motorcycles
with side cars ; then two or three messengers on solo motorcycles ; and finally
the armored wireless truck, or P-an open armored vehicle equipped with
radios, map tables, etc . Guderian used this car throughout the Polish carnpaign.
With this small circus he spends his time up at the very front,
circulating back and forth between his subordinate units .""
7
After battle begins, orders are issued chiefly,by radio . It is
essential to proper functioning of the armored division that radio
communication should function perfectly, since it controls not
only communications within the division, but also between the
division and neighboring formations, and between air and ground
reconnaissance forces .
Radio must be safeguarded . All messages regarding future
intentions which allow the enemy sufficient time to take countermeasures
must be camouflaged in accordance with regulations .
Messages and orders which call for immediate action are sufficiently
camouflaged by use of the thrust line and code names .
22. If there is likelihood of cooperation of fighter and bombardment
aviation with the armored division, contact must be made
beforehand with commanders of the units involved, and details
thoroughly worked out .
An air liaison officer must be allotted to headquarters of an
armored division. He must have an air signal section to maintain
constant touch with flying units. Timing and targets must be
worked out in advance in cooperation with dive-bomber and
bomber units . ommanders of air units must have early information
of the movement of the armored division . Targets must
be clearly laid down in order of priority .
Those elements of the division which are to receive aerial support
in the attack must know the objectives to be attacked and
the time, number, and duration of attacks to be made .

"appened if
WALLSTREET had been carried out, it was surely worth trying given the
exhausting character of the Rhineland battle. A plan to seize and defend a
bridgehead at Arnhem in February 1945, with full artillery and air support and a
secure line of communications, had a much better likelihood of success than the
ill-fated airborne venture of the previous September, and would almost certainly
have been less costly than frontal assaults against prepared defences in the
Rhineland.
The rejection of WALLSTREET meant that the Canadians were required
153
The Rhineland Battles and the Liberation of the Netherlands
to take over a front of some 2000 metres on the Rhine flank of the advance. The
area was currently occupied by a brigade of 15th Scottish Division, which had
been locked in combat with elements of 116th Panzer Division for three days. The
Scottish troops were in no condition to continue offensive action after a struggle
described as their worst experience since landing in Normandy,21 but the corps
plan required them to advance towards Kalkar, securing Moyland Wood before
handing over to the Canadians. This task proved well beyond their capacity and
when 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade arrived almost half of the woods and the
village were still in German hands. The next morning, 16 February, 7th Brigade,
supported by squadrons of the Scots Guards, took over the task.
The battle for Moyland Woods turned into a prolonged, costly action.
Total casualties to 7th Brigade including battle exhaustion exceeded 500 men and
the brigade had to be pulled out of action. Simonds, who was focused on the
advance towards Hochwald, was harshly critical of 7th Brigade and ordered
Major-General Dan Spry to relieve the brigade commander. Simonds was also
determined to replace Spry and did so when the Rhineland battle ended.
The battles for Moyland Wood, the Goch-Kalkar road, and the bitter
struggle for the town of Goch cost British and Canadian divisions more than 3,000
casualties, including 919 killed, wounded or missing on 20 February alone.
Canadian losses comprised just over 900 men, including 51 killed, 99 wounded
and 54 taken prisoner from the Essex Scottish.22 When combined with wastage
due to sickness and battle exhaustion, the casualty rate in VERITABLE was
hollowing out the combat power of many battalions. The Canadians could draw
upon a replacement pool greatly expanded by the arrival on the continent of
reinforcement drafts that included conscripts, but the British were desperately
short of trained men.
General Bill Simpsons 9th U.S. Army had waited impatiently while the
battle of the Rhineland was waged by British and Canadian troops. With ten
divisions, three of them armoured, 9th Army had over 300,000 men under
command plus its own tactical air force. Intelligence reports indicated that after
Panzer Lehr was committed to stemming VERITABLE there were fewer than
30,000 German troops of varying quality between the Americans and the Rhine.
Simpson and his corps commanders were understandably anxious to set such a
promising operation underway.23 When U.S. Army engineers calculated that the
reservoirs behind the blown dams would be empty by 24 February, Simpson
decided to start his attack early on 23 February while the river was still in flood,
in the hope of catching the defenders off guard.
Before launching GRENADE, General Simpson gave his Corps
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
154
commanders an instruction that was reminiscent of orders issued by General
Patton. Simpson wrote: If the violence of our attack should cause disruption of
the enemy resistance, each corps will be prepared to conduct relentless pursuit in
zone, and phases will be abandoned in favour of taking advantage of our
opportunity. By the evening of the second day tank and tank destroyer battalions
were across, and Simpson began to sense that things were breaking up. There
was not much in front of Ninth Army, and it was time to go for the Rhine. The
German commander, von Zangen, had received reinforcementsthe 9th and 11th
Panzer Divisions, plus the 338th Infantry Divisionbut as usual they had to be
hastily fed into the defensive perimeter in the hope of maintaining a cohesive line.
Counter-thrusts then bled their hitting power and the best the Germans could do
was to slow down the American advance.24 The hammer was well and truly aimed
for the anvil of the British-Canadian forces to the north. But the anvil, as we shall
see, was not allowed to remain in place until the American hammer had delivered
the crushing blow. Instead, frontal attacks on the main German defensive position
were ordered, and 2nd Canadian Corps found itself fighting one of its most costly
operations of the war.
The decision to pause and mount a new offensive operation to the
Hochwald Forest and Xanten was made by Montgomery on 20 February, three
days before GRENADE began. The eleven German divisions committed to
containing the Anglo-Canadian advance were sowing the seeds for a successful
Grenade and Montgomery was determined to maintain pressure and reach the
objectives set out in his original orders. Simonds 2nd Canadian Corps, which
Montgomery claimed had lost just 400 of the 3,800 casualties suffered in
VERITABLE, was to have primary responsibility for the new offensive on the
main enemy positions while 30th Corps operates from Goch towards Weeze and
thence southward. His nightly message to London noted that he was going
forward tomorrow to spend two days at TAC HQ Canadian Army to examine the
battle in detail.25
General Crerar outlined Montgomerys plan to his corps commanders on
21 February. Crerar told 30th Corps to renew its advance the next day capturing
the town of Weeze and, if the opportunity arose, exploiting towards Kevelaer.
Four British divisions plus 1st Commando Brigade were to take part in the
advance. Second Canadian Corps, with two British divisions under command,
was to begin a new offensive on 26 February breaking through the Hochwald
defences and exploiting to Xanten.26 The next day, Simonds outlined his corps
plan, using the name BLOCKBUSTER for the Canadian attack. (The appreciation
and outline plan is reproduced below.)
The next day, when news of the success of the American attack had
155
The Rhineland Battles and the Liberation of the Netherlands
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
156
reached Crerars headquarters, the Army Commander began to reconsider
BLOCKBUSTER. As the Army intelligence summary put it, There is no doubt
that the 9th U.S. Armys operations will have an effect on the First Canadian Army
front. What form it will take remains to be seen. Twenty-four hours later, further
news of a rapid American advance, strong resistance to the 30th Corpss attack on
Weeze and evidence of an increase in activity and gun strength in the
Hochwald27 prompted Crerar to issue new orders:
In view of the determined enemy resistance 24/25 Feb, north of
Weeze and the consequent inability of 53 (Welsh) Division to
firmly secure that town before Operation Blockbuster commences
it will be necessary to reconsider the basic draft plan. If by D + 1
it is obvious that to complete Blockbuster a considerable
regrouping is required, then a partial Blockbuster will terminate
the operation.
Crerar noted that he was prepared to be satisfied with securing this highground
east of the Kalkar-Üedem road.28
The first day of BLOCKBUSTER was extraordinarily successful. The
2nd Division captured the northern half of the Kalkar Ridge and dealt effectively
with German counterattacks. The 3rd Division penetrated the enemys outer
defences securing both Kepplen and Üedem while 4th Armoured Division reached
its first phase objectives in preparation for an advance through the Hochwald Gap.
Simonds was very happy and pleased with the performance of the divs in the
corps today  everything fine considering the rotten tank-going caused by the rain
last night.29
Montgomery and Crerar were also impressed with the corps
achievements. Montgomerys nightly message was especially optimistic,
reporting that he was very well satisfied and hoped to write off or capture the
bulk of the Germans west of the Rhine. He noted, this converging operation
with two large armies is a tricky business and I have to keep a pretty tight grip on
the battle to ensure it goes the way required. Montgomery hoped that the better
weather promised for the next few days would allow the air forces to destroy the
Wesel bridges and prevent the withdrawal of the enemys heavy equipment. The
prospect of maximum activity of air forces on the Rhine by day and night added
to his confidence that BLOCKBUSTER and GRENADE would quickly end
German resistance.30
On the night of 26/27 February, Simonds issued orders for the next stage
of BLOCKBUSTER. Despite the difficulties reported by 11th Armoured Division
south of Üedem, where boggy ground and numerous enemy anti-tank guns had
The Rhineland Battles and the Liberation of the Netherlands
157
produced a slow, miserable, costly operation, the advance to Sonsbeck was to
continue with the divisions infantry brigade in the lead.31 Simonds issued similar
orders to 4th Canadian Armoured Division who were to send Lion Group,
composed of the Algonquin Regiment and the tanks of the South Albertas, forward
to the at the western end of the Hochwald Gap. They were to proceed under
cover of darkness because there was no protection from the high ground and so
that the crest of the hill could be reached before daylight.32
At 1600 hours, 27 February, Simonds joined Crerar, Horrocks and Air
Vice-Marshal Hudleston, for the Army Commanders daily conference. While it is
unlikely that they knew the details of 9th Armys appreciation, that German
resistance on the Roer front was on the verge of collapse, they were aware that the
American bridgehead was secure, with elements of two armoured divisions across
the river. Again we have no record of their discussions, just of their decision to
mount what proved to be a costly and unsuccessful attempt to break through the
enemy defences.
The situation was very different on 9th Armys front, where, on the
afternoon of 1 March, the Americans were less than five kilometres from the
Rhine opposite Düsseldorf and within striking distance of the boundary between
the two Allied armies. The weakness of the enemy and the elaborate road network
of the Cologne plain invited the bold use of armour, and General Simpson decided
to send strong armoured punches towards the Rhine bridges.33
Montgomery visited General Simpson on 28 February seeing the corps
commanders and many of the divisional generals. Ninth Army, he reported, has
gained a great victory with very few casualties and this has raised morale to a high
level. The next day, Montgomery commented on the sensational results in the
south and the very hard and bitter fighting34 in the north, but proposed no
changes in existing plans to require most of Simpsons 9th Army to cease
operations once they reached the Rhine. Eisenhower encouraged Simpson to try
and secure an intact bridge across the Rhine, but when Simpson met with
Montgomery to request permission to operate as far north as the bridges at Wesel,
well within the Canadian zone, Montgomery, who must have remembered a
similar debate over boundaries at Falaise in Normandy, agreed to extend 9th
Armys sphere of action to Rhineberg, 10 kilometres south of Wesel, but he
reserved the task of reducing the Wesel bridgehead to First Canadian Army.35
This decision left Crerar with few choices. The enemy was known to be
busy building a new defensive line around Wesel, but there was no sign of an
immediate withdrawal in the Hochwald. Crerar proposed to shift the weight of
30th Corps attack farther to the south before turning it east to the Rhine leaving

the Sonsbeck-Veen road to the Canadians. Before dawn on 2 March, elements of
all three Canadian divisions were plunged into a series of fierce and bloody battles
that taxed the capacity of everyone involved.
We have no record of Simonds views or new orders which required
2nd and 30th corps to press attacks on a well-defended bridgehead, but on
7 March he did agree to a request from Major-General Bruce Matthews for a
24 hour pause to organize a set-piece attack on Xanten. Simonds told 43rd British
Division, which had been conforming to 2nd Divisions advance on the Rhine
flank to commit a brigade to this action which was carried out with full artillery
support, a smoke screen and elaborate counter-battery and counter-mortar
arrangements. By late afternoon on 8 March British and Canadian troops had
made contact in the centre of Xanten. No such careful preparation marked the
advance of 4th Division towards Veen.
Montgomerys reluctance to employ the full weight of 9th Army against
the Wesel Pocket imposed an enormous burden on the British and Canadian
troops, who suffered 1503 casualties in the last six days of the Rhineland battle,
including over 500 killed and missing.
The Canadians were pinched out of the last days of the Rhineland battle,
which Crerar co-ordinated with 30th British and 16th U.S. Corps. The defeat
suffered by the German Army in the Rhineland, coupled with the enormous losses
on the Eastern Front, made the continued defence of Germany impractical. In the
west, the Allies had taken their millionth prisoner, and victory was now a matter
of time and endurance. General Crerar summed up the experiences of the
Canadian Army in his quarterly dispatch to Ottawa:
During the concluding stages our own infantry suffered heavy
casualties from shelling, mortaring and rockets. This was
consistent with the enemys tactics throughout the whole of the
operation. His firepower, particularly from machine-guns,
mortars and cannon had been more heavily and effectively
applied than at any other time in the Armys fighting during the
present campaign. Not including self-propelled guns, I estimate
that at the beginning of March over 700 mortars and more than
1,000 guns of various calibers were available to the First
Parachute Army. Only rarely did there appear to be any shortage
of ammunition, and on a narrow front, the enemy gunners were
able to concentrate their fire on our points of penetration in the
natural defiles along the line of advance. The combined effects of
guns and tough going made themselves felt in the loss to us of
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
160
some 300 tanks.
Our material superiority was not without its effect, but the state of
the ground and the prevailing wet and overcast weather prevented
the full deployment and exploitation of our strength.36
Simonds was more concerned with what he saw as a decline in the
standard of infantry tactics during the Rhineland battles and other problems that
he believed had to be corrected for future operations. Major Sesia, the corps
historical officer, took notes at the Corps Commander Conference held on
17 March 1945. (This document is reproduced below.)
The 2nd Canadian Corps was not involved in the planning of the Rhine
crossing, and its future role could only be described in general terms. Once the
British and American armies were across the Rhine and racing into the heart of
Germany, 2nd Canadian Corps was to open a supply route to the north through
Arnhem and clear Northeast Holland and the coastal belt eastwards towards the
Elbe. The 1st Canadian Corps, recently arrived from Italy, was to liberate the
old provinces of Holland to the west. The 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade was
attached to 51st Highland Division for the crossing and all of 3rd Canadian
Division was committed to the battle for Emmerich, which lasted until 30 March.
Once the 2nd and 4th divisions joined 3rd Division on the east bank of the
Rhine, 2nd Canadian Corps began to advance on three distinct centre lines. The
4th Armoured Division was required to protect the left flank of the British advance
while 3rd Division cleared the east side of the Ijssel River, including the cities of
Zutphen and Deventer. The 2nd Division moved north to Groningen, where it
fought an intense battle for the city. There was little a corps commander could
contribute to these operations and Simonds was frustrated by the fragmented role
assigned to the corps.
The battle for Groningen was in its third day when Montgomery arrived
at Crerars headquarters with new instructions. Eisenhowers directive of 15 April
required 2nd British Army to seize crossings over the Elbe, secure Hamburg and
advance to Lübeck and the Baltic in preparation for the liberation of Denmark.
Operations to clear northeast Holland and the coastal belt into Germany were also
ordered, and Eisenhower assumed this meant the capture of Bremen, scheduled to
be the American port of entry into occupied Germany.37 Bremen was strongly
defended, and General Horrocks wanted additional troops, an attack by Bomber
Command and time to build up stocks of ammunition.38 Montgomery sought a
Canadian infantry division to join 4th Canadian Armoured Division on the British
flank. Crerar agreed, and both men flew to Simonds headquarters to work out the
details. Crerar also announced that he was needed in London and would authorize
161
The Rhineland Battles and the Liberation of the Netherlands
Simonds to act for him as army commander while he was away.39
Simonds met with his divisional commanders to outline their new tasks on
20 April. The 4th Division had become embroiled in a costly battle at the Küsten
Canal, held by the enemy as a defensive line blocking access to Wilhelmshaven.
Simonds told Vokes to build-up the bridgehead before striking east to Oldenburg.
If the city was too strong for an armoured division to capture, the division was
to seal off the northern exits and advance to the Weser River. The Polish
Armoured was to advance towards Varel and Wilhelmshaven.40 Simonds did not
yet know what role 2nd Division might play, and Matthews was simply told to
deploy his division on the left flank of 30th Corps. The most important new task
was assigned to 3rd Division, which was to prepare for an infantry brigade
assault across the River Leda into Leer and advance via Aurich into Emden.
Hoffmeisters 5th Armoured Division was to relieve 3rd Division in northeast
Holland and be prepared to seize the Dutch port of Delfzijl after Emden was
captured.41
Before examining the battles for Delfzijl and Emden, we need to
understand the broad strategic picture in mid-April 1945. The United States
9th Army reached the Elbe on 11 April and secured a bridgehead across the river
the next day. General Simpson was confident his troops could reach Berlin
quickly, just 70 miles away, but Eisenhower was adamant, no lives were to be lost
in pursuit of an objective that would have to be handed over to the Soviets.42 A
rapid advance to Berlin in April 1945 was well within the capacity of the Allied
armies and, as Winston Churchill argued, As long as Berlin holds out German
resistance will be stimulated.43 Churchill was surely right when he argued that if
the Allies had concentrated their forces Berlin could have been reached quickly
and the Germans forced to surrender. He believed the war was prolonged for two
or three costly weeks because of this decision, but no American was any longer
responsive to Churchills views.
That night President Franklin D. Roosevelt died, plunging America and
the western world into heartfelt mourning. Newspapers and radio stations
focused on stories about Roosevelt, his successor Harry Truman, the shocking
evidence of Nazi death campsespecially Bergen-Belsenand speculation about
an immediate collapse of German resistance. The war, it appeared, was all but
over. On 16 April the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Force
suspended the strategic air offensive and prepared to use their heavy bombers to
bring relief supplies to Holland. In Berlin, Hitler, confined to his underground
bunker, celebrated his last birthday on 20 April and two days later announced his
determination to stay despite the advance of Soviet troops who had all but
surrounded the city.
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
162
The last major battles fought by the Canadians in Northwest Europe were
carried out in accordance with the strategy of maintaining pressure and securing
the North Sea ports. The heaviest burden fell as always on the infantry, required
to close with the enemy through to the last day of the war. Simonds was reluctant
to issue the final orders for operations that would cost more Canadian lives. His
hesitation was based on two important considerations: the overall military
situation now pointing to an imminent German surrender, and the limited
resources available for what looked like major battles. There was a birthday
dinner for Simonds on 23 April, but the mood was sombre. Bomber Command,
which played a major role in the attack on Bremen, was not available for Leer or
Emden. Simonds and his staff were even more upset with the un-cooperative
attitude of Air Marshal Coningham, who insisted that the flak defences of the
Emden fortress area prohibited the use of medium bombers, and limited the
employment of Typhoons to direct support of the river crossing.44 They were also
surprised to learn that the Buffalo LVTs were needed at the Elbe and the
Canadians would have to rely on storm boats.45
On the morning of 27 April Montgomery reiterated his orders and added
the capture of the Frisian Islands to Simonds list of responsibilities. When a
request for commando brigades to assist in these projected assault landings was
refused, the low priority attached to Canadian operations was evident to all.46 The
Corps Commanders War Diary entry for 27 April reflects the attitudes expressed
at corps and army headquarters:
27 April. Comd had a conference at 1115 hrs with Comds
3 Canadian, 5 Cdn Armoured and 1 Pol Armoured Divs to
confirm arrangements for the assault into Leer. It was to carry on
irrespective of air sp which by reason of weather and other factors
not apparent to this HQ is not likely to extend beyond fighterbomber
attacks.47
Major-General R.H. Keefler, who now commanded 3rd Division, selected
9th Brigade to carry out Operation DUCK, the assault river crossing into Leer.
Brigadier John Rockingham was given enough storm boats to lift six companies
and he planned simultaneous attacks on the city from three directions. Leer was
seized and the other brigades crossed the river to join in the advance to Emden.
While 3rd Division fought the battle for Leer, Major-General Bert
Hoffmeister and his infantry brigade commander Ian Johnston decided to reinterpret
the orders given to 5th Armoured Division. Rather than wait until the
capture of Emden before securing the Dutch port of Delfzijl, Brigadier Johnstons
battalions began to compress the Delfzijl perimeter in preparation for the capture
163

of a series of fortified gun positions along the Ems Estuary. On 28 April
Hoffmeister told Simonds that he proposed to go ahead with an attack on Delfzijl,
code named Operation CANADA, because three or four days mucking about will
cost us more in the end.48 Simonds allowed Hoffmeister to use his own
judgement.
Hoffmeisters three infantry battalions were positioned to advance from
two directions: the Perths and Cape Breton Highlanders from the north, and the
Irish Regiment from the southeast. The motor battalion, the Westminsters, were
dismounted and sent forward to capture the gun batteries south of the town. In this
flat country with little cover and a complicated system of ditches and canals
cross-country movement was almost impossible, at least in daylight, so Johnston
ordered his men to move only at night in carefully controlled bounds. Everyone
was to be dug in and under cover at first light.49 This agonizing process continued
through to 2 May when the last defenders of Delfzijl and its gun batteries
surrendered. Casualties, including 75 men killed-in-action,50 were far higher than
expected, but 11th Brigades success was welcome news to the men of
3rd Division, who were attempting to capture Aurich and Emden. Farther to the
east, the soldiers of the Polish Armoured Division, 4th Canadian Armoured
Division, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division and 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade
were engaged in a series of limited actions to clear the Wilhelmshaven peninsula.
The final days of the war were a tense period for everyone, from Simonds
and his staff officers, who were denied the support they believed the troops
needed, to the men at the sharp end asked to maintain pressure without taking too
many chances. Total casualties in the last two weeks of the war included 490 men
killed-in-action, losses that seemed especially tragic in the circumstances. The
ruined cities, ravaged countryside and forlorn refugees added to the misery, and
when the news of the ceasefire reached the forward troops on 5 May, there were
few celebrations, just an overwhelming sense of relief that the war was finally
over.

5 Methods of operation --a Offensive operations
of armored units acting either alone or as part of a
combined force are characterized by rapid thrusts into
vital parts of the hostile rear followed by immediate
exploitation to complete energy demoralization Armored
division commanders coordinate and control the movement
of subordinate units by appropriate assignment of
routes zones objectives or phase lines Phase lines
are prescribed only when required to insure coordinated
action or movement of two or more units and must not
involve prolonged halts thereon The attack is massed
initially but is extended promptly in frontage and
depth by the armored reconnaissance and combat elements
after the hostile position is penetrated As the operation
gains momentum reconnaissance agencies should
precede combat elements at the earliest opportunity to
seek out and develop soft spots through which combat
elements may pass rapidly The more time allowed for
this reconnaissance the more effective it will be
Contact once gained must be maintained
b PSaximum advantage is taken of speed and terrain
barriers to prevent or neutralize enemy countermeasures
Reconnaissance agencies provide information on which to
base security measures Other combat detachments provide
immediate advance flank and rear security
Closely supporting motorized units protect the immediate
rear and lines of communication of the armored elements
Other motorized units should relieve the armored
unit commanders of concern for extended lines of communication
and assure continuous logistical support'
When armored units are operating as task forces the
security of the immediate supporting motorized elements
will be c !ha iced by t?heix fotlowiuug the armored combat
elements as closely as possible
c Following the advance of armored units other
elements of task- forces (see par 4) operate to overcome
remaining hostile resistance occupy ground gained
keep gaps open extend and protect the flanks and relieve
armored units temporarily checked in order to permit
their employment in a more remunerative direction
Whenever practicable other less mobile troops should
follow motorized task units as closely as possible to
wipe out the last vestige of resistance meet counterattacks
and relieve the more mobile elements for close
support of the armored units
d ' In addition to establishing and maintaining local
control of the air supporting combat aviation is

6 Exploitation and ou_rLarge armored
formations operating separately or as part of task
forces are especially suited for exploitation and pursuit
They should be launched boldly against vital
areas deep in the hostile rear The exploitation and

shaken or beaten enemy Objectives-for armored units
should be those which will halt hostile rearward lovem_
ent until less mobile friendly troops can close with
the enemy Concurrently some armored elements_operate
to destroy disrupt and paralyze enemy c0imii unication__
and supply
V
b Pursuit by large armored units operating alone
or as major elements of task forces is rapid and continuous
even during hours of darkness
c When the operations of armored units are likely
to carry them beyond practicable operating radius of
organic supply means special- provision must be made by the
higher commanders to place necessary supplies within operating
radius of the units - Likewise special arrangements
must be made by higher headauartors for rapid communication
with the widely dispersed elements of armored
formations
7 - Defensive situations --Large armored units as--
part'of other major forces on the defensive are held
in readiness for the counteroffensive or majorc;
ounter-attack The eiaployment of the armored units must be
carefully timed and coordinated with the attack objectives
of the other forces Local air superiority during
the period - of the counteroffensive or major counterattack
is a prerequisite to success of the operations
Usually the armored attack should bedelivered to disrupt
the continuity of the hostile offensive and not
merely to restore the defensive position
8 Logistical considerations :-a' Where prolonged_
operations of armored divisions and corps or GHQ tank
units_ are contemplated adequate arrangements must be
made by the higher headquarters to insure timely re
plenishment of supplies 'required by the armored' units
Where the armored units are required to operate at
great distances from their base of supplies when'continuity
of supply is interrupted by eneuW action - and
in other emergency situations delivery of urgent supplies
may be_made by air
b As - a general guide to the logistical capabilities
of armored divisions the following -expressed in terms
of days of supply are the maximum supplies carried
organically:
Class --3 days (including one ""D"" ration) in units
plus day in -ouartermpster battalion
Anmuuuition_: 2 days! supply of small arms 37-mm
60-mm mortar ; day's supply 8 -mm mortar 05-mss
howitzer and 75--pan AT guns -
Gasoline and oil : 2 days' supply
In addition the quarteiuraster battalion of the
armored division can carry 20 tons of ammunition or
gasoline and oil (over and above the norral division
reserve of day's supply of Class I -- 40 tons)
c The following are the approximate tonnages of
day's supply of the indicated items for an armored division
:
Ammunition all class 600 tons
-7-
TC 3
tlasoli ne and oil- (assumed average operating
distance - 00 miler
220 tons
Class 40 tons
d Where several armored divisions or GIIQ tank
units are under control of one headquarters consideration
should be given to retaining one or more division
or GHQ tank units in reserve either for the purpose of
extending combat operations or of relieving similar
units to permit necessary maintenance and replacement
operations In this manner continuity of the operation
and necessary maintenance rest and replacement will
be assured

GENERAL
â 77 The strategic offensive retains the initiative ; it permits
the highoermc'manderto direct his movements and employ
his forces in a decisive effort in accordance with his plans
Its psychological advantage is great ; it provides a powerful
stimulus to the war efforts of both the civil and military
components of the nation Initiated with surprise and
energetically followed through it throws the opponent off
balance and on the defensive from which he may be unable
to change until decisively defeated or until the accomplishment
of the mission assigned the forces initiating the offensive
has been achieved
â 78 The strategic offensive demands great initial impetus
continuity of effort and flexible dispositions so that its culmination
in battle will find the offensive force capable of
launching decisive destructive blows against the enemy
forces For decisive results in modern warfare it is essential
that the offensive forces have air superiority in the areas of
decisive operations Combat aviation and motorization have
increased striking power both for the offensive and defensive
forces but the offensive force still has the advantage of in-

The defender on the other - hand must concounteract
form not only to the general movements but must Pared to meet the many capabilities of his"" opponent This may tend to disperse the defender and weaken him at areas which are or lead to decisive strategic objectives of the attacker
7 79 The Maintenance of routes of communication in hos- tile territory presents numerous difficulties Large rein- forcements in personnel munitions and equipment must be kept moving forward It may be necessary to employ conâ¢ siderable forces in investing or contain+ ng fortresses or large fortlfled areas and holding and exploiting the occupied areas of enemy territory The inhabitants as Well as parachute troops can be expected to interfere with the gaining and transmitting of information and with the maintenance of supply lines as well as to engage in guerilla operations Care- ful estimate of the situation will enable the commander to foresee many of the difficulties which may be encountered and provide for timely measures to meet them effectively without diminishing unduly the power of or resources re- quired for his decisive movements
! 80 Whether the strategic offensive can be initiated in all theaters at the same time will depend upon many factors among which are the mission of the armed'forces the relative strengths of friendly and enemy forces terrain lines of com- munication and defensive or other strategic requirements in certain areas With Inadequate forces the strategic offen- sive should rarely be undertaken in secondary theaters When such an offensive is necessary it must be launched with boldness rapidity and surprise The assumption of the strategic defensive in one or more theaters may permit the decision to be reached in the primary area of operations For the doctrines concerning main and secondary attacks see FM 00-5

â 8 Strategic offensive maneuvers have for their purposea
Forcing the enemy to accept combat under co nditions
favorable to the attacker
b Forcing the enemy to abandon his will to contin ue warlike
operations by occupying or seriously threaten ing_his vital
areas
Since the second contingency will rarely be achieved without
battle the culmination of the offensive maneuver will
ordinarily find the opponent ceasing to maneuver and taking
position from which to receive the attack in an area most
favorable to him and in accord with his strategic requirements
When this condition is reached offensive operations
will be continued to gain tactical success by break-through
envelopment or turning I:aovement
U 82 Offensive operations on interior lines consist of maneuvers
from a central location against enemy forces advancing
along convergent lines or against enemy forces of two allied
countries which are separated by the common opponent of
both The advantage of interior lines is increased as the
distance separating the converging or otherwise separated
hostile forces is increased Time and space initially favor
forces operating on interior lines This advantage is at the
maximum when the separated forces can be struck and defeated
in detail before one can come to the assistance of the
other This necessary delay of separated forces may be
gained by employing against one or more of them small
highly mobile forces whose primary mission is delay yet
which can strike hard offensive blows against an overanxious
or rash enemy
THE EkEAK-THROUGH
83 The strategic break-through may consist of a decisive
blow launched in one area or of penetrations with decisive
blows launched in two or more areas The purpose of both
is an advance deep into hostile territory to encircle and destroy
or capture large hostile forces or to seize strategically
important areas
r 84 Break-through operations launched in one area have
for their primary objective the separation of the enemy's
forces into two parts followed by the envelopment or encircle-
3 3
84-86 FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
ment and defeat or rated destruction of one or both of the sepa- parts
A 85 Break-through operations launched in two or more areas will ordinarily envisage the function of the highly mo- bile leading elements of each penetrating force in rear of the hostile rear areas or other objective They further provide for the closing of the pincers thus formed and annihilation or capitulation of the forces surrounded or the capture or investment of the strategic objective encircled The break- through forces must be prepared to meet enemy counterat- tacks from the encircled enemy forces as well as from those outside the encirclements The maintenance of strong pres- sure on the hostile front between as well as on areas outside and adjacent to the areas of penetration tends to fix the enemy In those areas and restrict maneuver of his forward elements

â 87 It is essential that the offensive forces have air
superiority and that this air superiorit is maintained
t roug tout t to operation Combat aviation not only assists
the break-through operations by attacks against hostile
ground forces in contact but by attacks against large enemy
reserves which may be employed to assist the defender and
y pro- ng pursuitProtection over the area of operations
(See ch 7 ) Aviation has a major function of gaining
and transmitting impo taut information prior to the initiation
of the operation and of reporting events on the field
of battle as well as those distant from the scene of operations
which may eventually influence the outcome of the
operations It must exert every effort to gain and transmit
this information Air superiority itself is a tremendous
factor in preventintfte enemy from gaining timely information
It may prove decisive In gaining surprise over the
enemy
N 88 Modern means of combat have placed in the hands
of the higher commender weapons of speed and striking
power which permit h+m to plan well in advance and employ
these means decisively in the break-through and subsequent
encirclement and effectively to meet changes in the situation
A 89 A break-through operation launched with insufficient
striking and exploiting force runs the grave risk of failing to
break through the hostile defensive areas and of merely
bending the hostile front This in turn may subject the
attacking force to strong enemy counterattacks or to a hostile
counteroffensive
90 When terrain and other conditions permit large armored
formations may be effectively and decisively employed
as the leading elements of the task forces employed in the
break-through operations They are capable of thrusting
themselves into and through the hostile dispositions as a
wedge and in such formation as to assure protection initially
of their own flanks This wedge formation also furnishes
some security to the flanks of the other ground elements
which are following the armored formations The armored
formations open the why for the timely advance of other
ground troops which widen the breach and strike the flanks

and rear which have been maintained exposed Pressure is continuously on the hostile front between and adjacent to the areas of break-through Missions assigned the armored formations will be governed by the object
to be attained In one situation they may constitute an element of the en- circlement force whose task
major hostile to envelop and destroy a force In another they may be assigned stra- tegic area objectives for the Purpose of destroying hostile lines of communication blocking movement of large reserves or capturing facilities vital to the opposing force while the encirclement and destruction of the forward hostile elements is assigned to other ground units Against a retreating force they may be employed to gain the rear or flank of this force and block its retreat while less mobile elements advance to complete the destruction or cause the surrender of the enemy In whatever maneuver the components of the break-through forces are employed the forces must be so organized and of sufficient strength to execute a complete break-through and the plans must be so flexible that full advantage can be taken by mobile hard-striking forces of changes in the situation favorable to the friendly forces This also requires a thoroughly adequate signal communication system (See also ch 9 )
If 9 The selection of the area or areas for the break- through will be Influenced strongly by the objective (whether enemy forces or vital areas) by the suitability of terrain throughout the area for operations by the forces to be employed by dispositions of the hostile forges including large reserves and the time required to move adequate forces to the area In some situations it may be desirable to select an area in which terrain is less favorable when by so doing combat intelligence Indicates less hostile resistance is to be expected and surprise as to direction and intensity of the advance and attack is gained When the opposing forces are composed of armies of two or more allied nations the area at which such armies make contact along their front may be particularly suitable for the break-through This consideration also applies though to a lesser degree to the area of contact between two armies It is in these areas that coordination and cooperation are often weakest and
36
LxRGER UNITS 9 -95
where national jealousies or conflicting aims weaken the
opponent Large salients along the opposing fronts may offer
especially favorable areas for the break-through since in
these areas exposed hostile flanks already exist
9 92 Full advantage must be taken of all means to deceive
the opposing commander With plentiful lateral routes of
communication and modern means of combat and transportation
it may under certain conditions be feasible to
build up a strong force in one area attack with a part of this
force follow this attack with the secret movement of the
mass of the assembled force to the area where the decisive
effort is to be made and strike in that area Such an operation
requires that forces sufficient to effect a strong continuing
blow be employed in the area of initial concentration
Otherwise there will be little deception since the enemy
may be able to block the original attack with minimum forces
and meet effectively the forces intended for the decisive
effort and the advantages of mobility will be lost
THE ENVELOPMENT
p 93 The enveloping maneuver may be initiated off the field
of battle after contact has been gained ; or it may be the
decisive action following the break-through
0 94 The strategic objective the terrain the relative
strengths of opposing forces and the enemy situation may
be such as not only to Indicate but to make advantageous
the Initiation of movements off the battlefield by the enveloping
forces - Such movements will often facilitate the surprise
execution of the envelopment simultaneously with or following
the fixation of the hostile forces by those friendly forces
which make contact frontally This maneuver should not
ordinarily contemplate the movement of the two component
parts beyond mutually supporting distance (See FM 00-5 )
However the size of each should be such that it can maintain
itself against the enemy It is highly desirable that the
enveloping forces move secretly and strike with surprise
â 95 An envelopment may be'the result of an advance so
planned and executed as to be in sufficient width to extend
beyond one or both flanks of the hostile forces In such an

more armored divisions and certainorganic and auxiliary units termed corps troopsc The armored division is a self-contained unit of the several arms and services organized tactically and administratively for independent actionIt may be attached foroperation with an infantry or a cavalry corpsd The GHQ reserve tank group contains a headquartersand headquarters detachment and three GHQ reserve tankbattalions of either light or medium tanks or bothIv	l2-5ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUALTACTICS ANDe The GHQ reserve battalions are self-contained units ofeither light or medium tanks organized tactically and administratively for employment by battalion or by group to furnishadditional striking power to other ground forces includingr mored divisions and corps Trained as units they are immediately adaptable to inclusion in larger groupings of otherground troops 3 CHARACTERISTICS -The characteristics of Armored Forceunits are :a Mobility -All combat units are mounted in armoredmotor vehiclesb Fire power -Through a multiplicity of weapons mountedon the vehiclesc Armor protection -All combat vehicles are protected byarmor of varying thickness capable of withstanding at leastrifle fired Shock action -Accomplished by the combination of theother characteristics and by the weight and crushing powerof the major vehicles0 4 METHODS OF EMPLOYING ELEMENTS OF ARMORED FORCE Operations of components of the Armored Force may atvarious times or simultaneously involvea The attachment of GHQ tank battalions and groups toinfantry cavalry and armored divisions or corpsb The grouping of armored divisions corps or GHQ tankgroups with other corps or field armies for combinedoperationsc The employment by the field or theater commander ofarmored divisions and corps on independent or semiindependent missions without reinforcing logistical means oradditional supporting troops other than combat and reconnaissance 'aviationd Operation as task forces wherein armored divisions orcorps or at times GHQ reserve tank units are teamed withmotorized divisions antitank battalions antiaircraft 'automatic weapons battalions and GHQ engineer maintenanceand supply units closely supported by combat aviation parachute and other troops transported by air 5 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS -Larger units of the ArmoredForce properly utilized either separately or in combination2iTECHNIQUEwith other means can achieve rapid decisive resultsin thearea of employment They are to be employed on decisivemissions They must not be frittered away on unimportantA mission far in advance of other main forces isobjectivesjustified when the operation will obtain decisive results butmust be closely supported by other equally mobile troopsTheir proper utilization necessitates a definite appreciationand a careful consideration of the several characteristics ofthe Armored Force unitsa The conditions which should exist or be created for theirsuccessful action are air superiority in the decisive area ofemployment surprise favorable terrain and absence of orneutralization of massed defensive meansb The mobility of armored units permits great latitude inthe choice of direction and the method of attackThe decision as to whether the attack will be executed as a turningmovement envelopment or penetration will be determinedlargely by the time factor involved by the terrain and bythe hostile dispositions including hostile rear installationsThe most suitable areas for the employment of Armored Forceunits are on the open flanks or through existing gaps createdby penetrations of the enemy's positionsc The assignment of missions or objectives to armoredunits must be preceded by a careful consideration of the moreimportant factors which affect the operation of the armoredand other units associated in the operations These factorsare : weather terrain throughout the entire area of contemplated operation nature of the enemy and his methods ofcombat availability of other supporting troops and especiallyadequate space and road net for the operation of the unitsconcernedThe axis of advance of the major armored andmotorized units will be along roadsd The most decisive results will be gained from the grouping of overpowering masses of armored units and launchingthem against vital objectives deep in the hostile rear Thearmored mass must be supported by sufficient means to maintain its momentum until the objective has been attainede The most effective and decisive application of the mobility and power of large armored and motorized combinations will often necessitate the decentralization of control tothe appropriate commanders who will be guided only by thebroad general plan of the higher headquartersAfter the3	ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUALTACTICS AND TECHNIQUEinitiation of the operation however the superior commandermust keep the armored unit commanders constantly informedof the situationf The maximum development of the demoralizing powerof the larger armored formations will be dependent in a largemeasure on the continuous support of adequate reconnaissanceand observation aviation and timely assistance of combataviation in overcoming critical ground resistance beyond theability of available artillery This should be assured by directarrangement between air and armored unit commanders andby adequate air-ground signal communication netsHighercommanders can enhance the effectiveness of supportingaviation by habitually assigning the same air and ground unitsto work together as a task force or teamg The sustained mobility of armored and motorized unitsis dependent upon adequate timely replenishment of requiredsupplies especially fuel and to a lesser degree oil and lubricantsRegular vehicle maintenance must be continuedWhen operations are to be prolonged for several days it mustbe appreciated that armored and motorized units must haveopportunity for daily maintenanceh Because of their mass employment armored and motorized units are difficult to conceal during approach and development Elaborate measures for deception and surprise will berequired often and may involve variously : advance stockageand concealment of essential supplies ; improvising and concentrating dummy armored vehicles or marked activity ofactual units in localities distant from that of contemplatedemployment ; extensive

"g is ava il able, then the
infantry must act aside one or two squads of men equipped -pith picks and shovels
for this purpose . In an emergency any soldiers nearby the tank that is having -
difficulty must be prepared to come to the assistance of the tank to help it over
the obstacle, as the value of the tank in continuing the advance is well worth the
use of riflemen for this purpose .
""Tanks should habitu sl ly lead the infantry in the attack:' Infantry scouts
may ride on the backs of the tanks as far forward as hostile machine gun and rifle
fire gill permit, and then continue in close proximity to the tanks to point oix ;
to them to-rgets and assist them in getting over bad terrain . The infantry assailiiâ¢
should follow the tanks closely as possible so as to promptly take advantage of
the ground gained by the tanks . The distance behind the tanks will depend
principall y on the rule that the infantry . should not follow the tanks so close
as to come under the artillery and other fires which are directed on the line of
tanks . As previously stated, this aistance varies with the terrain, and with the
type and amount of hostile fire being received . If the terrain has been studied
carefully prior to the attack, the tanks -rill know that they can reach a certain
line and then will have to halt and take turret defiladed positions while the
infantry passes through them and establishes a bridgehead on the further side of
the_ obstacle . Artillery, infantry mortars, and the fire from the tanks should
cover the establishment of the bridgehead which:noxmall y should include smoke to
screen the advance and the bridging operations . As soon as the bridgehead is
established or the smoke screen is laid, the tanks should advance promptly and
cross the obstacle . Members of each tank crew should promptly reconnoiter on
foot for the best crossing site and mgrn detailed to assist the the tanks should
begin the preparation of. the crossings . The tanks should cross immediately after
the crossing is prepared and be covered by' the fire of tanks remaining in position ;
all the tanks should get across as soon as possible . Prior to crossing the
obstacle, the tanker should study the terrain and have well in mind where he is
to go upon reaching the other side . After crossing the obstacle, the tanker goes
-through the infantry line and leads the advance until he is again stopped by
unfavorable terrain, minefields or concentrations of antitank weapons . In case
of antitank weapons, artillery fire will be c fled to neutralize them, in case of
minefields, reconnaissance -rill be made to find a passage through or special means
brought up to blow a passage through so that the tank can continue the advance ; in
caso of another obstacle the infantry will have to come up and establish another
bridgehead .

""Special provisions should be made by commanders to have infantry or
other troops close behind the tanks to take over prisoners . On many occasions in
the past, large numbers have surrendered to the tankers and have escaped later for
lack of an escort to take them to the rear . While the attack is in progress tanks_
should not be taken from the battlefront to escort prisoners to the rear unless
it is an emergency . Where large groups of prisoners are taken, the tanker may
have to escort them until friendly forces can take them over . Planning should
provide means to take this burden off the tanker and permit him to continue in
the assault .
""The antitank gun is a tremendous asset in the advance of the tanks and
is an absolute necessity where the hostile to ks are superior in numbers or in
armor and armament to our own tanks . It, therefore, will be the practice to
attach tank destroyer units to the assault tank units . The tank destroyer units
will follow the tanks closely from one hull down position to another so as to be
able to cover the advance of the tanks with direct fire . The closest cooperation
and means of communication between the tanks and the tank destroyers is essenti4 .
tiyihen the infantry is attacking without tanks but with tank destroyers, the same
principles apply for the use of the tank destroyers with the infantry .
""It is a fixed rule and a point of honor that neither our tanks or tank
destroyers will permit their infantry to' be overrun by hostile tanks, no matter
what it costs to themselves .
""Upon reaching the objective the tanker and tank destroyer must remain on
the objective until the position is secured and the danger from counterattack by
either infantry or tanks, or a combination of both, has been eliminated . Thereafter
certain tanks and tank destroyers may be required to remain on the objecti : s .
or close thereto while the others may proceed on another mission or go into reser
to refuel and refit .
""Provisions must be made in the employment of both tanks and tank destroyers
for replacing the armored elements in the assault when they have to go to the
rear to replenish their ammunition or gas without the loss of tanks and tank destroyer
support . This is highly important . Reserve platoons of tanks and tank
destroyer elements must be prepared to move to the front Promptly to make the replacement
. The relief must he made so that there will be continuity of armored
support .
""The above principles will be taught to all tankers, tank destroyer
personnel and all infantry. 1--itch has been said about what armor will do in
battle . Let us make good our promise of support . Let the infantry follow us
closely and assist us to get forward and thereby have established between_ the .
: :armor, artillery and infantry that ' utual respect and comradeship on the battle-.
field which is so essential to the success of our cause .""
1, . Observe the Principles of Mass,.
Many attacks during the African and particularly in the Italian campaigns
failed because the principle of mass was not observed . This permitted the enemy
9
r
to move his reserves freely from one part: of the battlefield to another . A good
rule to fo?low is : ""If you think you can take an objective with a tooth pick,
use a baseball bat to make sure ."" The hissing of artillery fires in particular
was a development of the Anzio Beachhead which had an outstanding' effect on the
successful defense .
Beware of attempting to deceive the enemy by sneaking up on them and .
not employing all your fire power . It is better to come in with all guns blazing .
One of the greatest losses sustained in my own division was in'an action where the
high command decided to do away with the artillery preparation in the false hope -
that the enemy would be surprised . The enemy not only were not surprised but were
waiting for the attack with the result that the infantry suffered severe losses
which would not have occurred had the artillery laid down a curtain of fire to
protect them .
We sailed into Safi harbor in North Africa quietly, waiting for the French
to fire the first shot, whereas how much better it would have been if we could have
come in with all guns blazing, to neutralize the shore
batteries and insta ll ations that were waiting for us and which had been accurately
located.
Throughout the African and Italian campaigns there was a continued demand
to split the armored division and attach part of its troops to another force .
The armored division, like any other division had been developed as a team, and
the full success of its power can only be reaped when it acts as a unit and has
all of its strength available for use . -
5 . Air Support .
There was very little close support by air for ground troops in either
the African or Italian campaigns . In the African can-mai gn the air was mainly used
on strategical missions and on missions for the good of the force as a whole . This
was partially due, at least initially, to the lack of strength in the air at that
time . There is no attempt here to belittle or minimize the wonderful work of the
air in assisting the campaign as a whole, the destruction of the e :iem-y's lines of
communication, supply, etc, Ho>wrever, the close teamwork between the ground and
the air was lacking . Tactical teanm-rork between the air and the ground, particularly
with an armored division, has great possibilities . The air must
receive special training in order to give this essential close cooperation .
In the first place, the air will require intensive training in locating
itself on the ground and in picking . up landmarks and coordinates . Our forces were
repeatedly strafed by our own air by failure of . our _airmen to recognize our own
vehicles end to know where they were at the time . Fortunately, the losses sustained
were relatively light from this cause, but is created a distinct feeling
among the ground forces that our air could not be trusted to wor'!c closely with
ua end in a desire for the air to work- on morn distant targets giving a wider
jar,-:,in of territory between the enemy to be worked on and our own advanced
elements .
10
The lst Armored Division, toward the latter part of the Italian campaign,
carried out an experiment with a fighter-bomber group in an effort to develop
closer cooperation and to obtain close in air support . The work was carried out
with a great deal of enthusiasm by both the air and the armored division and great
progress was made . The principal difficulty was in communications and in
accurately describing to the air the targets to be worked on . Cub planes were
painted yellow on their top wing surfaces and hovered over the hostile targets .
They then described the targets to the incoming fighter-bombers . This worked out
in a highly satisfactory manner after a little experimentation, but the main
difficulty with this system will be that after the enemy has control or partial
control of the air, the Cub plane will not be able to live in the air long enough
to describe the target .
The - greatest single aid to more effective use of armored formations,
particularly in pursuit and where they are moving fast beyond close artillery
support, would be the development of close air support by reconnaissance, strafing,
and bombing . Failure of this air support presents the weakest link in our tactical
team today. Let no one think that this close support can be quickly worked out or
that because a system has been developed with one division that the same system
can be employed with another division without first going through an intensive
training period with both the air and ground people involved . It can be done, an3_
it has been done, and the results are tremendously effective . Although the Air
Service has been apparently reluctant to go into this work in the past, we find
that the air people who are engaged in it and who have worked and overcome the
difficulties of communications with the ground people are most enthusiastic about
the results obtained . This cooperation requires special communication equipment,
special crews to be set up, and intensive training in map reading, orientation,
kn(m ledGc of ground vehicles and weapons, and their principles of operation .
6. The -Fallacy of Attaching Tanks Tank Destroyers, and Antiaircraft
Battalions to Division .
our present system is to attach G .H.Q . tank battalions, tank destroyer
batt ali ons, and antiaircraft battalions to divisions . This has not proven satisfactory,
principall y for the following reasons
First, the team play absolutely essential between these elements and the
infantry and artillery of the divisions to which attached is not developed to the
high degree necessary for successful action . One battalion serves with a division
for a while and then is transferred to another division, sometimes in a short
period of time, and they do not have the opportunity to work out team play .
Second, those small separate battalions are often commanded indifferently, and no
one looks after them to see that they have good leadership ; whereas, if they were
permanently a part of a d vision, the weakness in -leadership v ould be - appare:r_t,
and the division corniander would take necessary action . Third, they are like
orphans in the storm . No one looks after them . They suffer in personnel and
maintenance requirements and are shifted around here and there from one corps to
another or from one division to another with no one having a personal in+to~ â¢est
in then except the battalion commander himself . The above are very highly practical
considerations although theoreticall y their needs are not so apparent .
11
Panzer Grenadier units of the German Amy all contain organic tank elements
. As long as the tank is so important on the battlefield, our infantry
divisions should have organic tank battalions with them .. The antiaircraft batteries
normally trith divisions are equipped with automatic weapons and are usually
split up to protect the division artillery and the movement of infantry in trucks
and also some of the installations of the division such as headquarters and supply
establishments . These units should also work constantly with the same division
although the requirement is less important since they have a mere passive defensive
role than is true of the tank destroyer and tank battalions .
-
7. The Tank Division vs . G. H . Q. Tank Battalions.
The quality of the G .H.Q. tank battalion in training for battle, aggra.=:-
si_veness, and general all-around efficiency was far below the standard of the tart
battalion in the armored division. There was a continual demand from infantry
divisions to get tank units from the armored divisions attached to them for attacks
that were the normal objectives for G.H .,Q. tank battali ons . The reason given in
all cases was that the tank units of the armored divisions were so much better
trained and has a better fighting spirit and morale than the G .H .Q. tank battalion$
Unfortunately, this attitude was generally correct, and the G .H .Q. tank battali ons .
with notable exceptions, did not do the'work that should be expected of them .
However, there were reasons for this which have been touched upon in the preceding
paragraph .
In the armored divisions, the tank battalions were trained with the
infantry and artillery-of the division as a coordinated team . They had the
benefit of a division commander to look after their leadership, personnel require-
.-melts, supply anti maintenance problems . These items were lacking in the G .H .Q .
tank battalions which were left on their own in practic ally all of the above items .
Several times during the campaigns officers from the 1st Armored Division
were sent over to take command of G .H .Q. tank battalions and replace their commanders
. The effect of this leadership was instantly apparent . Prior to the
breakout in the Anzio Beachhead all of the separate tank battalions in the beachhead
were put under the command of the lst Armored Division for training, supply
maintenance, and administration . This directive ryas enthusiastically received by
the G .H .Q. tank battalions who realized they now had someone who understood their
problems and would help them get what they needed to function .
The above discussion brings up the question of whether there should be
G.H .Q . tank battalions or armored divisions or both and how they should operate .
There should be both . There should be armored divisions 'with a powerful tank
component for breakthroughs, for exploitation, for pursuit, etc . There-should also
be . tank elements as . component parts of P11- infantry divisions . I believe the
solution to the problem is the armored division and the tank battalion as a component
part of the infantry division . Let us not operate as we did prior to this
war, with the infantry developing tanks in one direction and the cavalry in another
and with a development of jealoucy and incompetency in all directions .
12
The British and Germans both employ a heavy tank as the accompanying tank
for infantry. Many arj .unents can be brought in on both sides, but after all is
said, the main thing in a tank is gunpower and maneuverability . By msneuvTerability
I do not mean speed on roads . I mean ability to negotiate terrain and
get over roads and bridges which is just as essential to an infantry accompanying
tank as to any other tank . If the above plan is adhered to it till be seen that
the same type of tank is required whether it closely supports the infantry in
taking limited objectives or whether it is part of an armored division which is
predominantly strong in tanks to smash through defensive lines or to sweep
around the flanks and rear of hostile positions .
8. Tar& vs . Tank Destroyer and Antitank Gun .
The antitank gun is a necessity on the battlefield for the infantry .
It should be a towed weapon reasonably easy to Manhandle, with a high muzzle
velocity.
There is no need for tank destroyers . I believe the whole organization
development of the tank destroyer will be considered a great mistake of the vrar .
In the first place, the doctrine orginally promulgated, of the tank destroyer
seeking out and pursuing the tank was a fall y which caused the destruction of
many lives and much equipment before it was corrected . The tank destroyer M-10,
now in use, has proven of great benefit simply because it contained a 3 inch
gun that was the best gun for coping with the Tiger and Panther German tanks .
Had this gun or a more powerful gun been installed in a tank, there would have
been no need for the tank destroyer .
The 37 TD mounted on a 3/4 ton chassis and a 75 gun mounted on a half
track as tank destroyer weapons were absurd and could not possibly take the place
even of the Grant tank with a 75 gun . The most effective use for tank destroyers
was found to be to split them up into platoons and attach them to tank companies
and tank- battal ions to furnish the e _tra--gunpower required when the superior Gerrna' :
tank eras met on the battlefield . The German, up to now, has had superiority in
tanks and tank gunpower in his Tiger and Panther tanks with their high velocity
88 and 76 calibre guns . Our 3 inch gun in the tank destroyer and our heavy
artillery were the only antidctes although our %i-4 medium tack was a much superior
tank except for its gun and axmor.
The Germans have self-propelled guns on the same principle as our selfpropelled
artillery in the armored divisions except that they went to higher calibres
than the 105 . They used these guns as roving guns on the battlefield and as
such they were highly successful, but no more so than our ownn self-propelled guns
accept as to the weight of the artillery piece involved . The foreign armies have
always been. ahead of us in the development of high velocity pieces of ordnance, and
for the last two years our troops have been continually outgunned by German pieces
of ordnance . When the day comes that we equip our tanks with a high velocity and
heavy calibre gun, there will be no need for tank destroyers as such, and they
should be eliminated along with their overhead, etc . The artillery of the Army
should develop both self-propelled and towed equipment as both have their use on
the battlefield, and both have proven their worth beyond discussion .
13
Repace63-ntsandReplaccanent Training.
The replacement situation was not very satisfactory in the African and
Italian campaigns . During the African campaign the 2d Armored Division was used
in large part to furnish replacements to keep the 1st Armored Division in battle .
Although some 19,000 highly trained armored force replacements arrived in Africa,
these men were used to create new service units and were lost for their original
purpose.
After the Mount Portia fight in Italy, the 6th Infantry of the 1st Arreorer
Division lost heavily and had to fill its ranks with truck drivers,_ tank destroyer
and tank personnel due to lack of infantry replacements .
In general, the replacements are not suited by training to take over the r
duties in combat . Unfortunately, the replacements received often had to go into
the fight immediately and had no opportunity to be trained in their combat duties .
Replacements of both officers and men came to the theater with higher rank than
they were able to hold due ~,o lack of experience and training in the unit to which
sent . As a result, many of the officer replacements could not be used and had to
be carried as surplus . This blocked the promotion cf deserving men . A great
many of the enlisted replacements had to, be reduced in grade as they were incapable
of holding down the job to which they had been promoted .. Many of the enlisted -men
asked to be reduced after they themselves realized that they were incompetent .
There would have been a far more efficient ystem if enlisted replacements were
generally confined to basic privates and the officers here Second Lieutenants,
thereby allowing the unit to promote its deserving and experienced men to fill tha
higher vacancies . It would then have been possible to fill in at the bottom wits
fresh men from the States . There would be exceptions to this rule as o;;cca-sion'al,
high ranking officers became casualties, and no suitable replacements were available
in the unit . However, in most cases there were suitable men to fill their
places within the- unit, and if not within the unit it-oe1f, officers from adjacent
divisions could be found to transfer over and become promoted thereby . These men
had the battle experience necessary to carry on in an efficient manner while the
battle was still in progress .
A general impression was gained that replacements from the States were
not given sufficient intensive combat -training but instead were trained generally
to -fill various specialists' ratings and that their training covered a broad field
rather than having the fundamentals for combat stressed . There was small call for
clerks and administrative personnel as this type did not suffer the heavy casualties
. On the other hand, there was a great deniand for the private soldier ad the
junior officer to fill the depleted ranks of the front line combat platoons and
companies .
As a constructive criticism I believe less time should be given to the
training in current events and all of the various items that have to be included
on the man's service records as having been accomplished such as seeing a certain
course of movies or listening to a certain course of lectures or having been
psychoanalyzed . More time could then be spent on the fundamental drill and training
to fit the man for combat work in the front line .
1 4
As soon as replacements arrived they were immediately given intensive
training in these fundamental combat duties which were so evidently lacking .
However, as stated above, it was the unfortunate rule rather than the exception
that, the men arrived and were, within twenty-four hours, put into the battle line .
They had to learn in the hardest way without having been given sufficient opportunity
for training . This situation was particularly true during a long sustained
drive where it was essential that the units be kept up to strength in order to
continue the attack .
10 . Infantry.
The infantry in this war, as in all other wars-, has the heaviest casualties
. However, their casualties would have been less had they been more soundl :-
trained in the fundamentals and to operate more closely and efficiently with tanks
and artillery. I believe it to be a fallacy to ca""11 the infantry ""the queen of
battles"" because on the modern battlefield there is no king or queen, nor is any
branch of service more important than another . They all have equal importance if
the team is worked up properly.
3
Our infantry soldier eras given the lowest classification as to intelligence,
which is a:riistake as it takes an in_t elli_&e1_ _man to be_ a good infantry
solda.er. --The principal points which need to be stressed in infantry training are
the fundamentals such as perfection of crew drill, the use of their weapons, and
the fundamental formations to make maximum use of cover, terrain, and dispersion
as they advance under fire .
Relative to tack-infantry cooperation, if the assault is on a definite
single objective, the infantry should be in position to att;:"".k before the .tanks
arrive whenever practicable. Oftentime the infantry in position can observe
elements in the situation which were not known or considered in the planning for
the attack .
Assault guns were used as infantry direct fire support weapons on several
occasions where the tanks had by-passed enemy strong points . The enemy infantry
at these strong points engaged our infantry but were soon dispersed by direct fire
assault gun_ support .
A good football team uses about eight to ten plays during a season,
these plays are fully developed, and every man thoroughly understands them . He
is drilled for hours in the fundamentals . A mediocre football team often has
thirty to forty plays none of which are successful as no play is fully understood
nor are the men thoroughly drilled day after day in the fundamentals . Good
infantry is the same as a good_ .football team and must concentratc__o :z_a few forma-
_tions and drill constantly -to perfect themselves . The following are some constructive
criticisms that have been made during the training of the 6th Infantry
prior to combat and are well worth considering in our preliminary battle training
in the States :

OMPONENTS OF THE ARMORED DIVISION
Section I
TANK BRIGADE
24 . Because of its large number of guns and machine guns of
various calibers, its speed of going into action and its maneuverability,
the tank brigade can concentrate a heavy volume of fire on
all targets . Its cross-country performance and armor enable it
to exploit this fire power against the enemy at most effective
ranges .
25 . The success of the tank brigade depends upon its employment
in mass formation and the concentration of the largest possible
number of tanks to gain surprise in deep thrusts against the
enemy's weak spots.
26 . In all situations the success of the tank brigade is primarily
dependent upon the personal leadership of the commander .
27. He carries out the reconnaissance of ground on which the
conduct of the tank battle depends . On the basis of the division
order, his knowledge of the terrain, and reconnaissance, he lays
down the detailed order of battle for his brigade, its main line of
attack, and its frontage and depth .
The tank brigade can be employed either in frontal or flank
attack, and in several waves . The method depends upon the
task, the terrain, the degree of resistance expected from the
enemy, and the depth of the enemy's defensive zone . In general,
flank attack is preferred .
When the situation is uncertain or the attack made over dead
ground, it may be desirable to employ at first only a few elements,
holding the remainder of the force in close reserve . The first
wave of tanks must be given sufficient tanks with heavy caliber
guns to insure that the enemy's antitank defense is quickly and
surely neutralized .
465680Â°-42---3
28. On the basis of division orders, the brigade commander
lays down the method of cooperation between tank regiments and
supporting arms . During the battle he gives orders either
verbally or by radio to the artillery regimental or battery commanc:
er accompanying him,
29. During the attack the brigade commander keeps the division
constantly informed of the progress of the attack and of the objectives
gained . On reaching objectives he decides whether the
regiments are to be organized to pursue the attack or to reassemble
under division orders .
30. During the attack the brigade commander directs his
unit by means of radio . He has for this purpose the brigade
signal platoon, which is detached from the division armored
signal battalion . The nature of the task, the situation, and the
allotment of other arms will from time to time necessitate change
in the use of radio communications . Normally, the brigade
commander will maintain radio contact with the division, his
regiments, and the artillery. It may also be necessary, however,
to establish radio communications with the motorized infantry
and air force reconnaissance units, as well as with antitank troops .
The brigade commander must make an early decision as to what
communications are absolutely essential and whether an additional
allotment is required from the division .
Radio communications from reconnaissance aviation working
with the tanks may, if necessary, be supplemented by message
dropping .
31 . If task forces are formed, the commander of the tank
brigade will normally command one of them .
Section II
MOTORIZED INFANTRY BRIGADE
32. The main effort of the armored division falls upon the
motorized infantry brigade when the nature of the ground and
tank obstacles prevent use of the tank brigade, and when it is
essential to exploit the speed of the motorized infantry .
33. Equipment of the motorized infantry brigade with armored
transport vehicles enables it to follow the tank brigade in vehicles
over the battlefield, and to fight in close cooperation with the
tanks .
10
The motorized infantry fights on foot, It can, however, engage
an inferior or demoralized enemy without dismounting .
These two methods supplement each other . Transport vehicle
crews must therefore be kept close at hand while the infantry is
fighting dismounted . In those cases where the motorized infantry
brigade is not equipped with armored transport vehicles, it must
dismount as soon as it comes within range of enemy infantry fire,
The motorized infantry brigade moves more quickly than the
tank brigade on roads and tracks .
34 . Equipment of the motorized infantry brigade with a large
number of automatic weapons enables it to hold a broad front,
even against an enemy of considerable strength .
35 . The motorcycle battalion is an especially rapid and adaptable
force . It is particularly fitted to anticipate the enemy in
rapidly occupying important areas, to engage a weak enemy, to
follow closely behind a tank attack, especially at night, in order
to provide the tank brigade with necessary infantry protection,
to reinforce the reconnaissance unit, to undertake wide and deep
enveloping movements, to perform protective roles, and to act as
a reserve.
36. The motorized infantry brigade has a signal platoon which
is detached from the division armored signal battalion . On the
move and when advancing deployed in vehicles, communications
will be chiefly by radio . When attacking deployed on foot, wire
communication becomes necessary .
37. If task forces are formed, the commander of the motorized
infantry brigade will normally command one of them .
Section III
ARTILLERY REGIMENT
38. In keeping with the mobility of the armored division, the
artillery must be employed in a mobile and elastic manner . Its
equipment and speed in going into action enable it to give continued
and effective support to the swiftly moving attack of the
division. Its armor and its mobility on self-propelled mounts
permit part of the artillery to follow the tanks, even within range
of enemy infantry weapons, and to go into action from positions
where fire by direct laying is possible . Armored command and
11
observation vehicles enable the officer observing and directing the
artillery fire to accompany the tank attack and to cooperate
closely with the commander of the tank brigade .
39, The relatively small size of the artillery component makes
it necessary that it be allotted only a few tasks of major importance
. Fire of the artillery must be strictly concentrated upon such
targets as cannot be engaged by the tanks .
In an attack against an enemy organized for defense, every
effort must be made to reinforce the division artillery, particularly
with medium batteries. Artillery reinforcements obtained from
the GHQ pool, by their equipment and training, are not so well
fitted for direct support of the tank attack as is the division
artillery . Their primary role should be to engage targets in the
enemy's rear and flanks after the first penetration has been made .
Smoke troops can give effective assistance to artillery .'
40. Artillery spotting planes and the armored observation battery
report enemy gun positions and provide the commander
with valuable supplementary information . They can undertake
tasks of registering and spotting for their own artillery .
Spotting posts of the armored observation battery lying outside
the division's sector must be given protection,
Section IV
ANTITANK BATTALION'
41 . As a result of its speed, mobility, cross-country performance,
and protection against tanks, the antitank battalion can attack
enemy tanks . It unites mobility and fire power in battle . Its
object is to engage and destroy enemy tanks by surprise attack
from an unexpected direction with concentrated fire .
1 Smoke troops are probably attached to the armored divisions only on
special missions . The smoke company is believed to consist of . about 120
officers and enlisted men and 24 vehicles . In addition each company has
eight 81-mm mortars, and it is possible that 100-mm mortars may be
introduced . 2 The antitank battalion comprises headquarters, signal section, three
antitank companies, and probably one antiaircraft company . An antitank
company consists of headquarters, signal section, and three platoons . Each
platoon consists of four sections each armed with one 37-mm AT gun, and
one section armed with two light machine guns. The 37-mm AT guns are
now being replaced in many units by 50-mm AT guns . The antiaircraft
company is believed to consist of twelve 20-mm superheavy AA and AT
machine guns .
1 2
42. In ,addition to engaging enemy tanks, the antitank unit has
the task of neutralizing enemy antitank defenses, thereby sup
porting its own tanks .
43 . Antitank units, especially when supporting motorized
infantry, can also use HE shell to neutralize especially troublesome
enemy defense areas . Heavy antitank units can engage
loopholes of permanent defenses and of fortified houses .
44 . Antitank units will normally be employed in companies .
In an attack against strong enemy tank forces, every endeavor
should be made to employ the battalion in a mass formation . In
engaging loopholes and enemy defense areas, antitank units will
be employed by platoons or with single guns .
Section V
ARMORED ENGINEER BATTALION'
45 . The armored engineer battalion is able to follow tanks
everywhere on the battlefield . In cases where not all the battalion
vehicles are armored or capable of moving across country,
only the armored engineer company of the battalion can be used
in direct support of the tank brigade .
46. The task of the armored engineers is to provide the armored
division on the march and in battle with the necessary facilities for
movement. These include :
a . Seeking out and removing obstacles in the line of advance ;
b . learing lanes through mine fields ;
c. Marking mined areas ;
d. onstructing crossings and bridges with improvised or
standard equipment capable of carrying all vehicles of the armored
division .
In addition, armored engineers cooperate especially in the attack
against permanent defenses .
,
s The armored engineer battalion consists of headquarters, 3 light motorized
companies (possibly only 2 in some cases), 1 motorized heavy bridge
column, and 1 supply park . The motorized companies have 4 officers and
183 enlisted men each, and are armed with 9 light machine guns, 153 rifles,
and 34 pistols . The heavy bridge column comprises all the equipment and
personnel necessary for construction of a bridge of 28-ton capacity . It has
6 officers, 184 enlisted men, and is armed with I light machine gun, 153 rifles,
and 36 pistols . The supply park has 2 officers and 48 enlisted men, and is
armed with 1 light machine gun, 36 rifles, and 14 pistols . The personnel and
engineer equipment is moved in passenger cars, trucks, tractor trailers, and
motorcycles.
13
I
47 . ThePaige number of engineer tasks necessitates economy of
employment . The engineer force must not split up into small
detachments . All other tasks must be subordinated to the main
function of insuring a clear passage for advance of the tank brigade ;
therefore every endeavor must be made to employ the armored
engineers before the tank attack begins .
48. The tank brigade, the motorized infantry brigade, and the
reconnaissance unit each has its own engineer platoon . The
nature of the task, the situation, and the terrain may in some cases
necessitate its reinforcement by parts of the armored engineer
battalion.
Section VI
ARMORED SIGNAL BATTALION 4
49. In keeping with the mobility of the armored division, the
armored signal battalion is well equipped with radio and telephone
equipment . ross-country armored signal vehicles can
accompany the tank attack wherever it goes and supply the communication
necessary for its command .
50 . The chief signal officer of the division must be kept informed
of the current situation, plans, and employment of troops in order
for him to make suitable arrangements for communications .
51 . Radio communications must be insured by employment of
sufficiently powerful sets in point-to-point traffic . In event of
a rapidly moving attack by the armored division, the chief signal
officer must have at his disposal a reserve of radio equipment .
52 . Telephone communications, especially to superior headquarters,
must be maintained as long as possible . It is important
to cooperate with the corps signal unit in pushing forward a main
artery as rapidly and as far as possible .
Existing civilian telephone lines are to be used when possible .
In rapidly moving operations over wide areas, the division commander
decides if and when wire communications are to be
established.
i The signal battalion of an armored division consists of headquarters, an
armored radio company, an armored signal company, and a light combat
train .
14
Section VII
LIGHT ANTIAIR RAFT BATTALION
53. The units of the armored division are vulnerable to attack
by enemy aircraft . It is normally not possible to give protection
to all parts of the armored division . If army antiaircraft units
and heavy air force antiaircraft units are attached to the division,
the employment of all antiaircraft fire power must be unified .
54. The scanty proportion of fire power forces the command
to limit tasks of the light antiaircraft battalion, and to concentrate
them at especially threatened localities .
55 . In cases where the antitank battalion does not possess
guns effective against tanks at longer ranges, heavy antiaircraft
units or single guns will be used in antitank defense and assault
of fixed defenses, according to the principles in paragraphs 42
to 44 .

RE ONNAISSAN E
Section I
GENERAL
56. The rapid movement of an armored division over wide
areas demands forethought in directing and executing reconnaissance
. Reconnaissance will be carried out by the air force reconnaissance
squadron (attached to the armored division) and the
motorized reconnaissance units, augmented by information collected
by the armored observation troop .
57 . Tasks given to the various reconnaissance units must
supplement each other . In view of the small allotment of reconnaissance
forces, supplementary tasks must be allotted for more
detailed reconnaissance in a decisive direction only . Aerial and
ground reconnaissance units must maintain close liaison .
Section II
AIR RE ONNAISSAN E
58. The armored division can obtain its information about the
enemy most rapidly from the air reconnaissance squadron .
59. This air reconnaissance squadron covers objectives 30
miles in front of the foremost parts of the division . At greater
distances the army reconnaissance squadron of the armored corps
is responsible. The limits of reconnaissance on the flanks are
determined by the presence or absence of one's own troops, and
the distances at which they are located .
60 . The air force commander with the armored corps can take
control of the armored division reconnaissance squadron, if
direction of reconnaissance by the armored corps becomes
necessary .
16
61 . In' tical reconnaissance the squadron can )employed
in the following special missions :
a . Watching railways and roads, especially for movements of
tanks, antitank and motorized forces ;
b . Reporting serious obstacles and barriers, and areas suitable
for defense against tanks ;
c . Reporting the nature of the terrain in the line of the division's
advance .
It is of special importance to determine whether there are
enemy forces concentrated to move against the flanks of the
division.
62 . Aerial photography must be planned in advance, as it provides
valuable data for employment of the division,
63 . In air reconnaissance during battle, watching over the
tank brigade is of special importance when the latter is operating
in advance of the other units of the division . Early confirmation
of the positions of enemy antitank guns, the concentration of
enemy tanks, tank obstacles, and ground suitable for tanks is
important. The objectives reached by one's own tanks also should
be reported .
64. Reconnaissance aircraft can give advance warning of
approaching enemy aircraft .
Section III
MOTORIZED RE ONNAISSAN E BATTALION'
65 . The division puts the motorized reconnaissance battalion
well in front when it needs to supplement air reconnaissance
I The motorized reconnaissance battalion of an armored division consists
of headquarters, a motorized signal corps platoon, 2 armored car companies,
1 motorcycle company, 1 heavy weapons company, and a light ammunition
column. The motorized reconnaissance battalion has 12 heavy armored
cars and 42 light armored cars and is armed with 63 light machine guns, 6
heavy machine guns, 12 20-mm machine guns, 3 37-mm antitank guns, 2
75-mm cavalry howitzers, 3 81-mm mortars, and 3 50-mm light mortars .
The armored car companies consist of 6 heavy armored cars and 21 light
and superlight armored cars, and their armament consists of 24 light machine
guns, 1 heavy machine gun, and 6 20-mm machine guns . The motorcycle
company has 8 solo motorcycles, 41 motorcycles with side cars, and 10 light
trucks, and is armed with 9 light machine guns, 4 heavy machine guns, and
3 50-mm light howitzers . The heavy weapons company has 6 light machine
guns, 3 37-nim antitank guns, 2 75-mm cavalry howitzers, and 3 81-mm
mortars .

quickly, when a clear picture of the enemy's dis ,;Jcions can
be obtained only by fighting. The reconnaissance battalion is
fitted for this because of its equipment with armored vehicles and
numerous automatic weapons . To carry out reconnaissance in
battle against a stronger enemy, it must be reinforced .
66 . The motorized reconnaissance battalion is fast, and has a
wide radius of action . It can be employed for distances up to
60 miles. The frontage on which reconnaissance is carried out
will generally be decided by the armored corps . In independent
employment of the division, conditioning factors are estimated
strength of the enemy, number of areas to be reconnoitered, road
conditions, and nature of the terrain . It may extend to 35 miles,
and frequently even more on open flanks .
67 . The abundance of reconnaissance tasks makes it necessary
for the command to concentrate on the essential . Apart from
tasks which any reconnaissance unit may be called upon to carry
out, the motorized battalion must also give early information of
enemy antitank defenses, and by reconnaissance of the terrain
prepare the way for movement of the armored division .
68 . As soon as battle begins, the motorized reconnaissance
battalion must receive orders as to whether it is to continue its
reconnaissance activity, hold temporarily important features,
withdraw through the division, clear the front, or carry out
reconnaissance on the flank. Because of the nature of its composition,
the motorized reconnaissance battalion is not suited for
defensive missions . For example, an open flank may be watched
over by long-range reconnaissance but must be protected by
other troops.
Section IV
UNIT OMBAT RE ONNAISSAN E
69. ombat reconnaissance must be initiated as soon as the
division is deployed . It is supplemented by reconnaissance
platoons of regiments, by the armored pbservation troop, and by
reconnaissance patrols on foot .
70. In combat reconnaissance, the location of enemy antitank
weapons by all arms of the armored division is of special
importance .
18
71 . In cases where the tank brigade and the motorized infantry
brigade are not equipped with tanks for battle reconnaissance,
motorcyclists, infantry in armored transport vehicles, and bicyclists
will carry out the reconnaissance.
Section V
OOPERATION BETWEEN AIR AND GROUND
RE ONNAISSAN E
72 . ooperation between air and ground methods of transmitting
reconnaissance reports must be laid down by the division .
Air reconnaissance will frequently show the motorized reconnaissance
unit the direction in which reconnaissance must be developed
. The motorized reconnaissance unit must have direct radio
communication with the reconnaissance aircraft . If this is not
possible, it will tune in to the reports of the reconnaissance plane .
73 . In order to screen radio traffic, the reconnaissance unit will,
as far as possible, communicate its reports to a station already
known to the enemy . The division will listen in to messages .
74. Reconnaissance pilots can report either by means of radio,
message dropping, or verbally on landing. The most rapid
means is by radio, or by message dropping during flight . Radio
communication is to be preferred as it offers the advantages of
allowing queries to be made from the ground and new tasks to be
communicated to the observer .
As far as radio equipment permits, units of the division should
listen to the air observer .
19
hapter 6
MOVEMENT
Section I
GENERAL
75 . On good roads free of traffic, the following speeds are possible
: full-track vehicles-day 12 mph, night 7 .5 mph ; half-track
vehicles-day 18 mph, night 9 mph ; motorcycles-day 24 mph,
night 12 mph.
In 24 hours the division can move 90 to 120 miles with fulltrack
vehicles, and 150 to 210 miles with other vehicles .
76. Distances covered by the armored division and its freshness
for the battle are influenced to a decisive degree by the terrain
and the road network . Movement of the armored division is
appreciably influenced by unfavorable weather conditions . This
must be taken into account when missions are assigned .
77 . Early and continuous reconnaissance of roads to be used
in the advance is necessary to insure speed of movement . Engineer
reconnaissance of roads must be combined with that of the
reconnaissance units. Valuable assistance can be obtained from
visual reconnaissance and aerial photographs . This road reconnaissance
will be carried out by reconnaissance detachments
under the command of officers . Normally they will be assigned
their tasks by the commanders of the march columns . Frequently
they will have engineers attached so that any obstacles can be
speedily removed. These detachments may also be called upon to
carry out reconnaissance of rest and assembly areas .
The advance of the division must not be delayed by waiting for
fresh reports as long as the division can withdraw in case of
necessity .
78. Movement and traffic control will be carried out in accord-
20
I
._/
ance with the principles laid down in Movement and Traffic
ontrol.
79. The speed with which all troops of the division can catch up
permits large intervals between individual units and groups within
the march columns, provided the division is allotted roads with no
time limit. In this case, unified control of the march columns is
unnecessary. Individual units form at the times allotted them,
and are in turn given the order to move . By this means the commander
maintains control over movements of the division . If
the foremost elements of the columns are held up, units behind
are not necessarily held up in their turn . The different speeds of
movement in the division are compensated for . omplete march
columns may also be formed without previous assembly .
Large intervals between individual columns necessitate strict
traffic control in order to prevent other troops from mingling in the
movement of the division . If the higher command lays down
definite times during which the division is to use certain roads,
intervals between individual march columns must be so regulated
that the roads are cleared within the time allotted .
80. If sufficient roads are available, the advance will normally
be made in several columns, but if there is a possibility of contact
with the enemy, the lateral interval between march columns must
be such as to allow the division to concentrate swiftly for unified
employment .
81 . The intention of surprising the enemy, as well as the threat
of air attack, frequently makes night marches necessary . The
division will lay down the degree of lighting necessary .
Speed in night marches depends upon, visibility . When no
lights are used for driving, speed must be dictated by considerations
of safety. Road reconnaissance and clear signposting are
indispensable in night marches .
82. Liaison between the division commander and his tactical
group and the march columns, march groups or individual units
on the move must be insured by liaison officers, messengers, and
radio. Radio sections detached for this purpose listen in, even
during periods of radio silence .
It is desirable to establish points along the main route of
advance with which units moving on other roads can establish
timely liaison. Liaison over long distances can be established
21
by means of aircraft. They can also be employed to cover the
movement of the division and report the points reached by individual
columns . Within the march columns and march groups
liaison will be maintained by messengers .
83. Halts of 20 minutes should be made every 2 hours, or
when necessary . Unified divisional control of timing for the
individual march columns and march groups is essential . Within
a march column no commander may halt independently, even for
a short time, as each halt extends itself to the rear and causes
undesirable blockages and increased gasoline consumption .
A rest is essential under normal conditions after a 4- to 5-hour
movement. It conserves the gasoline supply and can be used
to give the drivers food and rest . It should last for at least 3
hours.
Rest areas must be reconnoitered in advance . They must
permit a rapid resumption of the advance . Rest areas for troops
on wheeled vehicles and motorcycle troops are generally close to
the road ; for tracked vehicles they are some distance from the
road.
84. Long marches make the same demands on vehicles of the
division as does battle itself . After 4 or 5 days' operations it is
essential, in order to maintain efficiency of the armored division,
that time be allotted for recovery and overhaul . If the situation
or military necessity forbid this, the commander must accept
the fact that parts of the division will be temporarily unfit for
service .
Frequently a rest of several hours will be sufficient to repair
damaged vehicles . Troops must be informed of the duration of
the rest period .
Section II
MAR H ORGANIZATION
85 . With the rapidly changing situation of the armored division,
there is no hard and fast rule for march organization . The command
must adjust march organization to suit a wide variety of
demands.
86. If combat is not expected during the march, wheeled, halfand
fully-tracked vehicles move together .
22
87 . If ce:aact with the enemy is expected during . .e march,
the controlling factors are the task, enemy resistance to be
expected, and the terrain .
88. At the same time, care must be taken to see that units are
allowed to overtake march columns only if the advance elements of
the column are halted in order to leave the road clear and all
traffic from the other direction is held up .
89. If the situation indicates that contact with the enemy will
require immediate employment of the tank brigade, the latter
must be placed well forward in the columns. If, on the other
hand, it can be seen from the situation or the nature of the ground
that tanks cannot be used on first contact with the enemy, then
the motorized infantry will lead . The tanks will follow, be given
a separate route, or will be kept in readiness off the road .
If the situation requires the division to be employed in task
forces, movement will be carried out in mixed march groups.
Their composition will be dictated by requirements of the impending
battle. An attempt should be made, even within mixed
march groups, to assign separate roads to tanks and to other arms .
This must, of course, depend upon the tactical situation and a
suitable road system which allows advance on a broad front .
If important sectors are to be occupied in advance of the
enemy or during pursuit, special mobile advance detachments
may be formed . They hurry on without regard to maintaining
contact with the division behind them . Their composition must
be such that they can quickly break any expected enemy resistance
and brush aside obstacles . Engineers must be allotted to these
detachments .
It may be advisable to place the recgnnaissance forces and
the advance units temporarily under the same command . This
must be ordered by the division .
90. The artillery must be well forward so that it will be prepared
for action .
Engineers are to be assigned to all march columns if special
tasks do not require the concentration of engineer forces .
91. ombat vehicles of all units will be divided into vehicles
which the troops require during action and those which are not apt
to be required immediately. The first group moves with units,
the second will follow either under control of commanders of the
23
march
co-,ns
or under unified control of the divisiG ..j .\,according
to the division commander's decision .
Section III
SE URITY ON THE MOVE
92 . The armored division protects itself against a ground enemy
by early initiation of ground and air reconnaissance .
93 . If early contact with the enemy is expected, the advance
will be covered by an advance guard . If the advance is made
along more than one road, each march column will be allotted an
advance guard .
Strength and composition of the advanced guard are dictated
by the situation, terrain visibility, and strength of the march
column. If the tank brigade follows immediately behind the advance
guard, the fighting strength of the latter may be kept relatively
small . In suitable country, the tank brigade, or part of it,
may take over the duties of advance guard in order to destroy
enemy resistance immediately . If considerable antitank opposition,
road blocks, or natural obstacles are apt to be encountered,

CONFERENCE HELD BY LT.-GENERAL G.G. SIMONDS CB,
CBE, DSO, GOC 2 CDN CORPS, AT MAIN HQ 2 CDN
CORPS, WIJCHEN, HOLLAND, 20 DEC 44.
(N.B.  This conference was attended by the Commanders and GSOs 1,
Divs, all Brigade Commanders, the Commander 2nd Cdn Armd Bde,
CCRA, Chief of Staff, CE, CSO, DA & QMG, AA & QMG, GSO 2 Ops,
GSO 2 Int, 2 Cdn Corps, OC, 2 Cdn Fd Hist Sec, LO from Army and a
senior representative from 30 Corps)  Hist Offr.
1. The GOC opened his remarks by stating that the purpose of the
meeting was to make a general review of the situation in North-Western
Europe, by going back over recent events and by discussing what is now
actually happening on the various Army fronts in this theatre. He would
also attempt to say something about the probabilities of the future operation
that has been planned which concerns this Corps directly and which in the
light of recent events may be postponed indefinitely.
2. Going back to earlier operations General Simonds stated that SHAEF
had considered that the main stay of our winter campaign would be the
capture of Antwerp and securing of the Scheldt Estuary to guarantee the
passage of our supply vessels without molestation from the enemy. In
considering whether or not a winter campaign would take place SHAEF had
to make two decisions. First, if there was to be a winter campaign, Antwerp
had to be cleared. Secondly, it had to be determined whether or not the
Germans would accept fighting the decisive battle of Germany on this side
of the Rhine. The answer to the first decision depended upon the clearing
of the enemy from the Scheldt and this task had been given to the First Cdn
Army and particularly to 2 Cdn Corps and we succeeded in clearing the
Scheldt as planned so that now at the present time the port facilities of
Antwerp are in use. The second decision was made by the Germans
themselves when the Americans broke through at Aachen and penetrated as
far as the Siegfried line to be stopped by determined resistance on the part
of the enemy.
3. On Saturday, 16 Dec 44, the enemy put in a strong counter-attack
against American forces between Durem and Trier and succeeded in
breaking through at a considerable rate. The attack was made along two
axis and the enemy apparently employed six Panzer divisions to achieve
this. The GOC then went into detail describing the enemy attack based on
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
170
171
the information to hand and showed how the enemy had concentrated
considerable striking force making full use of his best trained SS divisions.
Apparently the enemys objective was to strike through to get to the river
Meuse and then perhaps go Northwards towards Liege or Southwards
towards Namur. The GOC felt that by this evening they would reach the
line of the River Meuse by which time a strong American counter-force on
the Western bank of the Meuse would be there to seal off any further
progress on the part of the enemy. The GOC also stated that the Southern
part of the corridor effected by the enemy was sealed off and that the sealing
off of the Northern portion was virtually complete. Furthermore, General
Pattons Third US Army would strike from the South to near the entrance
to the corridor and thus cut off those of the enemy who had broken through.
General Simonds said that in effecting this breakthrough three US divisions
were very badly mauled and at the present time ceased to function as
divisions.
4. Commenting on this breakthrough, the GOC felt that never at any time
since the invasion is the situation more favourable for the Allies. The
enemy has shown his force and has declared himself as ready to take all in
this breakthrough. So far he has not succeeded in doing any real strategic
harm to the Allies there being no airfields in the areas which he has seized,
and judging from captured orders it would seem that they will depend
mainly upon captured American fuel and equipment to maintain the force
of their attack. The GOC pointed out that this was a rather precarious
method of mounting an attack of such major proportions.

CONFERENCE OF COMMANDER, 2 CDN CORPS, ON
OPERATION BLOCKBUSTER, HELD AT MAIN HQ
2 CDN CORPS, 22 FEB 45.
1. The Corps Commanders opening remarks were concerned with giving
the up-to-date enemy picture on the immediate Corps and flanking fronts.
He stated that the enemy had brought in what reserves he could during the
opening phases of Operation Veritable and two days ago (20 Feb) he
reached the stage of having to utilize divisional organizations with remnants
The Rhineland Battles and the Liberation of the Netherlands
of units tagged on to them. In other words, the enemy is putting in to battle
every reserve he can immediately lay his hands upon. On 23 Feb Operation
Grenade will commence, which is the IXth US Armys operation for
crossing the River Rhur.
2. The Corps Commander then stated that on 25 or 26 Feb 2 Cdn Corps
will undertake an operation to be known as Blockbuster with the object of
capturing the high ground south of Calcar and Udem and then to exploit to
the enemy positions towards Xanten and Wesel. For this operation 2 Cdn
Corps will have two fresh armoured divisions available, viz., 4 Cdn Armd
Div and 11 Brit Armd Div. General Simonds pointed out that seldom, if
ever, will such an opportunity present itself again wherein the Crops would
have available to it two fresh divisions. He said that rather than to dribble
in his fresh reserves he considered that now was the time to strike hard at
the enemy in an all-out effort. He pointed out that the enemy has managed
to achieve some semblance of organization in his defences due mainly to
the favourable lay-out of the high ground upon which he was falling and
also to the fact that as his bridgehead was being gradually curtailed the
ratio of his fire power for a given area increased tremendously.
In support of the operation, the Corps Commander said that all of 2 Cdn
Corps and 30 Brit Corps artillery, including 2 Cdn AGRA, will be available,
in addition to all available air support providing that the weather is
favourable. The Corps Commander pointed out that the nature of the
ground was important to the enemys ability to maintain his positions. He
said that Calcar will be fought for because it is a centre of a good roads
system and also that the high ground between Calcar and Udem holds the
main weight of enemy infantry defences. The principal anti-tank defences
consist of an anti-tank ditch running behind the infantry defences in a layback
position to the Hochwald Forest.
Plan
Phase I
(a) An attack by 2 Cdn Inf Div at H-Hour with two armoured
regiments (2 Cdn Armd Bde) moving at tank pace to secure the high ground
and escarpment south of Calcar. Main weight of attack by 6 Cdn Inf Bde,
with a support attack by a battalion of 5 Cdn Inf Bde to broaden the base.
At the conclusion of this phase 4 Cdn Inf Bde will have been pinched out.
(b) A subsidiary attack on the right by one battalion, 8 Cdn Inf
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
172
173
Bde with one armd sqd moving at infantry pace, at H-Hour, to get astride
road Calcar-Udem area 9845.
Phase II
(a) An attack on the right by two battalions of 8 Cdn Inf Bde (3
Cdn Inf Div) to capture line of road 970433 to incl Keppeln 9844.
(b) An attack (co-ordinated) by Corps with (a) by a battle group
(two inf bns, two armd regts) of 4 Cdn Armd Div to establish them on a line
excl Keppeln to road at 020450.
Phase III
(a) 3 Cdn Inf Div passes 9 Cdn Inf Bde through to the assault of
Udem.
(b) 4 Cdn Armd Div passes a battle group through to establish
itself on the high ground 1942  0043  0143.
(c) 2 Cdn Inf Div passes 4 Cdn Inf Bde through to relieve battle
group of 4 Cdn Armd Div on the position referred to in Phase II para (b).
(d) 11 Armd Div conforms to advance of 9 Cdn Inf Bde.
Phase IV
(a) While 3 Cdn Inf Div is fighting for Udem, 11 Armd Div will
by-pass Udem to the SW and advance on axis Udem-Sonsbeck 0535 and
high ground immediately NE of Sonsbeck leaving a firm base on
escarpment 0400  0039.
(b) 3 Cdn Inf Div will follow the advance of 11 Armd Div by
stepping up battalions by brigades along the line of the R Grosseley with
the object of eventually relieving 11 Armd Div of Sonsbeck.
(c) 4 Cdn Armd Div will advance (as ordered by Div Comd) to
establish a battle group astride the railway line 0340  0440.
(d) 2 Cdn Inf Div while retaining one brigade on the high ground
immediately south of Calcar, and one as referred in Phase III para (c), to
pass the third brigade through to relieve battle group of 4 Cdn Armd Div on
objective referred to in Phase II para (b).
Exploitation
No forecast possible but alternative as follows:

NOTES ON CONFERENCE HELD BY COMD 2 CDN CORPS
Lt. Gen G.G. Simonds, CB, CBE, DSO held a conference of comds down to
bn comds and SOs down to grade two appointments at the Winter Garden
Theatre Nijmegen 171030A at which he stressed the following pts.
1. Inf: That the standard of inf tactics had deteriorated due (a) to hy
wastage since beginning of op Overlord, (b) due to the unusual type of
fortress warfare which the Corps had undertaken during the autumn and (c)
to the static period during the winter of 1944-45. The result was that there
was too little imagination used in the emp of ap arms, too great a
dependence on sp weapons, and too little appreciation of the time factor in
battle. With the improved enemy method of handling his arty, fewer med
guns would be available for direct inf sp and the inf would have to rely on
fd arty. Too great a dependence upon sp weapons, e.g. Crocodiles, means
that the enemy by cratering rds and mining tk approaches can gain
sufficient time after having been forced off a tactical feature to reorg at
leisure upon a new one (he cited the op to clear the Hamerbruch feature and
the capture of Veen as examples of this). Junior leaders were not
sufficiently aware of the tactical advantage and the consequent chance of
saving lives involved in a quick follow up of a retreating enemy. Inf were
becoming too dependent on TCVs and he laid it down as a principle that inf
The Rhineland Battles and the Liberation of the Netherlands
175
should NOT be lifted for an adv of under 15 miles unless very tired, as the
time wasted in ordering fwd the vehs, onbussing and debussing, gave the
enemy a chance to org his def. He stressed the importance of keeping the
inf sec in battle down to 6 or 7 men with good trained men LOB; that the
inf sec in our army, unlike the American or Russian armies, is NOT a
tactical unit, and he discouraged the fmn of rifle and bren gps within the sec
as tending to destroy the efficiency of the real tactical unit, the pl; by
keeping an efficient number of mne LOB, it prevented the bn from suffering
crippling cas in a set piece attack and enabled it to reinforce itself without
having to pause. He stressed that future ops would contain a great deal of
wood fighting and street fighting whose whole success depends upon the
standard of trg of the pl and sec comd.
2. Arty: Owing to the increased efficiency with which the enemy is now
org his arty and mortar DF, more med guns will have to be allotted for CB
and will NOT normally be available in sp of inf except for engaging SP
guns, tks or fortress posns. Our arty preparation and methods are becoming
too standardized and well known to the enemy. He asked for study of the
question of using a block barrage instead of a creeping barrage. By
neutralizing an area in depth, and lifting, say 500 yds every 15 mins, it (a)
enabled the inf to mop up and thoroughly clear an area without loosing the
barrage and (b) gave the enemy less chance of discovering exactly where
our own inf were and then putting down mortar cones behind the barrage.
FOOs must be prepared to accompany the inf on foot either manhandling
their wrls set or using aslt line.
3. Comns: Units were to apt to rely on wrls and NOT to make use of the
lines and runners.
4. Comd: Aconfusion existed between a unit or fmn in res and one at rest.
At the beginning of an attack, the freshest and most battle worthy unit
should be in res, since the units which make the initial penetration are
working to a fixed plan, whereas when the res unit passes through, it has
NO exact infm about the enemy and will have to improvise.

ANNEX A
An Army that can Attack  A
Division that can Defend
By Captain G.G. Simonds
Royal Canadian Artillery
Canadian Defence Quarterly, Vol. XV, No. 4, July 1938
Introductory
In an article in the April 1938 issue of Canadian Defence Quarterly, Lt.-
Col. E.L.M. Burns, O.B.E., M.C., suggests a reorganization of the infantry
division to produce A Division That Can Attack. Many of the detailed
conclusions reached by Col. Burns are open to dispute but it is not intended to
enter into a discussion of them here  the present writer proposes to join issue on
broader lines. Before we proceed to the design stage whether we are building a
house, a ship or a fighting formation it is good and established practice to lay
down a specification for performance based upon the functions which it is
desired that the finished article shall fulfill. Col. Burns ignores the specification
stage and plunges into the design stage, the reorganization of the line of
battle division, on the assumption that we require a division capable of taking the
offensive under its own steam. Because he has ignored what is probably the
most vital stage in the production of any article, in the opinion of the present
writer, he has laboured and brought forth the unwanted brain-child  A division
that can attack.
Col. Burns makes it clear that the division which he considers suitable for
the British Army, and as a prototype for the Empire, is designed primarily for a
national war  a war of the first magnitude against a first class power or
combination of powers. Without entering into a discussion on the views on
foreign policy of Great Britain and the Dominions, it is sufficient to point out that
if Canada is called upon to defend herself, either directly or indirectly, it will be
against aggression by a first class power. War organization for such a contingency
is that in which Canada is most interested and the present writer offers no apology
for further discussion of the subject. The subject is discussed in relation to Great
Britain because, firstly it is to the British Army that Col. Burns offers his division
and secondly because the military problems of Great Britain are more concrete
than our own.
It is proposed to study the functions of the line of battle division (or
what we have been used to call the infantry division) under the following
headings:-
(a) The British Army in a national war.
(b) The Offensive Battle.
(c) The Defensive Battle.
The writer believes that having studied the problem under the above headings we
will reach the conclusion that what is required is An Army that can Attack  A
Division that can Defend.
The British Army in a National War
If Great Britain is involved in a European war there will be no question of
a limited liability  she will be fighting for her existence. If Great Britain and
her allies are to gain a decision against a continental combine, that decision must
be gained on land  the hostile armies must be rendered incapable of further
action. Naval and air forces may make an even greater contribution towards
victory than they have done in the past, but the coup-de-grace will have to be
delivered by land forces  by an army. To what extent Great Britain will
contribute to an army on the continent will depend upon events. But apart from
any continental contribution, she will have many purely defensive commitments
to ensure the safety of her sea and air communications.
Some military experts argue the superiority of a small, highly trained
hard-hitting force over the unwieldy, cumbrous masses of continental armies 
the superiority of the nimble David over the sluggish Goliath. The theory is
attractive if Goliath will play his part true to form. But the unwieldy, cumbrous
masses may turn out to be a large, highly trained, hard-hitting force and the
good featherweight usually makes poor sport when matched against the equally
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
178
good heavyweight. If the armies of Great Britains continental allies are faced
with defeat, if they are incapable of gaining a victory by themselves, then much as
the British people may dislike continental warfare, they must either fight on the
continent or accept defeat or stalemate. A study of the records of discussions
between British and French soldiers and statesmen in 1917 and 1918, on the
subject of manpower, should be sufficient to convince anyone, that in a
partnership we make war as we must and not as we should like to.
The size of the army which Great Britain will place on the continent of
Europe cannot be set at an arbitrary figure. It will be determined by the force
required in conjunction with allied forces, to ensure victory. It is conceivable,
having regard to the size of the British Regular Army and possible commitments
elsewhere, that the initial contribution on the continent may be nothing more than
a token force. If all goes well with the armies of her allies it may remain so for
the duration of the war  Britains share in an allied victory taking the form of
action on the sea and in the air. On the contrary, it may become necessary at once
to reinforce the first flight to stop the first onrush and slave off defeat  the
primary role of such reinforcing elements being defence. It is well within the
bounds of possibility that ultimately to ensure victory, the British Army on the
continent may represent the maximum effort of Great Britain (and those
Dominions which may decide to assist her) bearing in mind the needs of the navy,
the air force, overseas commitments and the home industries required to maintain
the nation in arms.
Certain exponents of mechanized warfare seem to be of the opinion that when it
comes to producing armoured fighting vehicles the capacity of British industry is
unlimited. Judging by the fact that Great Britain is purchasing abroad, the
demands of the present rearmament programme have already stretched British
industry beyond its capacity. Realizing that in the present case it has had to start
from scratch, this industry must support in war, the navy, the air force, the army
and an export trade to maintain foreign credits for purchase of raw materials. It is
unfortunately a fact that the offensive weapons are the most difficult to produce
and most expensive to maintain. Weapons of offence for a British Army will not
be available in unlimited quantities.
If the foregoing arguments are accepted the following conclusions may be
drawn:-
(a) In a national war, the British Army will have many
purely defensive commitments.
(b) Once again the British Army may have to expand to
provide a great army on the continent of Europe.
179
An Army that can AttackA Division that can Defend
(c) The offensive material which British industry can
supply to and maintain for the Army will be limited. There will
not be enough to squander it on troops required for a purely
defensive role, and as a corollary to the above:-
(d) Under these circumstances it is not logical to design the
basic formation of the British Army as a whole for offensive
action.
It remains to be seen whether the basic formation of that part of the British Army
which fights on the continent of Europe should be a division that can attack.
The Offensive Battle
From Col. Burns article one might deduce that, if every division must be
capable of attack, the future British Commander-in-chief is going to revert to that
unhappy policy of 1916-17  being offensive everywhere and all the time. Let us
hope there is no repetition of a policy so wasteful of effort and barren of results.
Assuming that the initiative rests with the British, ground alone will limit the areas
in which a sustained offensive will be practicable.1 There will be areas unsuitable
for a British offensive but perhaps well adapted to the mounting of a hostile
offensive directed against them. There will be areas in which the ground is such
that large scale offensives will be impractical for both sides. Such areas must be
held in varying degrees of strength  but must they be held by divisions that can
attack? The offensive weapons  the hitting-power  of a British Army will be
limited. The bulk of this hitting power should be at the disposal of the highest
commander who can control the battle  not arbitrarily divided between divisions
in penny packets. Once the requirements of security have been met, for the
Commander-in-Chiefs main offensive, intended to be the decisive coup-de-grace,
every ounce of hitting power should be concentrated. A Meggido, a Riga or a
Caporetto can only be planned for an army in which the Commander-in-Chief
controls the punch. When G.H.Q. exercises only general direction and the
control of the battle is in the hands of forward formation commanders then the
hitting power must be decentralized to enable leading formations to fight their
own way forward. Thus for the approach march or broken battle leading
divisions, or even brigades, must be strengthened by the offensive elements
necessary to make them divisions (or brigades) that can attack. But the
organization within the army must be such, that for the main offensive battle a
highly centralized control may be exercised over those elements upon which the
success of the operation depends.
If the foregoing arguments are accepted the following conclusions may be
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
180
181
An Army that can AttackA Division that can Defend
drawn:-
(a) Even for the side which holds the initiative there will be
many holding tasks during offensive operations. The
minimum strength for a basic formation must be a division that
can hold.
(b) The offensive power of an army should be at the
disposal of the highest commander who can actually influence
the battle. This will vary with every phase of operations. The
bulk of the offensive elements of an army should be so
organized that either a centralized or decentralized control may
be exercised.
(c) For the main offensive, the bulk of available hitting
power should be at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief to
allot in accordance with his plan and in proportion to the
importance he attaches to the various phases of his attack or
attacks.
(d) A basic division that can hold is a suitable element for
an offensive army providing that there is a G.H.Q. or higher
formation pool from which the offensive elements may be
attached to it when it is required to attack.
(e) Owing to the difficulties of terrain alone, offensive
operations will only be possible on part of a battle front. Only a
proportion of divisions will need the additional strength to make
them divisions that can attack.
(f) A division organized to hold should not be asked nor
expected to attack without the addition of offensive elements.
The Defensive Battle
For an army fighting a defensive battle, the sectors of the front which it
holds will vary in importance. There will be sectors where a successful hostile
offensive may strike at an objective or objectives vital to the defence. The
Flanders sector, covering the Channel Ports, held by the British Armies in the
Spring of 1918 affords an example. Such a sector must be fully insured and
formations holding it must be capable of large scale counter-attacks. There may
be sectors where the defence can give ground  forcing the enemy to pay a price
for every advance, but slipping out of reach of the set piece hammer before it
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
182
falls. The sector held by the Fifth Army in March 1918 and the action which
G.H.Q. visualized on the part of the Fifth Army2 represented this type of defence.
When opportunities exist for tactics of this nature counter-attacks should be
limited to small scale operations organized by units in contact with the enemy, if
the latter are caught off balance  they will not demand a high degree of offensive
power from the formations operating. There will be sectors in which a sustained
offensive by the enemy will be impractical but through which the enemy might
infiltrate if they were not held. Formations defending sectors of this type require
holding power only. There may be sectors where it is intended to give ground
to lead the enemy into a trap for the main counter-offensive.
The task of the division in defence may vary from preventing infiltration
through a quiet sector, to holding a sector where the loss of its position may
seriously embarrass the defence. It may have a counter-attack role on a vital part
of the front or may form part of the general reserve, held to deliver the main
counter-offensive. It must be able to hold. The extent to which it will be required
to attack will vary with the task allotted to it. It is only the Commander-in-Chief
who, viewing the battlefield as a whole, knows the importance attached to each
sector, to the holding of certain ground and to the success of his counter-offensive.
The bulk of the offensive power should be under his control to allot to his
formations in accordance with the importance which he attaches to their tasks.
From the above arguments the following conclusions may be drawn:-
(a) The basic formation for defence should be a division
that can hold.
(b) The bulk of offensive elements should be at the disposal
of the Commander-in-Chief to sub-allot in accordance with his
plan.
(c) Divisions required to counter-attack on any but a very
small scale must be strengthened by the attachment of additional
offensive resources.
General Conclusions
In the opinion of the present writer the British Division is not a division
that can attack. It is also his opinion that this is not because of obtuseness nor
stupidity on the part of its designers. It is because both in attack and defence there
will be many holding tasks, because in spite of reckless estimates, the main
offensive weapons will be limited and because the offensive weapons must be kept
flexible and capable of the most advantageous distribution to meet the varying
An Army that can AttackA Division that can Defend
183
conditions of battle. Some additional offensive strength may be permanently
allotted to corps. But a Division that can attack is not wanted and can only be
created by violating the principle of economy of force.
An army, no matter what its size must be an army that can attack. Its basic
formation can be a Division that can defend providing that within the army as a
whole there exists offensive power proportionate to the administrative strain
which the maintenance of that army in the field entails. It is mainly by the skilful
handling and distribution of his offensive elements that the Commander-in-Chief
justifies his existence.
ENDNOTES
1. The German appreciations for the Spring offensive of 1918 are excellent
in regard to their arguments as to what does and what does not constitute an
offensive front.
2. That the tactics of the Fifth Army differed from the action visualized by
G.H.Q. does not affect this argument.

02 Whether or not the turning movement can be ini tiated prior to the contact of other friendly forces with the main enemy forces will depend on many factors Whenever possible the forces engaged in the turning movement should be from those not in contact with hostile forces when the maneuver is begun It is preferable to begin the turning movement from an area well to the flank and strike the hostile rear vital areas with surprise disrupt the hostile high command and assist in completing the total defeat of the enemy There can be no formulas as to the area from which the turning movement is begun nor the area to which it Is directed In one situation the friendly forces may be within mutually supporting distance (modern means of trans- portation have greatly Increased this distance) ; In another the turning movement may consist of operations both by land air and water to gain the hostile rear areas or areas otherwise vital to the prosecution of war by the enemy m 03 The successful turning movement presages great stra- tegic and tactical victory However the commander must give consideration to certain dangers inherent In this ma- neuver The commander of the turning forces will ordinarily be given a general directive for operation's ; Therefore the possibility always exists that the turning forces will turn too soon or too close to the main hostile forces find themselves confronted by a defended enemy front and be forced into a frontal attack or a change in direction of movement with the probable resulting delay As a consequence of the great distance separating the friendly forces there may be the risk of defeat in detail

maneuver and the possible hostile reactions The separate
forces must be strong enough to execute their missions without
assistance from the other Each must be capable of fully
exploiting a success gained by the other The elements allotted
the commander of the turning movement should be
strong in highly mobile hard-striking forces These must
be reinforced with powerful combat aviation means and
plentifully provided with suitable reconnaissance agencies
both ground and air The commander to whom is entrusted
the execution of the turning movement must be bold and
aggressive He must be one who having weighed carefully
the factors of the situation daringly puts his decision into
execution He must give full play to his initiative and be able
quickly to exploit successes or turn seeming disadvantages
into situations favorable to himself
STRATEGIC WITHDRAWAL AND COUNTEROFFENSIVE
i 05 It cannot be expected that advances along the entire
front of the armies on the offensive will be uniform Successes
will be notable on some parts of the front ; inability to advance
will be common on others ; reverses also must be expected
These varying degrees of success stalemate and reverse provide
the energetic bold commander opportunities to exploit
situations which seem unfavorable to him and favorable to
the enemy and thus achieve results of decisive importance
Under such conditions the higher commander may direct a
withdrawal where a stalemate has resulted or where he is
experiencing reverses and follow this withdrawal with a
counteroffensive to envelop and encircle the pursuing hostile
forces Boldly conceived carefully planned and energetically
executed this maneuver may bring decisive results
3 06 In the execution of the counteroffensive from a withdrawal
for the purpose of enveloping and encircling the hostile
forces certain fundamental doctrines are applicable :
a The withdrawing forces preferably should withdraw from
an area whose recapture is important to the enemy
b Terrain preferably en both flanks of the withdrawing
force should permit the flanks of the withdrawing elements
to be held and protecte u Behind these protected flanks

C Adequate mobile reserves are required for the rapid con- centration of forces necessary to accomplish the enclrclement Armored and motorized divisions are particularly Suited for this component of the counteroffensive These reserves should be moved secretly ordinarily at night Secret move- ment by day requires absolute air superiority in the area of movement The requirements of deception may not make this air superiority desirable In the area of withdrawal d The conduct of such an operation requires the most care- ful planning a highly trained and disciplined command and great initiative in all ranks e During the withdrawal and particularly just prior to the launching of the counteroffensive the withdrawing forces must be aggressive They must force the opposing com- mander to focus all 'or certainly most of his attention on the situation in front Local counterattacks and strong covering force action characterize this maneuver I When the counteroffensive is launched a strong frontal attack is combined with the attack of the encircling forces so directed as to ""wrap up"" the opposing forces and destroy or capture them
SECTION II
DEFENSIVE MANEUVER
GENERAL
0 07 Various factors may dictate the adoption of the strate- gic defensive in one or all areas at the opening of hostilities Included among these factors are the superior readiness of the enemy; inferior strategic position such as frontiers ex- posed on the flank ; inferior combat strength in one or more theaters ; or the advisability of deliberately adopting a de- fensive attitude initially to let the enemy expose his plans and commit himself
â 08 The strategic defensive confers some advantages in- itially on the nation or force which must gain time in order fully to mobilize its effort for offensive action The defender

will not have long lines of communication in hostile territory
to protect nor large hostile populations to control Where
time and space permit the defender may trade terrain for
the time necessary for the full mobilization of his offensive
power However for psychological reasons not only the
troops but the civilian population must be informed of and
impressed with the conception that such losses are temporary
only The commander has a responsibility to the nation as
a whole A nation correctly oriented as to the aims and requirements
of the military forces can be expected to and
will give its utmost to support the action of its armed forces
The strategic defensive ably conducted and appropriately
employing the tactical offensive will permit the field commander
to assemble his forces as they become ready By assembling
in such areas and at such times as to permit him to
take full advantage of enemy mistakes and move decisively
to the offensive he will be able to defeat the enemy's armed
forces and break the will of the hostile state to continue operations
The execution of such maneuvers requires that the
higher commander possess the highest qualities of leadership
that he be decisive and of adamant will power with the
ability to select the correct time for offensive operations and
that all forces be thoroughly indoctrinated with the fundamental
consideration that only by the offensive can decisive
results be achieved
0 08 Although conditions may require the adoption of the
strategic defensive initially the fundamental consideration
remains that no decisive results can be achieved by the deferl-
The power of initiative over-all threat and the ability
to strike at the tactical or strategic area of his choosing remains
with the higher commander who is on the offensive
It is he who forces his opponent to conform to and seek to
parry his movements

A Whether the defensive will be conducted initially with the intention of holding a general area and offering decisive battle In this area or of executing delaying or retiring ma- neuvers will depend on many factors Among these are the time during which it is estimated the defensive attitude must be maintained ; the space in which the defender can ma- neuver without engaging in decisive battle ; the necessity of protecting vital strategic areas such as essential Industries mines or other sources of raw material ; and the terrain on or near the boundary between the two States as well as that farther within the boundary Whatever the character of the defensive maneuver decided upon it must be predicated upon

N 2 It must be expected that an opponent strong in ar- mored means will seek to use this means to strike deep into the defender's rear (See pars 83 to 92 incl ) It is on roads that armored units can achieve greatest speed In many situations terrain and weather conditions may limit rapid movement of armored and motorized formations to roads It is therefore imperative that the commander give careful
44
consideration to and make adequate provision for suitable
antitank defense measures along all roads in rear of his
forward elements and in great depth on those roads Not
only can highly mobile enemy elements
iwhich
succeed t n
breaking through or enveloping a Position
and frequently make his position untenable but
unless they are blocked or delayed these elements may be
able to disrupt the orderly withdrawal or retirement of the
friendly forces Where time and facilities permit the antitank
defenses along roads in rear areas can be provided by
prepared installations This permits the commander to retain
his mobile elements for active offensive employment as
the situation dictates Tank-destroyer units provide the
commander hard-striking highly mobile means which should
be employed aggressively to seek out and destroy enemy
armored formations
DEFENSIVE IN ONE POSITION
i 3 When strategic considerations cause the high commander
to decide to execute his defensive mission in one
position the selection of the area for this position is his
next major strategic decision This decision will be influenced
by the factors which have been considered In F""v
00-5 under tactical operations of the defense and by the
necessity of protecting vital installations or areas Whether
the force engaged be an army corps or the entire field forces
of the nation the position must be such that the enemy
cannot risk passing the defender without offering battle
On the other hand the defender must not take a p
sit of
which will permit his forces to be contained by a p
the enemy forces while the remainder advance with slight
opposition to decisive objectives The flanks of the position
must be protected Where other conditions permit they are
rested on difcult obstacles

must be organized to or it may be the culmination of maneuver block hostlle moves Under either condition it is of the utmost importagce that the mobility of the defending forces be such that hostile Successes in one area can be effectively met by elements from other areas It is the essence o/ the defense that the enemy be prevented from exploiting his initial success; and of the strategic de/ease that it can at the proper time and place launch a decisive counteroffensive 5 Factors indicative of or favoring the defensive in one position include the following : a Early arrival of reinforcements b Terrain the defensive power of which greatly augments the combat strength of the defender c Short distance Of the enemy from decisive strategic objectives
d Location of a position on the flank of the enemy advance which will force him to change direction and commit his forces in a maneuver less favorable to him e Strong natural or prepared flanks which cannot be turned or which will require long tedious operations to turn 6 Although the commander may plan to hold on one position until he can launch the offensive he must be pre- pared to meet enemy successes Rear positions must be reconnoitered and prepared Under suitable conditions on a part of the front he may execute a strategic withdrawal to these positions and follow by a decisive counteroffensive (See pars 05 and 06 )
i 7 Not only must the commander assure himself that suitable defensive measures are taken aga(nst hostile ground forces but also must be especially vigilant to defeat attacks against his rear by parachute troops and other troops traps ported by air or water (See FM 00-5 )
RETROGRADE DEFENSIVE
8 The retrograde defensive avoids decisive battle until adequate measures can be effected for the successful assump- tion of the offensive It delays the enemy draws'him farther from his major supply bases and elongates his lines of corn-
46
LARGER UNITS 8- 2
munication ; it inflicts losses by offensive tactical operations
and disrupts his plans by the operations of detachments in
his rear The retrograde defensive in one area may be
combined with the offensive in another area This combination
of maneuver finds special application when it will operate
to draw component elements of the hostile force away from
each other The retrograde defensive is suitable when time
and space factors are favorable and the initial loss of terrain
will be more than compensated by the reasonable expectation
of subsequent decisive results Tactical considerations affecting
the conduct of retrograde actions are discussed in
FM 00-5
Â® 9 Inherent in the retrograde defensive are the dangers
that the defending forces will become involved in a decisive
engagement at an unfavorable time For instance the enemy
may strike while a withdrawal or retirement is in progress
or the actions of subordinate commanders may precipitate
a major engagement urematurely The essence of this
maneuver is to cause the opponent to prepare for a series
of battles not one of which the defender permits to reach
culmination until the decsisive moment arrives
V 20 Whether the retrograde defensive is initiated prior to
or following close contact the general situation the lines
of communication net the operations planned for the future
and the location of strategically important areas will largely
influence the commander's decision as to the direction of
movement to be taken by his subordinate elements They
may be directed to move straight to the rear or they may be
directed to converge on a given area ; or the convergence may
follow after a series of moves straight to the rear Under
any condition control of the entire force must be such that
at the proper time a concentration of forces may be effected
and launched in a decisive counterblow Throughout the
defensive action suitable reserves must be available to prevent
an enemy break-through or exploitation of local enemy
successes
M 2 The retirement straight to the rear simplifies execution
of the maneuver; it permits the maximum use of road
and rail nets ; it confronts the enemy on a broad front whose

â¢ ROLE The role of the Armored Force and its components
is the conduct of highly mobile ground warfare primarily
offensive in character by self-sustaining units of great
power and mobility composed of specially equipped troops
of the required arms and services Combat elements of the
Armored Force operate in close cooperation with combat aviation
and with large units of ground troops in the accomplishment
of a mission
â¢ 2 TACTICAL ORGANIZATION -a The Armored Force consists
of armored corps armored divisions and GHQ reserve tank
battalions It is composed of troops from more than one arm
or service transported in armored or other type motor
vehicles
b The amored corps consists of a headquarters and headquarters
company two or more armored divisions and certain
organic and auxiliary units termed corps troops
c The armored division is a self-contained unit of the several
arms and services organized tactically and administratively
for independent action It may be attached for
operation with an infantry or a cavalry corps

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
e The GHQ reserve battalions are self-contained units of
either light or medium tanks organized tactically and administratively
for employment by battalion or by group to furnish
additional striking power to other ground forces including
r mored divisions and corps Trained as units they are immediately
adaptable to inclusion in larger groupings of other
ground troops
â 3 CHARACTERISTICS -The characteristics of Armored Force
units are :
a Mobility -All combat units are mounted in armored
motor vehicles
b Fire power -Through a multiplicity of weapons mounted
on the vehicles
c Armor protection -All combat vehicles are protected by
armor of varying thickness capable of withstanding at least
rifle fire
d Shock action -Accomplished by the combination of the
other characteristics and by the weight and crushing power
of the major vehicles
0 4 METHODS OF EMPLOYING ELEMENTS OF ARMORED FORCEOperations
of components of the Armored Force may at
various times or simultaneously involvea
The attachment of GHQ tank battalions and groups to
infantry cavalry and armored divisions or corps
b The grouping of armored divisions corps or GHQ tank
groups with other corps or field armies for combined
operations
c The employment by the field or theater commander of
armored divisions and corps on independent or semiindependent
missions without reinforcing logistical means or
additional supporting troops other than combat and reconnaissance
'aviation
d Operation as task forces wherein armored divisions or
corps or at times GHQ reserve tank units are teamed with
motorized divisions antitank battalions antiaircraft 'automatic
weapons battalions and GHQ engineer maintenance
and supply units closely supported by combat aviation parachute
and other troops transported by air

Force properly utilized either separately or in combination

TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
with other means can achieve rapid decisive results in the
area of employment They are to be employed on decisive
missions They must not be frittered away on unimportant
objectives A mission far in advance of other main forces is
justified when the operation will obtain decisive results but
must be closely supported by other equally mobile troops
Their proper utilization necessitates a definite appreciation
and a careful consideration of the several characteristics of
the Armored Force units
a The conditions which should exist or be created for their
successful action are air superiority in the decisive area of
employment surprise favorable terrain and absence of or
neutralization of massed defensive means
b The mobility of armored units permits great latitude in
the choice of direction and the method of attack The decision
as to whether the attack will be executed as a turning
movement envelopment or penetration will be determined
largely by the time factor involved by the terrain and by
the hostile dispositions including hostile rear installations
The most suitable areas for the employment of Armored Force
units are on the open flanks or through existing gaps created
by penetrations of the enemy's positions
c The assignment of missions or objectives to armored
units must be preceded by a careful consideration of the more
important factors which affect the operation of the armored
and other units associated in the operations These factors
are : weather terrain throughout the entire area of contemplated
operation nature of the enemy and his methods of
combat availability of other supporting troops and especially
adequate space and road net for the operation of the units
concerned The axis of advance of the major armored and
motorized units will be along roads
d The most decisive results will be gained from the grouping
of overpowering masses of armored units and launching
them against vital objectives deep in the hostile rear The
armored mass must be supported by sufficient means to maintain
its momentum until the objective has been attained
e The most effective and decisive application of the mobility
and power of large armored and motorized combinations
will often necessitate the decentralization of control to
the appropriate commanders who will be guided only by the
broad general plan of the higher headquarters After the

initiation of the operation however the superior commander
must keep the armored unit commanders constantly informed
of the situation
f The maximum development of the demoralizing power
of the larger armored formations will be dependent in a large
measure on the continuous support of adequate reconnaissance
and observation aviation and timely assistance of combat
aviation in overcoming critical ground resistance beyond the
ability of available artillery This should be assured by direct
arrangement between air and armored unit commanders and
by adequate air-ground signal communication nets Higher
commanders can enhance the effectiveness of supporting
aviation by habitually assigning the same air and ground units
to work together as a task force or team
g The sustained mobility of armored and motorized units
is dependent upon adequate timely replenishment of required
supplies especially fuel and to a lesser degree oil and lubricants
Regular vehicle maintenance must be continued
When operations are to be prolonged for several days it must
be appreciated that armored and motorized units must have
opportunity for daily maintenance
h Because of their mass employment armored and motorized
units are difficult to conceal during approach and development
Elaborate measures for deception and surprise will be
required often and may involve variously : advance stockage
and concealment of essential supplies ; improvising and concentrating
dummy armored vehicles or marked activity of
actual units in localities distant from that of contemplated
employment ; extensive camouflage work ; and rapid shifting
ci armored masses to the area of decisive attack
d 6 A TAsx FORCE -A task force is a temporary tactical
grouping composed of one or more arms or services formed
for a specific mission or operation The operation of large
armored formations will frequently dictate the organization
of task forces The composition of such forces will be decided

unusualnumbers of tank units in a given area is an indication ofa probable major operation in that vicinity The concealment of vehicles therefore is important at all times particularly from aerial observation and photography Partialconcealment is of little or no value Every practicable effortmust be made to provide complete concealmentb Camouflage is work done to provide concealment ofmateriel troops or military works from enemy air or groundobservers To be effective camouflage must be supervised bypersonnel thoroughly familiar with its principles and methodsThe means employed are nets paulins paint earth branchesand grass The fundamental rules of camouflage are coveredin detail in FM 5-20 and 2 -45c Personnel of armored units must be thoroughly instructed in the use of natural means of camouflage availableand be required to apply habitually these means to concealthemselves and vehiclesd The following rules governing concealment should b ;known and understood by all :( ) Natural concealment should be sought before resortingto camouflage ; it is simpler requires less time skill andmaterial and is more effective Concealment of bivouacsis much simpler in woods and villages than in the openVehicles are best concealed by placing them under heavynatural cover as in dense woods In partly open country 277		27ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUALtothey should be driven into thin woods or clumps of trees orbrush(2) Camouflage should not be overdone A small amountof material judiciously employed is frequently more effectivethan a mass of material Branches of trees brush weedsleaves grass or dirt are usually available to cover tents andvehicles that are partially or wholly exposed Irregularpatches of different material are better than solid blanketsof any one kind(3) The worst enemies of concealment are straight linesregularity of pattern angles and shadows * Therefore ingenuity must be exercised to change or break the outline orregularity of the pattern of the object being camouflagedShelter tents in bivouacs and vehicles in parks or assemblyareas should always be placed in scattered irregular formations(4) An aerial observer cannot see an object within ashadow ; neither will an aerial photograph of the localityreveal it Even a partial shadow crossing the object makesrecognition difficult from the air Therefore natural concealment can be obtained by halting vehicles within shadows(5) Care should be taken that track imprints do notdisclose the location of vehicles Tracks may be obliteratedby covering them with brush leaves or dirt or by draggingover them with branches or some other means The enemymay be further deceived by running one or more vehiclesbeyond the true entrance to the area and obliterating theactual entrance In entering woods fewer tracks will haveto be obliterated if vehicles enter in column and scatter aftergetting under cover Also in dense woods care should betaken not to knock down any more trees than absolutelynecessary and then straighten up those that have beenknocked down(6) Making paths within bivouac to concealed vehiclesshould be avoided unless such paths are concealed from airobservation(7) When foliage is used to cover vehicles and other equipment it should be renewed daily Wilted leaves andbranches will appear different in color from natural surroundings when observed or photographed from the airCare should also be taken in gathering natural camouflageto avoid denuding the ground in the immediate vicinity of8TACTICS AND TECHNIQUEi27the object being camouflaged Fresh dirt should be covered with brush leaves or grass(8) No rubbish of any kind should be allowed to accumulate about a bivouac(9) Fire or smoke should not be permitted near vehicles( 0) Ruins provide one of the best means of concealment( ) At night necessary lights are concealed( 2) If natural concealment is not available vehicleshalted in the open should seek very broken ground folds inthe ground etc Natural or artificial means available shouldbe used to disguise their characteristic profile( 3) Bright or shining parts of material should be covered with mud or greasee Concealment in snow is much more difficult than atother times The following points should be kept in mind :Trails get tracked with mud and melt out early leaving ablack line ; snow falls through camouflage material and theholes show dark ; the heat of engines and of kitchen rangescause early melting of snow This can be remedied by keeping activity at a minimum when snow first falls ; and bycovering trails vehicles etcâ with fresh snow replacing itas often as neededf The noise of running engines particularly those oftanks can be heard at a considerable distance and will disclose the presence of concealed tanks to ground observersEngines therefore should always be stopped as soon as vehicles have been placed under cover or concealed Thisshould likewise be done whenever practicable as a meansof conserving fuelg The following precautions should be observed whilemoving to attack or in close proximity to the enemy :( ) Use all available natural cover whether stationary ormoving(2) Halt preferably under trees in thickets or in theshadow of buildings or trees(3) Choose routes of approach which provide the mostcover and concealment such as ravines draws gulleys orfolds in the ground ; avoid skylines(4) Avoid bottoms where vehicles may be bogged downand clumps of bushes where sink holes stumps etc may beencountered(5) Avoid dense woods ; travel along the edges9	ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUALTACTICS AND

"This point will be brought home more clearly when it is realized for
example that in the past two years the lst Armored Division alone has had approximately
.34,000 battle and nonbattle casualties although its original strength was
approximately 13,000 . This illustrates the -immense turnover and change in personnel
. A division that is on the firing line is always more or less a new division,
and after a heavy campaign its battle efficiency is probably not as good as a
division in the States with all of its original trainad men present, except from
the standpoint of battle experience in the surviving members of the combat division .
11. Tanks
The war has proven the soundness of the principles taught by the Ainore :i!
Force, and although many people were skeptical about the use of tanks, the tank ha-;
already proven itself a necessity and a bulwark on the battlefield, and in days
to come its importance will be increased with better opera',-rig terrain avail abla ._
Unfortunately, in the Italian c;..,:paign the terrain rind climate were such
n to restrict the use of tanks tremendousiy, but even in th-.a t campaign it was ':he
taa(c that made the breakthrough out of the Anzio Beachhead . It was the tank that
assisted the advance of the infantry and the advance to join the southern force
with the beachhead forces . Again it was the tank that bore the brunt of the push
from Rome to the Arno River. The tank, however, is not an instrmient alone. It -
must be closely supported by infantry and artillery . The tank was designed to take t
brunt of battle from the infantry . Our tankers can be trained with the offen_si-re
spirit to lead. the infantry in the attack . if the tnk does not do this, it has
not justified its existence . It's a well known statistical fact that although
losses may be heavy in tanks, the losses to the personnel of tanks is relatively
light, averaging about one and a fraction man per crew, and of these losses only
a small part are fatal. Our tankers have learned to be alert, to observe carefully
the foreground, and to go from one deÂ£il .â¢ded position to another with speed
and assurance . Tankers need not bo afraid of Â±ille :~f fir and develop confi;'
Zence in passing through heavy concentration â¢ of a~ til7 .er,;- after - they receive
negligible losses therefrom .
Tanks can operate in much rougher country than was formerly thought
?ossible . Field Iiarshal von Kesselring, the German Commander in Italy, paid a
greet tribute to our tanks w'icn he stated that ffmerican tanLrs went through country
thoug t impossible for tank operation an, which had not, therefore, been properly
17
defended against them. He also stated that our tank-infantry-artillery teamwork
in breaking out of the beachhead was a flawless example of attention to every
detail .
The greatest. single_. attribute of a tanker is to shoot accurately and _
with speed. The next is the spirit to continu all y bore in; however, roan doll
and-with hi$--eyes-wide-_ open _to : observe every possible point S â¢.he-e the enemy-,could
be concealed . All suspicious points should be shot at, and although the tanker may
iiot -'see'any enemy, the spraying of the ground in front with machine gun fire and
the sending of a round of 75 ammunition into every suspicious bush, outhouse,
haystack, or other point of natural cover upsets the defenders who do not know
whether they have been located or not but who consider that they have been since
fire is coming in their direction .
The tanks can make a path through hostile wire and antipersonnal mine
fields through which the infantry can pass without casualty . The infantry, on the
other hand, can spot antitank guns and concealed enemy tanks and thus greatly assist
the tanker.
In the pursuit north of Rome it was practice to carry infantry on the
backs of the tanks, and when the tanks came to turns in the mountain roads, the
infantry would dismount and reconnoiter around the turn to discover the presence
of antitank guns or hostile tanks . Many tanks and guns were thus discovered, saving
our own tanks from ambush and permitting a concerted plan of attack to remove the
resistance and allow the column to proceed .
Our light tank' was used to great advantage in ncviir :; with the infantry
forward line to assist them i:l mopping hcs""-â¢ =i_e resistance tin __.ch had been passed
over by the heavier leading tanks .
The maneuverability of our tanks can be greatly enhanced by wider tracks .
Increased maneuverability of tanks across country at the expense of speed is
highly desirable, and above all, our tanks should carry the highest velocity and
heaviest gun that can be carried consistent with other considerations, such as
weight"" and power . Armor should be sacrificed for gunpower and maneuverability on
every occasion . Tanks must be withdrawn from the line after two or three days of
continuous fighting but can be put into battle again after a short rest of twenityfour
to forty-eight hours .
he task crew fights all day and spends a lar â¢7e part of the night on
maintenance and suppi'T of' -soline and ammunition Consequently, they get little
rest . The service of the crew in the tank is i:_ost fati;;uing due to the foul air,
heavy jolting, and hammering .
A high explosive shell
.i.r
t.'_ :-: h.,st type of x ti_? _ tt -y fire to be used in
front of tanks . This type of `'ire enables the ta-i:_ commander to keep his
aead out of the turret, thereby giving she tank about fif y percent more efficiency
than it would have if the tan were :oapletely buttoned up . Our tankers in the
rmored Division insist on the tark co-:Traeder ka ening his hF:-d out of the turret and
won't serve under a commander who han't ' ::e co'--'age t- do tâ¢::.:_s . However, the
sermans know this, and we lost quite a few tank con-~manc_ers by sniping fire . Time
18
fire by the artillery can be placed directly on top of the tank formation when the
tanks arc buttoned up but has the disadvantage that the tank is blind and is only
about twenty-five percent efficient .
Artillery fire can be placed within fifty yards of the tanks without any
undue damage . This requires careful adjustment of fire by the artillery and
perfect coordination and te ,m-rork .
The three great enemies of the tank are terrain, which restricts their
maneuverability, the antitank gun, which can. be concealed and destroy the tank
at close range, and the mine, which can disable the tank termporarily . The
ordinary. mine usually blows the track which can be replaced very quickly . However,
it must be remembered that a tank once it hits a mine will never operate with the
same mechanical efficiency again because, although the track and bogies may be
replaced, certain stresses and strains are set up in the driving mechanism due to
the sudden stopping of the machinery. A tank that has hit a mine never operates
at more than seventy-five to eighty percent of its original mechanical efficiency .
12. Mines .
The extensive use of mines, both antitank and antipersonnel, by the German
is one of the greatest menaces of the present war . No area, either forward or
back, is aafe from the mine. The most effective enemy mining tras the sporadic
mining of long stretches of road, road shoulders, craters, and areas upon withdrawal.
Heavily mined fords strewn with metal fragments to render detectors useless
were also effective delays . In general, the enemy's mine technique and mine
equipment were superior to our own .
During the later phases of the African campaign and throughout the Italian
campaign the Germans employed a box mine made of wood and having practical) y no
metal which made it almost impossible to`detect with a mine detector. Also, there
was introduced the shoe mine which was a sm ll wooden box hidden in the grass or
under the leaves and used as an antipersonnel mine .
Late in the Italian campaign a new type of antipersonnel mine appeared
made entirely of plastic except for the detonating device . The Gcrnans stre^fred theft
freely along the ditches and roadways . The German positions around the Anzio
Beachhead were thoroughly covered with nine fields . They presented a great problem
to the passage of tanks, a problem which was not solved . A large proportion
of the heavy losses of tanks in the breakthrough at Anzio were caused by going
through these i 'ne fields . The antitank mine has no sure antidote except the slow,
painful process of picking up the mines by detectors or by charging through the
rdne fields at great loss to vehicles .
The ""snake"" was successfn nll y used in the breakthrough at Anzio and has
eossibilities whore the 2L.ne field can be located dead of time and where conditions
are favorable for approaching with a tank to push the ""snake"" through the field.
Several lanes were blown through mine fields with a great demoralizing effect on
the energy . However, the danger with the ""snake"" is its susceptibility to being
set off by artillery and causing heavy casualties by our own troops in the immediate
vicinity .
19
There was also developed a primer cord which was shot out of an infantry
mortar and when detonated, cleared a path about 20 inches wide through the grass
exploding the antipersonnel mines .
Tanks are impervious to the antipersonnel mine and can go through wire
entanglements, which are usually strung with antipersonnel mines, clearing a way
for the infantry. However, the solution to the problem of locating mines and mine
fields is yet to be found .
Intensive mine training must be given to every officer and man, regardless
of his duties. This should include detection, disarming, where Lines are mostly
likely to be found, etc . Our own mines proved to be a great menace . P-tany local
operations were conducted during the siege of the beachhead such as raids on en , ~ r
strong points, etc ., and in almost every case we had as much damage done by our
own mines as we did by hostile mines . The sectors were occupied by different
divisions, each one putting in more mines, and a careful . record was not kept, as
it should have been, as to location of the mines installed . Troops frequently
place mines in front of their positions at night as a protection and go off foregetting
to raise them or mark them properly . The result is heavy casualties to ,
other troops which pass over the same ground later . Much more drastic discipline
and training in the handling of mines and the use of mines by our own people has
got to be employed .
13 . Miscellaneous .
One of the most important items of equipment is the armored bulldozer .
It played an important part in the pursuit of the Germans in Italy . Without it
we couldn't have advanced as all bridges and culverts were blown, and house .
were often blown into the streets . A greater proportion of armored bulldozers
should be set up.
In the early days of the war we dissipated a great many 50 calibre
machine guns and also 30 calibre machine guns by placing them on peeps, trucks,
and vehicles for antiaircraft defense . This has been partially rectified but we
still are wasting too many machine guns for this purpose . It is absolutely unnecessary
to install machine puns on peeps and indiJidna1 passenger vehicles . 30
calibre machine guns are practicall y useless against air, and it is a grave question`
whether men will remain in their vehicles and fire any type of machine gun against
a low flying hostile airplane.
I
The 37 millimeter gun is another weapon that has been built in large
quantities and which has no practical use accept in small quantities in the
infantry to operate against machine gun nests .
In pursuit in rough country, column comet riders must be well forward .
'-there only the first few leading tanks are engaged, a column commander should have,
:is tank not more than six vehicles from the front, and the infantry commander I
should be right with him .
The Cub airplane has proven to be one of the greatest assets for artillery
fire and, contrary to expectation, has been able to survive on the battlefield
in spite of hostile aii .
20
For liaison communications between infantry-tank-tank destroyer teams it
is essential that a sufficient number of radio sets SCR-300 be available to permit
distribution down to and including infantry companies, tank platoons, and tank
destroyer gun sections .
All artillery should receive training in direct fire over the sights in
addition to their normal indirect fire training . All tanks and tank destroyers
should receive indirect fire training for use as artillery in addition to their
normal direct fire training and should be equipped with the necessary sighting
apparatus for indirect fire .
During a pursuit the use of reconnaissance dements, as the leading
element in a force, merely because contact has been lost locally, is not justified
in most circumstances . Where the nature of the expected next resistence can be n
any way deduced - and it usually can - appropriate composition of the column
should be made ahead of time to overcome it ; usually time is saved in the long
run if medium tanks lead . If demolitions, only lightly defended, are to be
expected, light tanks in front work well . Putting a reconnaissance element in
front is advisable only when it can be used deployed ; in a situation wherein
nothing more serious than undefended demolitions are expected or where a route
reconnaissance appropriate to armored reconnaissance is expected to be the first
operational problem to be met . In pursuit situations, liaison missions are so
frequent that there is ample work for available reconnaissance without seeking
opportunities for its employment otherwise . In a pursuit the three most habitual
and most profitable uses of the armored reconnaissance platoon hate been :
a . Contact patrols to contact flank units .
b. Flank observation posts .
c . Reconnaissance of alternate routes parallel to axis of advance .
Motorcycles again proved their worth in the last operation . Because of
the ability of the cyclist to get through heavy traffic quickly, the carrying of
written communications was greatly expedited . Because of the single axis of
communication available to the battalion throughout the operation, traffic was
always congested, and during one phase, it tool: a motorcycle fifteen minutes to
deliver an important message over a route that took a ""peep"" one hour and twenty
minutes to travel .
Recent actions involving much combat reconnaissance have revealed the
necessity for the following modifications in the Armored Car M-8 :
a. . Added protection on the floor to protect the cre :â¢r from mines ;
signing the floor to permit heavy sandbagging would be of some value .
b . Better protection for the radiator. A regimental reconnaissance
company had twelve (12) cars knocked out of action due to shell fragments through
he radistors during a period of less than one month .
c . Add a .30 Cal iâ¢:G bow-gun to be operated by the assistant driver .
21
The hatches for the driver and assistant driver on light tanks should be
redesigned to permit unrestricted movement of the gun when hatches are open . On
many occasions the gun is fired when it is not advisable for the tank to button up .
In operations in mountainous or otherwise difficult terrain, the M-4
tank dozer proved to be the most valuable vehicle in the entire force . It is
capable of working under artillery fire and the speed with which these vehicles
were able to repair obstacles was not approached by any other method . They were
kept well forward in the column at all times as they could rapidly reach the head
of the column when needed .
Present camouflage nets are very inflammable . Many have - been set on fire
by - shells or bombs causing great vehicular damage and loss . The garnishing
material is not dyed fast and must be replaced in a few months .
When TDs are firing in artillery roles, it is highly desirable to have
a large size fire extinguisher placed in a hole to rear of Zi-lO .
Sights, both direct and panoramic, should be equipped with night lighting
devices . Makeshift lighting devices are not satisfactory . In direct fire at
night, hits simply will not be obtained -without such devices .
At the present time all members of the armored car crew in reconnaissance
elements are aimed with the carbine . It has been found that an automatic weapon
similar to the Thompson Sub-'Machine Gun must be the ann of one of the occupants cf
the turret of the armored car particularly when operating in close areas infested
with enemy infantry. The enemy -will watch the traverse of the turret and move
towards the armored car when the turret guns are not pointed directly at them .
This automatic weapon provides necessarily rapid close in fire against these
individuals who attempt to disable the vehicle by approaching from blind spots .
The ""Bazooka"" would be more effective if the ammunition was more sensitir^
to detonation . Its effect on houses and fortified strong points would be doubled
if it did not take much a direct hard blow against a very solid substance to
detonate it .
The packing of mortar ammunition should be improved . A wood chest, 3
rds per chest, with a handle for carrying, is suggested .
Combined infantry-tank trainina cannot be stressed too much, Recent
intensive trai ning of the armor of this division with infantry elements of another/
division proved to be of great value . This was shown by closer cooperation,
better understanding of cs.pabilities and limitations of troops, weapons of other
units . However, it is felt that while close support of tanks, medics, or light, is~
desirable, it was found not to be always practicable . In most instances it has
moved for:rard faster than foot troops can advance . By lingering and waiting for
infantry to mop up, the tanks e;---pose themselves unduly, and if the tanks continue
on, enemy infantry krill rise up and a regular infantry battle ensues, thereby
breaking up the tank-infantry team play. This situation u as remedied by using
medium tanks for the assault punch and attaching light tanks to the infantry to
22
assist in mopping up operations . It is believed that semi-permanent tank-infantry
teams, trained together and used together whenever possible in combat will alone
insure the accomplishment of a tough mission .
More training must be devoted to the meaning and requirements of one's
combat mi ssions . This will require cor~anders of all echelons to be more careful
and concise in the assignment of the mission, to question the subordinate commander
carefully to avoid all possible misunderstanding of the mission . It will also
require the subordinate commander to devote :sore care to the complete understanding
of his mi ssion . Then, he must be allowed fell independence of action within the
scope of his mission. With the full knowledge of what is to be required of him,
the subordinate trill be able to conduct himself and his command more irate ligenUir,
with the long term requirement in view . it will also render the constant repetition
of orders, which are dependent on perfect radio communication (often
lacki-nig), much less necessary .
More emphasis must be placed on training of combat and reconnaissance
patrols . Use of pie scribed routes, resorts of where, when and what, and the
necessity for the accomplishment of the mission cannot be too strongly impressed
on combat personnel .
As this has been a discussion mainly on training, details as to recommendations
on changes in equipment and tables of organization, particularly as
pertain to an Armored Division, will be covered separately .

", and antitank
units must be allotted .
94. Areas which have been reported clear of the enemy will be
covered by the advance guard in one bound, except for short halts,
in order to enable the division to advance without hindrance . If
enemy activity is likely, the advance guard may be ordered to
proceed by bounds . This must not interfere with forward movement
of the division .
The interval between the advance guard and units following will
vary according to the strength of the formation and probability of
enemy activity. It may be as much as 1 hour.
If the advance of the division is delayed by road blocks in great
depth or by the enemy rearguard, it may be desirable to separate
those parts of the division which are not immediately required for
removal of obstacles or enemy resistance, and to allow them to
rest off the road until the advance can be resumed smoothly .
This avoids traffic jams and lessens wear and tear on both troops
and engines .
24
95 . Mat columns guard against threats to tha . ~fianks by
reconnaissance. When necessary, forces must be sent along
parallel roads to protect the main group, or must be pushed out to
the flanks of the main route of advance .
96. Antitank defense during movement will be provided by incorporating
antitank detachments in columns which are inadequately
equipped with antitank weapons . The companies of antitank
battalions will, for this purpose, be placed under command of
those groups to which they are to be assigned on deployment .
97 . For antiaircraft defense, light antiaircraft machine-gun
units will usually be assigned to each march column . At bottlenecks
and when the columns are halted, antiaircraft machine-gun
units must be employed en masse . Frequently antiaircraft
troops or antiaircraft machine-gun companies must be sent ahead
with the advance guard in order to provide early antiaircraft
defense at threatened points . Antiaircraft units can be employed
leapfrog fashion during the advance only if halts of considerable
length are made to enable them to push forward again .
Protection from daylight air attack demands full use of cover
and dispersion . The advance must be continued despite enemy
air attack . If this is impossible, the commander will order vehicles
to seek cover off the road with troops dismounted .
All troops and all suitable weapons will be employed in antiaircraft
defense . If road conditions permit, machine gunners will
open fire against low-flying aircraft independently, at the same
time warning other troops . Efforts must be made to obtain
fighter aircraft protection .
By night the advance will be halted only if enemy aircraft
directly attack the troops .
98. The possibility of gas-spray attack from aircraft must
always be borne in mind . Orders must be issued before the advance,
stating whether vehicles will use tarpaulins and whether
troops are to wear antigas capes .

hapter 7
DEPLOYMENT
99. As a rule, deployment precedes the division's organization
for battle. It enables units in the rear of the columns to move
quickly into battle, making full use of space for maneuvering.
The longer the columns, the earlier deployment must be ordered .
Increased readiness for battle compensates for the reduction in
speed resulting from advancing deployed .
100. The advance in deployed order is protected by combat
reconnaissance, If the tactical situation demands it, artillery
elements may be employed to cover deployment . Special routes
must then be allotted to the artillery, so that it may take up its
proper position after its support mission is completed .
101. If the division commander has insufficient data at the time
of deploying to lay down objectives to commanders of subordinate
units, the latter must advance by bounds deployed . New
bounds must be ordered early in order to obviate unnecessary
delays when bounds have been reached .
102 . Early orders are necessary for employment of antiaircraft
machine-gun units for the protection of deployment .

ATTA K
Section I
GENERAL
103. In armored division combat, the decision is gained by
attack of the entire tank brigade in one body . Employment of
the brigade is therefore of decisive importance . The main effort
will be made where the tanks can find suitable terrain and battle
conditions.
The role of the other units of the armored division is to provide
conditions necessary for employment of the armored brigade,
to support the tank attack, to protect the flanks, and to insure
that success is exploited by close support . The motorized infantry
enables the armored division to seize ground taken by the tanks
and hold it for a considerable period .
104. The armored division must endeavor, by obtaining early
possession of vital points, to open the way for an attack .
105 . If the armored division succeeds in surprising an enemy
ill prepared for defense, the division will attack without deploying .
Attack without deploying can also be considered if the enemy is
advancing to attack . The rapidity with which fire can be brought
to bear and the combination of fire power and movement in the
tank brigade compensate for the enemy's advantage in being
prepared for attack .
Attack is preceded by detailed preparation if the enemy's
defense is organized and antitank defense is expected .
106. The armored division's actual frontage of attack is normally
less than frontage of the sector allotted to it . It depends
upon the tactical situation, the terrain, and the nature and
strength of opposing forces.
An attack against an enemy whose defense is organized requires
concentration of the armored division's forces . Against an inferior
27
11 or demora ized enemy, or where there is little antitank opposition,
a series of attacks at several separated points is frequently successful
. Areas which have natural antitank defenses are well mined,
or are protected by strong antitank organization, may narrow the
attack or impose a temporary division of the attacking forces .
107 . Attack is made easier where the enemy has limited visibility.
Attack at dusk or during darkness may lead to decisive
results and completely disrupt the enemy . Suitable ground and
good roads along which to press home the attack are essential .
Fog precludes observed defensive fire, restricts the movements
of tanks, and makes it difficult to identify the objectives allotted
to them .
Smoke assists the attack of the tanks if it is used to screen flanks
and blot out antitank defenses and observation posts in the
enemy's rear. It can be laid down by attached smoke units,
tanks, or artillery, or can be sprayed or dropped in bombs by air â¢
craft . Spray from low-flying aircraft is possible only when the
enemy's antiaircraft defense is negligible or neutralized .
Section II
ONDU T OF THE ATTA K
108. Rapid and unexpected attack is the secret of success and
leads to decisive results .
109. In an attack without deployment, the objectives allotted
will generally be distant . Over difficult terrain or where the situation
is not clear, especially when the attack has not been preceded
by ground reconnaissance, the division may move forward by
bounds in order to keep its forces together in readiness for unified
action. Orders must be given early enough so that a steady,
unimpeded advance is maintained and the enemy is given no time
to organise his defense .
110. An axis will be laid down for the attack .
111 . Wherever possible the attack will be led by the tank
brigade. A short halt will usually be necessary in order to provide
the attack with requisite breadth and momentum . A favorable
opportunity will be exploited without delaying to make this preparation,
even if only part of the armored brigade is immediately
28
tank
avaiiable in such a case the remainder of~ the t~a~~k brigade willl
follow deployed, so that it may immediately be thrown into the
attack if the enemy's resistance stiffens .
112 . The success of the tank attack depends upon neutralizing
the enemy's antitank defense. All arms must support the tank
attack to this end .
113. The motorized infantry follows the tanks in vehicles,
deployed, as long as the enemy's fire allows . Troops dismount
in order to attack defense areas which the tank brigade has not
destroyed.
ontact between the tank brigade and the motorized infantry
following must not be broken . If there are enemy elements
which have not been attacked by the tanks, or if there is a likelihood
of enemy defense areas resuming activities after the tanks
have passed, the tank brigade must set aside part of its force to
assist the forward movement of the motorized infantry . It may
be desirable to attach part of the tank brigade to the motorized
infantry for this purpose .
114. The attack must be pressed home to the objective regardless
of threats to flanks . Threatened flanks will be protected by
motorized infantry or elements of the antitank battalion . Frequently
sufficient flank protection can be given by reconnaissance .
If the situation allows, it may be advisable to employ forces
farther in rear against an enemy attacking in the flank . This is
not done by diverting them so that they meet the enemy in a
frontal attack, but by using them even farther back so that they
in turn strike at the enemy's flank .
115 . An attack without deployment allows insufficient time to
organize any artillery preparation .
The artillery engages targets which have not been reduced by
the tanks and which impede the progress of tanks and infantry,
Such targets are primarily antitank weapons and defense areas in
country possessing natural tank defense (built-up areas, woods)
within and on either side of the sector in which the tanks are
attacking .
116 . In order to obviate the danger of dispersion of fire in a
rapidly moving battle, the commander must always make sure
that the fire of several batteries is concentrated on a single objective.
The main artillery effort should be concentrated either
29
far ahead of the tanks or outside their sector of attack. No
time ran be laid down for the artillery fire to be lifted . Isolated
targets which appear in the paths of the tanks must be engaged
by the tanks themselves .
117. It must be possible to support the tank attack throughout
its depth with observed fire. Accordingly, observation and command
posts must be pushed well forward before the attack begins,
and fire positions must be so chosen that the artillery fire follows
the line of attack as long as possible .
As a rule, part of the artillery, preferably batteries on selfpropelled
mounts, will be assigned to cooperate with the tank
brigade . The commanders of the tank and artillery units must
make every effort to confer . At the beginning of the battle the
artillery commanders will be at observation posts from which
they can give definite support in early stages of the attack .
118. If the tank attack gains ground, the artillery must be
kept in close support in order to prevent its losing contact in
subsequent stages of the assault . onstant support must be
insured by employing artillery troops in leapfrog fashion .
Artillery commanders will move quickly in command cars to
points from which they can follow the progress of the attack and
support it by concentrated, observed fire . Forward observers
in armored observation vehicles will move with the foremost
tanks .
Artillery liaison officers, who accompany commanders of the
tank units, communicate the latters' requirements to artillery
commanders . In addition, personal contact with commanders
of the tank units should be sought . Radio communication must
be established.
If, after a successful break-through, the tanks find themselves
in country clear of the enemy, all available routes must be used
in order to push the artillery forward with the last wave of tanks
so that they may be ready for action immediately if fresh enemy
resistance is encountered .
119. There must be close cooperation between artillery not
employed in direct support of the tank brigade and one or more
artillery spotting planes . This is essential if enemy artillery
is to be rapidly and effectively engaged and fire brought on important
targets concealed from ground observation .
30
Parts of this artillery will, if their fire can be controlled by
spotting planes, remain in their `re position as long as range of
the guns allows .
One of the most important tasks of the artillery spotter plane
is to keep watch for the appearance of enemy antitank and tank
forces, and to direct artillery fire against these targets . Valuable
data for the choice of fresh targets can be gained by the artillery
commander from listening to the reports of reconnaissance aircraft .
120. The armored engineer battalion will usually be attached to
the tank brigade. It accompanies the tank brigade, removing tank
obstacles encountered during the attack . Material for improvising
crossings over small cuts should be carried . Those parts of the
engineer battalion which are not yet equipped with engineer tanks
must follow as closely as possible behind the tank brigade .
121. The antitank battalion accompanies the tank brigade in the
attack, covering its flank and supporting it in neutralizing enemy
tank and antitank defenses . Antitank units not yet armored or
equipped with self-propelled mounts follow the armored brigade
by bounds, with the special task of engaging enemy tanks attacking
the flanks and rear of the tank brigade .
Parts of the antitank battalion can be employed to provide antitank
defense for the motorized infantry .
122 . Depending upon the air situation and nature of the terrain,
light antiaircraft artillery and machine-gun units attached can be
assigned the task of protecting the tank brigade, artillery, reserves,
and transport vehicle assembly points against enemy air reconnaissance
and attack . Headquarters and important supply
centers, especially for ammunition and gasoline, must frequently
be given protection .
123. Rapid progress of an attack while the division is in motion
rarely allows telephone communications to be established . Frequently
only the most important radio communications will be
possible because of the necessity of maintaining an adequate
reserve to meet unforeseen demands . There must always be
communication with the superior commander, the tank brigade,
the motorized infantry brigade, the artillery, the armored reconnaissance
unit, and the air reconnaissance unit .
124. If, in attacking on the move, the commander of the armored
division decides to use his motorized infantry as the spearhead of
31
attack, it will remain in vehicles as long as the enemy and the terrain
permit. After dismounting, its tactics will follow the principles
laid down for infantry in the attack .
As long as the infantry is moving in vehicles, artillery elements
on self-propelled mounts will follow closely in order to support
their attack rapidly with observed fire .
As soon as the enemy's resistance weakens, the motorized
infantry should return to its vehicles in order to make full use of
their speed.
The tank brigade should be held back until it can be used in
support of the motorized infantry,
Envelopment should be attempted .
The antitank battalion accompanies the motorized infantry
brigade in order to destroy enemy tanks . It may be advisable to
hold back the greater part of the battalion-frequently in rear of
the flanks-in, order to exploit its speed, mobility, and ability to
carry out surprise attacks against tanks . If the enemy's resistance
has been broken by the motorized infantry, the antitank
battalion can be pushed ahead of the foremost infantry in order to
attack and destroy enemy tanks . Advance artillery observers
should be assigned for this purpose .
125. If, after attaining the objectives, the task allotted does not
involve pursuit, the motorized infantry will hold the ground
gained, and will be supported by the tank brigade . This will be
done in accordance with principles laid down for the defense .
If the attack fails or appears likely to lead to no result, the
attacking forces should disengage and attack afresh at another
point .
126 . If the armored division encounters enemy tanks during
the attack, engaging them must take precedence over all other
tasks . The tank brigade must quickly find covered positions from
which it can fire effectively at the halt, while the enemy is compelled
to fight at a disadvantage (attacking over open country,
against the sun, with the wind) . This method is particularly
recommended when the enemy is superior in numbers of antitank
weapons . Success in these circumstances can also frequently be
gained by quick and determined attack, especially against the
enemy flanks .
If the enemy is inferior in numbers or armament, or if it is im-
32
1W
possible to find a favorable position, a short halt should be made
during which all armor-piercing weapons should he brought to
bear on him . The attack should then follow immediately, and
should, if possible, be supported by some elements firing at the
halt .
The rear waves of the tank brigade should be employed as far
as possible in enveloping attacks against the flanks and rear of the
enemy tank forces.
Extensive combat reconnaissance must be carried out by the
division, especially in the flanks and rear of the tank brigade, to
insure that the latter is secure from surprise attacks by enemy
tanks .
The artillery's task is to attack the enemy tanks while they are
deploying, breaking up their attack with concentrated fire .
Section III
ATTA K FROM AN ASSEMBLY POSITION
127. The purpose of an assembly position is to enable detailed
reconnaissance to be carried out, to allow units to take up their
allotted positions for the battle, and to insure cooperation of all
arms participating in and supporting the attack .
128. The assembly area must provide cover against enemy air
and ground observation ; it must be situated far enough forward
to enable the division to advance in battle order ; the artillery
must be able to carry out its tasks of supporting a break-through
without changing its positions, and heavy weapons must be able
to neutralize the enemy defenses, particularly his antitank
weapons.
Usually the tank brigade and those parts of the motorized
infantry which are to follow in vehicles behind the tank advance
will be held back ; so that they remain unexposed to enemy fire
and can eventually be employed with surprise effect . The more
thorough the reconnaissance, the longer it is possible to delay the
approach march and deployment of the tank brigade . If the
terrain permits the tank brigade to adopt its battle formation
well in rear of the battle area and to advance in this order, only a
short halt will be necessary in the assembly area .
The vehicles of those parts of the division which have previously
33
moved into the assembly area must not be allowed to impede
movement of the tank brigade .
129 . Surprise is assisted if the division move's into its assembly
area during dusk or darkness .
130 . Movement into the assembly area and the area itself
must be protected from enemy reconnaissance and surprise attack .
Antiaircraft machine-gun units must be assigned for defense
against enemy reconnaissance and attacking aircraft .
131 . The artillery moves up during the assembly . The
armored observation battery establishes its sound-ranging and
flash-spotting posts and plots enemy positions .
As far as is possible without sacrificing surprise, the engineers
remove tank obstacles in front of enemy positions and make all
necessary preparations for removing obstructions .
The armored signal battalion establishes line communications
within the division in order to supplement radio communications
during battle .
132 . The object of the attack is to break through the enemy's
defensive zone . This object is achieved when the enemy artillery
is destroyed and the enemy's main line of resistance is so broken
that the motorized infantry can follow up in vehicles . Only
after a successful break-through must a distant objective be
assigned .
133 . If there are tank obstacles or natural antitank defenses in
front of or within the enemy defensive position, the first stage of
the attack will be carried out by the motorized infantry alone .
It advances through the enemy main line of resistance until the
obstacles barring the tank advance are removed .
The advance of the tank brigade must be so arranged that when
obstacles are removed it can penetrate deeply into the main enemy
defensive zone, accompanied by the motorized infantry .
134: If it has been possible to remove obstacles in front of the
enemy position before the attack, and no obstacles are likely to be
encountered in the main line of resistance, the attacks of the tank
brigade and the motorized infantry will be launched simultaneously
. By this means the armored division brings all its weapons
to bear effectively at the decisive moment of attack to destroy the
enemy's defenses and lend momentum to the advance .
135. If the terrain is favorable and no tank obstacles have been
34
reported, the tank brigade will precede the motorized infantry in
attack on the enemy position . This a'ssists the movement of the
motorized infantry to the enemy position, speeds the operation,
and reduces casualties .
136, The attack of the tank brigade is carried out according to
the principles of an attack not preceded by deployment .
137 . Targets against which the artillery is to concentrate its
fire before and during the attack depend upon the method of
attack. If the attack is led by the motorized infantry, the main
effort will be directed against enemy infantry weapons . If tanks
precede the motorized infantry in the attack, the artillery's main
task will be to destroy or neutralize with smoke the enemy antitank
weapons. It may be desirable to lay down smoke shortly
before the attack in order to neutralize enemy observation posts
and antitank weapons .
If the enemy is occupying strongly prepared positions, it will
usually be necessary to lay down an artillery preparation which
should be preceded by careful target reconnaissance .
If surprise is to be gained, or if the tactical situation is obscure,
it is frequently advisable to delay opening fire until enemy
resistance is encountered, and then to destroy it with concentrated
fire. As the attack progresses, artillery support is governed by
the same principles that apply to an attack not preceded by
deployment .
138 . If the motorized infantry leads the attack, it will have
armored engineers attached, Elements of the armored engineer
battalion follow closely behind the motorized infantry brigade to
clear the way for the tanks following .
139. The bulk of the antitank battalion will be attached to the
motorized infantry leading the attack ; elements will be allotted to
protect movement forward from the assembly positions .
140 . If the armored division attacks through an infantry division,
all forces of the infantry division operating in its sector will
be attached to the armored division . This insures that :
a. All weapons and troops of the infantry division are concentrated
under a unified command in support of the tank attack .
b . Movements of the armored division and the infantry division
are coordinated .
This arrangement will end when the main body of the armored
35
division is no longer in contact with the infantry . It will frequently
be necessary for the higher command to hold up movement
of the infantry division in order to allow the armored
division to continue its advance .
141 . If the armored division is ordered to give fresh momentum
to an attack by other troops, the attack will be carried out either
by the tank brigade or simultaneously by the tank brigade and
the motorized infantry brigade . The attack will be supported by
the mass of the armored division's artillery and antitank units .
142 . The higher commander will decide whether the whole or
parts of the division shall be temporarily diverted from the original
axis of attack in order to widen a breach in the enemy's position .
Provision will be made to cover the new flank which is thus formed .
143 . If the armored division is ordered to exploit success
gained by an infantry division with the object of developing it
into a complete break-through, the attack will always be carried
out by the tank brigade . The motorized infantry will follow in
vehicles as closely as possible behind the tank brigade . Strategic
objectives will be assigned . As it is important not to dissipate
efforts of the armored division but to maintain strictest concentration
in view of tasks which remain after the break-through, the
artillery and other heavy weapons will be employed only insofar
as they are necessary for completion of the break-through .
36
hapter 9
PURSUIT
144. Success must be exploited without respite and with every
ounce of strength, even by night. The defeated enemy must be
given no peace . The only factors which must be allowed to cause
a temporary halt are exhaustion of fuel and ammunition, and
even then contact must be maintained . The attack must be
resumed as soon as fresh supplies have been received .
145. Every effort should be made in pursuit to overtake the
enemy. If the enemy succeeds in maintaining a front in its withdrawal,
the armored division must break through the enemy
resistance at several points and use its speed to occupy ground in
the path of retreat . The nature of the terrain and strength and
attitude of the enemy decide whether the tank brigade is to be
pushed forward in mass formation or in task forces .
Night attacks are likely to be particularly successful .
146. If there is danger of losing contact with the enemy, elements
possessing greater speed, i . e ., motorized infantry, motorcyclists,
and antitank units, will be employed in the pursuit . In
this case, engineers will be assigned . If reinforced by equally
mobile forces, the armored reconnaissance unit can strike swiftly
and with decisive results .
147 . If the division has penetrated deep into the enemy lines in
its pursuit, it will establish a system of defense areas for its
protection at rest and by night . They should be designed to
enable heavy fire to be directed from every side .
148 . If enemy resistance stiffens, all forces engaged in pursuit
must be concentrated quickly under unified command for a fresh
attack .
149 . Strong artillery forces must always move directly behind
the foremost elements . Strict cooperation with division reconnaissance
aircraft is essential . Fighter and bomber support
increase the chances of success .

", to quote from
A Division That Can Attack, the following was the reason given for telling the
British Army how to reorganize itself: the British regular division is the
prototype of all the divisions of all the forces of the Empire, it having been agreed
long ago in Imperial Conference that organization and training should be uniform.
Hence, a Dominion officer who feels it is his duty to suggest improvements in
military organization must argue the case for all (Col. Burns italics) the Empires
forces, and first of all in the British regular army, taking cognizance of the whole
range of that armys duties The passage quoted is a sound reason for
volunteering suggestions in regard to changes in British organization, only so long
as that organization and the suggested changes react upon our own. Beyond that
point, our attitude as Canadians towards the problems of defence, leaves little
justification for offering advice to other parts of the Empire. Let us concentrate
upon setting our own house in order. We may then be in a position to offer advice
to others.
In the sphere of military defence, Great Britain by virtue of her
geographic position and economic structure must have a first class navy and a first
class air force. With a navy and air force kept at a strength equal or superior to
any likely rival power, or combination of powers, she is safe against the knockout
blow. The burden which the maintenance of these two services (and the
ground organization for air defence) puts upon the British taxpayer, places a first
class field army beyond the range of sound finance. It has been the oft expressed
opinion of British statesmen that an attempt to support in times of peace an army
on a continental scale would result in financial and economic collapsefollowed
by disintegration of the Empire. It would be the negation of defence, using that
word in its widest sense. The British Regular Army is maintained for home
defence, to garrison vital points on Empire lines of communication and to provide
a small strategic reserve to meet Imperial commitments or perhaps reinforce an
ally on the continent of Europe. The policy of the British Government in regard
to the employment of the Regular Army was carefully defined in the speech of the
Secretary of State for War when introducing the Army Estimates on 11th March,
1938.4 Col. Burns cannot have studied this statement of policy. In it, the
organization of an expeditionary force for employment on the continent of Europe
is last in order of priority of the tasks of the Regular Army.
Behind the Regular Army is the potential in manpower and industry to
raise a great national army should it prove unnecessary in a continental war. The
field formations of the Territorial Force form the peacetime framework upon
which a national army may be built.
If the armies of Britains allies are strong enough to defeat their enemies
without British aid, then it would be sound allied strategy to try for an immediate
and simultaneous decision by land, sea and air. But if this is not the case, then
common sense demands that the allies should postpone a decision on land until
British war potential has had time to develop. In the first instance their land
strategy should be defensive. True, this does not exclude the tactical offensive.
No doubt the British contribution of a powerful striking force, to act as the
spearhead of all offensive action (as inevitably it would) would be gratefully
accepted on the continent. The wisdom of employing in this manner the only fully
trained troops at the disposal of the British Government is a different matter.
In 1914 nearly the whole of the Regular Army was despatched to the
continent within a few weeks of the outbreak of war. This marked the beginning
of four years of abortive offensives aimed at gaining a decision in the west. The
training of the national army was improvised as best it could be, without trained
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
186
staffs and instructors and without equipment. It was reinforced by formations of
the New Armies, hustled into battle without proper equipment, support or
training. From then onwards British manpower and material were dribbled into
action to maintain pressure on the enemy. Heavy casualties resulted and the
ranks of fighting units were always filled with a high percentage of half-trained
drafts. Pressure was maintained but there was never a pause long enough to
conserve the energy for a punch. In the spring of 1918, when conscription had
failed to provide the drafts required to keep units up to strength, the Germans
played into the hands of the Allies with a gamblers throw for victory. Was this
method of conducting war so successful that the opening move should be
repeated? Circumstances may force Great Britain to send troops to the continent
before she is prepared. No set of circumstances can justify offensive action which
has not a reasonable prospect of success.
The writer is accused of harbouring the insidious notion that the
British Armys task will be predominately defensive.5 It is difficult to understand
how this deduction can have followed from the statement: An army, no matter
what its size, must be an army that can attack.6 The value of and necessity for
offensive action are fully understood. On the contrary, the offensive merely for its
own sake  to maintain a principle  has proved too costly a policy in the past to
warrant repetition. Defensive action cannot gain a decision. No more can the
offensive unless backed by the power required to drive it home.
In the sphere of design, Col. Burns comparison between the work of the
War Office and that of works officers of the Corps of Royal Canadian Engineers
is a fair analogy. Both have the same nature of problems to face though in vastly
different fields. Design, to be good, must be restricted by the medium available
and within the means available for building. It is useless to design a bridge in
reinforced concrete when only wood can be obtained for construction. The
District Engineer Officer who, told to make one room into two, tore down the
building and produced a perfect but costly design for its replacement (with the
necessary two rooms instead of one), might get a gold medal from the Institute of
Architects but would probably get a court martial from his D.O.C. when roof and
walls must be left intact to give protection against stormy weather, the scope of the
designer, no matter what his vision, is limited to putting or removing the
partitions.
Within the British Empire the British Regular Army is the only strategic
reserve of land forces immediately available. With the League at its zenith and
public opinion concentrated upon the realization of disarmament, the money
needed for Army reform was not forthcoming from the British taxpayer we are
always being asked for some reason or other to cut down the Army Estimates.
What Price Assault Without Support?
187
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
188
Every year we are asked to cut things out and we have got to do everything out of
savings. No big company ever did such a thing; they issue further shares and work
on capital. They do not modernize their business out of savings7 So spoke the
C.I.G.S. in 1929. By the time the danger had become apparent to the public it had
reached a point where heavy demands were being made on the Regular Army.
Scrap and Rebuild was no longer a practical policy. The roof and walls had
to be kept intact to give protection against storms which were, with a change of
season, no longer just visible on the horizon but starting to break. A rebuke to
Great Britain for failure to rearm with greater energy would come ill from a
Canadian.
No one claims that the British Division as at present organized is perfect,
but some realize that army re-organization has had to be carried through in face of
practical difficulties. What the writer claims is that it is unsound to base reorganization
on the theory that the line of battle division must be a division that
can attack.
Col. Burns historical evolution of the division follows closely a similar
study by Captain Liddell Hart. It is of none but academic interest to the military
historian. It is strange to find one who has so often expressed contempt for
outworn tradition, himself indulging in traditional argument. In an age of
totalitarian war, the Army has replaced the division in the Napoleonic
conception of an independent strategic formation. Why? Because in continental
warfare with the extension of the idea of the Nation in Arms, with battlefields
stretching over half a continent, operations on a divisional scale are mere
pinpricks with no strategic significance. Whats in a name? The term division
has survived to describe a mixed formation of about 15,000 men. True, we might
give this another name and reserve the term Division for a force capable of
attaining strategic results independently. If the psychological effect of this change
of nomenclature will help win the next war, by all means let us make the change!
The fact remains that a force the size of the division, as that term is now generally
understood in all the worlds armies, is no longer capable of attaining independent
strategic results in continental warfare. The area within which it can exert
pressure (Col. Burns super division can attack, according to his claims, on a
front of 4000 yards) is too small to produce anything but purely local effects.
In regard to Col. Burns estimate of the capacity of British industry, it is
only necessary to make two observations. Tanks do not consist of a chassis alone.
Armour and armament are also required  both products of a highly specialized
industry which cannot be expected to have flourished in a period when the public
cry was kill the armaments maker. It is interesting to note that in the example
quoted by Col. Burns for supply of Allies tanks in 1919, Great Britain was to
What Price Assault Without Support?
189
supply the armour and armament, though at that time the United States was the
greatest steel and motor manufacturing country in the world.  America
decided to build another 1500 tanks at home as well as many thousands of Renault
Tanks. She found, however, greater difficulty than she had expected in making
armour plate and guns, so it was arranged that the second 1500 should also be
assembled at our French factory on the same terms as the first, England supplying
the armour plate and guns, America the engines.8
Secondly, if industry can provide 2560 tanks, it would be unsound to
equip active units with more than 1000. The balance would be required to replace
casualties and in the form of spare parts for repair. At Cambrai, the first great tank
battle of the war, 216 tanks went into action at zero  165 or over 75% of the
numbers engaged were held in reserve as spare machines to replace casualties.
Yet, on the second day of the battle only 145 tanks were able to continue the fight.
In the Battle of Amiens, considered one of the most successful attacks of the last
war, 480 tanks went into action of which 39 were hit. On the third day only 67
tanks were available of which 30 were hit during the days fighting. By 11th
August the Royal Tank Corps could no longer operate. Admittedly, improvements
in mechanical efficiency and reliability of machine will result in fewer casualties
from mechanical failure, but this will be balanced by a vast increase in the efficacy
of modern anti-tank defence. A tank force which is backed by less than 150
percent spares ex-factory will be a flash in the pan incapable of any sustained
effort in war.
Col. Burns main argument for including a tank brigade within the
division is that unless tanks form an integral part of the formation, co-operation
between all arms will suffer. He further claims that unless tank training is their
direct responsibility, divisional commanders will not learn how to employ them or
how to attack. It is convenient to examine the latter contention first.
Will the addition of assaulting power without the addition of the means of
supporting assault, improve the attack technique of divisional commanders? In
training for the attack, the launching of infantry to the assault without the fire
support required to put them on their objective has been the main subject of
adverse comment by military critics. To substitute unsupported tanks for
unsupported infantry is not going to result in greater realism. To quote from A
Division That Can Attack: With four tank battalions in the division, probably
not more than two would attack in line simultaneously, allowing for reserves to
penetrate in depth. Each could attack on a 2000 yard front  4000 yards in all.
The probability is that such a division would normally attack on a shorter front.
Assuming the 4000 yards, however, and that the frontage a gun can effectually
cover in a barrage is twenty yards, 200 guns would be required to cover the front
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
190
 Obviously it would be impracticable to have so many guns permanently with
the division. Let us assume that only about one third will be on the division
establishment, the remainder being provided for offensives from corps or higher
artillery reserves. Col. Burns admits that it is impractical to include the necessary
fire support within the division. Without it, his unbalanced division will still be
unable to attack. For many of the tasks allotted to the division the assault power
of a tank brigade will not be needed, yet these tanks may be employed to a greater
advantage, or urgently required, in another battle area. It is a psychological fact
that most human divisional commanders are very reluctant to give away anything
which authority has admitted to be an essential part of their formation. This
tendency would be accentuated in a division such as Col. Burns suggests. With
only two infantry brigades, tanks would generally constitute the divisional
reserve.
Co-operation between all arms is of vital importance, but the writer
believes that this can be achieved without including tanks in the divisional
organization. An Army Tank and Army Artillery Circus should be available for
attachment to divisions for attack exercises during their training. By varying the
number of tank battalions and artillery regiments made available to divisions a
further important lesson relevant to the offensive may be stressed  namely to
limit the scope of an attack to the resources available. There is no difficulty in
arranging the peace stations of army tank battalions so that they will be able to
work with other arms during unit training. Tanks were not included in divisional
organization during the war, yet, with the exception of the 51 Division, there was
no difficulty in training tanks and infantry to work together before the Battle of
Cambrai. It is the duty of the Directorate of Military Training (and those who
appoint divisional commanders) to see that instances such as that which arose with
the 51 Division do not recur.
In the war 1914-18 massed artillery and surprise was the formula for
successful attack. Given those two conditions and the break-in succeeded
whether tanks or infantry were the main assaulting arm. Neither the Allies nor the
Germans ever achieved a break-through on the Western Front. In the future
given sufficient support, the range and endurance of tanks may enable them to
convert a break-in into a break-through. But the increase in anti-tank
weapons will make the unsupported tank assault of the future as costly as the
unsupported infantry assault of the past. Air bombing may develop to the stage
where massed air craft, converging from distant aerodromes, can provide a
sustained bombardment of the necessary accuracy and intensity to give covering
fire to troops. This would obviate the difficulty of a secret concentration of
masses of artillery close to the front of the attack. The number of aircraft required
for such tactics are no more suitable for embodiment in the divisional organization
What Price Assault Without Support?
191
than are the 200 guns mentioned above.
Col. Burns has tried to create a division that can attack by adding
assaulting power without the means of supporting it, and if history gives us any
guidance, what price assault without support?

ANNEX C
The Attack
By Captain G.G. Simonds
Royal Canadian Artillery
Canadian Defence Quarterly Vol. XVI, No. 4, July 1939
I  Introductory
Ever since the close of the war in 1918, British tactical doctrine, as
exemplified in training exercises both with and without troops, has been under fire
from military critics. Censure of defence doctrine is a comparatively recent
development but prolonged and violent criticisms have been directed against our
training for the attack. In spite of artful ripostes by the vested interests  the older
fighting arms with a long and honourable tradition of supremacy on the
battlefield  much of this criticism is justified. But the writer believes that the
fault rests, not with our doctrine, but with the manner of its interpretation.
Our Field Service Regulations, and training manuals generally, are most
frequently condemned because they are said to be too indefinite. It is claimed that
they are too inconclusive and replete with remarks of the type: Under certain
conditions this may be the right thing to do, but then, on the other hand, it may be
quite wrong and that in fact a quotation can be found in F.S.R. to justify any
tactical act or course of action. No book of doctrine can be a substitute for
common sense and good judgement. Before opening the cover of any training
manual the reader must ask himself the question: For what conditions has this
manual been written? The answer so far as British manuals are concerned is:
They visualize operations against every type of enemy, over every type of terrain,
almost anywhere in the world.
So long as Great Britain remains a world power her Army must be trained
to meet the commitments and obligations which are inseparable from a world wide
political responsibility. A study of the varied operations in which British troops
were engaged during the War 1914-18 in France, Northern Italy, Macedonia,
Gallipoli, Egypt and Palestine, Mesopotamia and East Africa, affords convincing
evidence that British tactical doctrine cannot be dogmatic in its interpretation of
modern war. Cavalry charges that rode over the Turks in Palestine would have
withered away before German barbed wire and machine guns in France. A
German attack, planned and executed like the offensives in France in March and
April, 1918, would have sent British troops from their precarious hold on the
beaches of Gallipoli, hurtling into the sea.
The writer has had occasion to study certain continental tactical doctrine.
In comparison with the substance of our own training manuals it is more definite
and at first sight appears much more realistic in its appreciation of the
characteristics of modern war. This first impression must be modified when one
bears in mind that one particular set of conditions for which such doctrine
legislates  a struggle between the armies of first class continental powers on the
battlefields of Western Europe. Deeper analysis shows it to be far too restricted in
vision to form the basis for the training of British troops. The possibility that the
British Army may have to fight in Western Europe becomes daily more of a
probability but it becomes equally probable that the Continent is not the only
theatre in which British troops may have to meet potential enemies. Official
training manuals must continue to take a broad view of the training, morale and
equipment of the enemy, of the type of ground over which it may be necessary to
operate and of strategical conditions which will vary with the theatre of war. But
the wisdom of concentrating in one manual a teaching which covers so wide a
field, without providing some additional guidance for special conditions, is open
to question. The writer believes it has led to much confusion of thought  that
action which a manual intends to justify against an enemy Category C.3. is often
interpreted as justifiable against an enemy Category A.1. There is much to be said
for the production of a supplementary manual dealing with one special set of
conditions  war against a first class enemy in a closely settled and civilized
country.
The enemy is by far the most important, and because that term
embraces individual and collective human beings, by far the most unpredictable
factor in any military situation. Ground and Time and Space are important but
their values are set by the character of the enemy. The enemy is the crux of the
problem in war. If our peace-time training exercises are to have any real value,
the imaginary enemy must be made to live. The writer has attended many
instructional exercises wherein the enemy, having been described in the Opening
Narrative as Category A.1. in the subsequent development of the situation have
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
194
been successfully dealt with and made to act as if they were Category C.3. No
tactical exercise, with or without troops, should be allowed to be used for training
until the action of the enemy has been worked out in terms of definite units and a
definite doctrine. To bring out certain lessons it is perfectly justifiable to place the
enemy at a disadvantage  state that they have suffered a series of heavy defeats;
that a strategical surprise has caught them off balance. It is not justifiable to make
them act as if they had not the slightest knowledge of the most elementary tactical
principles unless the Opening Narrative or General Idea has described them
as an untrained rabble.
It adds to realism if the organization and equipment of the enemy is
made different from our own  either based upon that of some foreign army or, to
avoid national susceptibilities, upon a reasonable combination of several. It is
equally an advantage to make the enemy operate in accordance with some foreign
doctrine in cases where the latter is at variance with ours. No very deep research
is necessary for this purpose  there is ample information in the various service
journals. One further observation is necessary. There is a school of thought which
rates the continental conscript army at a lower military value, man for man, than
the professional army raised by voluntary enlistment. This is a smug and
dangerous theory. It is true if conscript armies are raised as they were in the
British Empire during the war 1914-18  after having skimmed all the cream off
the surface by appeals on moral grounds the residual manpower was then forced
into military service as a body. It is not true of most continental countries,
democratic or otherwise, whose sons are taught from the day of their birth that
equal rights must be shared with equal responsibilities. The conscripted units of
a continental army represent a true cross-section of the nation. Though there must
be a representation of the weaker element in each unit, they are carried along by
the more virile group. The conscript soldier trains on a practically full strength
unit, for the number of active units in the national army is fixed by the predicted
strength of annual contingents called to the colours. Almost the whole of his
training with the colours is training for war. The volunteer soldier, particularly
during periods when recruiting is slack, often has to train in a unit that is little
more than a skeleton and a great proportion of his time is spent on fatigues, or the
hundred and one side-lines connected with interior economy, instead of on field
training. The officer in the conscript army is used to working with a full strength
unit and higher commanders and staffs get practice during peace time in handling
large formations. The officer in a voluntary army is called upon to train in what
are often the most disheartening conditions of make believe. The writer
believes that in the long run the better moral quality of the voluntary army will tell
in its favour. But during the early stages of a war, the general standard of training
and technique of both staffs and units of a conscript army will probably be better
The Attack
195
than those of an army which in peace time depends solely upon volunteers. An
unbiased study of the conditions of training under the two military systems cannot
lead to any other logical conclusion. The sooner we face this fact the less likely
are we to make disastrous mistakes in war.
The foregoing may appear irrelevant but the writer believes that the ideas
expressed are fundamental to all realistic training for war. Further, having
expressed the belief that tactics must depend to a great extent upon the character
of the opposing forces, the writer was under an obligation to explain that the
arguments which follow are meant to apply to the attack against a First Class
Enemy and what that term was intended to imply.
II  Phases of the Attack
The attack may be considered as comprising three inter-dependent
operations:-
(a) The Assault, which neutralizes or paralyzes the
defenders by imminent threat of destruction.
(b) Mopping Up, the process of disabling or
capturing the enemy before they recover from the temporary
paralysis engendered by the assault.
(c) Consolidation, the process of securing against a
hostile counter-stroke, the position already won so that it may
serve as a firm base from which to launch a further phase.
Exploitation is hardly a part of the attack proper, but rather the
advantageous use of a favourable opportunity created by the attack.
If hostile troops are caught in movement in the open, assault and mopping
up may merge and become one operation. But if the attack is directed against an
enemy in position, mopping up will generally entail disabling or forcing the
surrender of enemy detachments sheltering in weapon pits, trenches, dugouts,
buildings or woods. Consolidation is the hasty organization of defence and is a
holding task. Infantry are the only arm capable of mopping up an enemy in
position and except under unusually favourable conditions, the only arm capable
of consolidating a position won.
The assault is the phase of the attack about which most of the controversy
has centred. An Advanced Tank School claims that infantry are incapable of
pressing home an assault in face of a modern machine gun defence; that tanks
must rely on speed for their protection and that if encumbered by cooperating
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
196
The Attack
infantry they will only be handicapped in an operation which they are quite
capable of performing unassisted. A Reactionary Infantry School claims that
the tank has been rendered valueless by modern anti-tank defence and that even if
tanks can penetrate the defence, what can they do when they get there?
Therefore the first step in a study of the attack must be the analysis of conditions
on the modern battlefield to decide what should be the main assaulting arm. Such
an analysis must be carefully fixed in relation to time for science is continually
evolving new ideas and the introduction of a new weapon may revolutionize
tactics. But most armies are now committed to their rearmament programmes and
if war should come in the next five years there seems to be little doubt as to the
general type of weapons which would be employed  at least in the early stages.
III  The Main Assaulting Arm
The Conception of the Infantry Tank. The Infantry Tank is a heavily
armoured tank designed to give protection against the projectiles of small calibre
weapons. Road-widths, turning lock, bridging and conveyance by sea and railway
are all factors which limit the overall weight and size of tanks. With the
power/space ratio fixed, to mount a satisfactory armament and carry armour to
give the degree of protection required the Infantry Tank must sacrifice speed. In
comparison with the more lightly armoured medium tank, it is very slow. Those
who criticize the basic idea of the infantry tank claim that the gun will always beat
armour, and therefore it is unsound to increase armour at the expense of speed
which must remain the tanks best protection. This argument requires careful
examination. Against enemy troops caught in the open  as a weapon of
opportunity for surprise shock action  the fast tank with moderate protection is
by far the best weapon. But against an enemy in position, in well concealed
defences the locations of which will not be discovered except at close range, it will
not be possible for tanks to operate at high speeds and still neutralize the defence.
The tank depends mainly upon the firepower of its weapons to neutralize or
destroy the enemy. Except on very level ground, high speeds result in jolting
motion, an unsteady gun platform and inaccurate shooting. A tank with hatches
battened down for battle has a very limited field of view. Its crew will not be able
to locate enemy posts when the tank is travelling at high speed. The logical
conclusion seems to be, that no matter what the maximum speed of which a given
tank may be capable, the pace at which it can advance through and neutralize an
organized defence will be slow. In regard to the argument that the gun will always
beat armour, modern improvements in armour plate necessitate the employment of
a fairly big gun to penetrate the armour which a ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

â 7 METHODS OF OPERATION -a Offensive operations of
armored units acting either alone or as part of a combined
force are characterized by rapid thrusts into vital parts
of the hostile rear followed by immediate exploitation to
complete enemy demoralization Armored division commanders
coordinate and control the movement of subordinate
units by appropriate assignment of routes zones objectives
or phase lines Phase lines are prescribed only
when required to insure coordinated action or movement of
two or more units and must not involve prolonged halts
thereon The attack is massed initially but is extended
promptly in frontage and depth by the armored reconnaissance
and combat elements after the hostile position is penetrated
As the operation gains momentum reconnaissance
agencies will precede combat elements at the earliest opportunity
to seek out and develop soft spots through which combat
elements may pass rapidly The more time allowed
for this reconnaissance the more effective it will be Contact
once gained must be maintained
b Maximum advantage is taken of speed and terrain
barriers to prevent or neutralize enemy countermeasures
Reconnaissance agencies provide information on which to
base security measures Other combat detachments provide
immediate advance flank and rear security Closely supporting
motorized units protect the immediate rear and lines
of communication of the armored elements Other motorized
units should relieve the armored unit commanders of
concern for extended lines of communication and assure continuous
logistical support When armored units are operating
as task forces the security of the immediate supporting
motorized elements will be enhanced by their following the

protect the flanks and relieve armored units temporarily
checked in order to permit their employment in a more
remunerative direction Whenever practicable other less
mobile troops will follow motorized task units as closely' as
possible to wipe out the last vestige of resistance meet
counterattacks and relieve the more mobile elements for
close support of the armored units
d In addition to establishing and maintaining local control
of the air supporting combat aviation is directed against
hostile antitank dispositions artillery and reserves especially
armored in the immediate zone of advance Concurrently
if available aviation suffices it may be directed
against hostile command and supply installations targets

formed bodies of troops especially armored units
e In an envelopment the support units of armored divisions
and task forces may when the situation demands
attack or contain enemy elements on the flank while tank
units make the main attack
f Troops transported by air may be suitably employed in
advance of armored units to seize critical points or to create
opportunity for immediate exploitation by armored forces
operating alone or as task forces
g Highly organized areas should be avoided Where their
attack is necessary it will usually be advisable for other
specially equipped infantry and engineer troops to breach
the enemy defenses in advance or concurrently with the
advance of the armored units unless heavy tanks are available
to lead the attack
h Against equal or superior hostile armored forces friendly
armored units will avoid frontal assault and maneuver to cut
off or destroy armored units supply facilities followed by
blows against the rear of enemy detachments
r 8 EXPLOITATION AND PURSUIT -a Large armored formations
operating separately or as part of task forces are especially
suited for exploitation and pursuit They should be launched
boldly against vital areas deep in the hostile rear The
exploitation and pursuit phase must be anticipated to insure
that appropriate plans are made and timely orders issued in
all echelons There must be no relaxing of pressure on the
shaken or beaten enemy Objectives for armored units should

be those which will halt hostile rearward movement until less
mobile friendly troops can close with the enemy Concurrently
some armored elements operate to destroy disrupt
and paralyze enemy communication and supply
b Pursuit by large armored units operating alone or as
major elements of task forces is rapid and continuous even
during hours of darkness
c When the operations of armored units are likely to carry
them beyond practicable operating radius of organic supply
means special provision must be made by the higher commanders
to place necessary supplies within operating radius
of the units Likewise special arrangements must be made
by higher headquarters for rapid communication with the
widely dispersed elements of armored formations
â¢ 9 DEFENSIVE SITUATIONS Large armored units as part of
other major forces on the defensive are held in readiness for
the counteroffensive or major counterattack The employment
of the armored units must be carefully timed and coordinated
with the attack objectives of the other forces
Local air superiority during the period of the counteroffensive
or major counterattack is a prerequisite to success of the
operations Usually the armored attack should be delivered
to disrupt the continuity of the hostile offensive and not
mefely to restore the defensive position
â¢ 0 LOGISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS -a Where prolonged operations
of armored divisions and corps or GHQ tank units are
contemplated adequate arrangements must be made by the
higher headquarters to insure timely replenishments of supplies
required by the armored units Where the armored units
are required to operate at great distances from their base of
supply when continuity of supply is interrupted by enemy
action and in other emergency situations delivery of urgent
supplies may be made by air
b Where several armored divisions or GHQ tank units are
under control of one headquarters consideration should be
given to retaining one or more division or GHQ tank units in
reserve either for the purpose of extending combat operations

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
0 ORDERS -a Orders follow the general form prescribed
in FM 0 -5 Mission type orders will be frequent Warning
and fragmentary orders in the form of messages overlays
and oral instructions are freely used to give early instructions
to subordinates so they will have adequate time to make their
reconnaissance and prepare their plans Orders of this
type together with operation maps aerial photographs and
standing operating procedure will reduce the scope of orders
of execution to a minimum
b Save in the beginning of an operation the use of formal
written orders will be exceptional Orders will normally be
dictated or oral and often fragmentary in units smaller than
the corps All commanders must be trained not only to be
able to give brief clear oral orders but also to be able to act
intelligently on receipt of any such orders
c Orders for combat must be thoroughly understood by all
subordinate commanders and their units They must be
timely to permit necessary dissemination and reconnaissance
by various affected echelons
2 COMMUNICATIOxs --a The usual methods of communication
used within armored units are visual signals motorcycle
messengers liaison officers radio and command airplanes
b Visual signals are used within the battalion and lower
units and between air and ground troops
c Motorcycle messengers are most efficient over short
distances and are used to a maximum to reduce the amount
of radio traffic
d Liaison officers are the most satisfactory means for
transmitting instructions where time is vital or the situation
is hazy For qualifications and duties of liaison officers and
their methods see FM 0 -5
e Radio communication is available down to include
vehicle commander in platoons of armored units In order
to derive the maximum use of this agency strict radio
discipline is essential Only essential sets are operated and
the maximum use is made of a simple system of prearranged
code messages
f Command and liaison airplanes are utilized to transmit
orders overlays and staff officers when the situation

INDIVIDUAL AND UNIT TRAINING
3 THE SOLDIER -a Man is the final and decisive element
in war Victory is gained through the application of technique
and employment of materiel by troops with high
morale discipline and the will to overcome all obstacles to
attain their objectives (See FM 2 -50 and 2 - 00 ) The
following requirements are essential in developing armored
units whose individuals are capable of superior performances
and confident of their ability to accomplish any mission
assigned
b A high standard of individual training attained by
painstaking and meticulous attention to the smallest details
is necessary to make the soldier mechanically perfect in
handling his weapon vehicle and equipment under all circumstances
Proficiency in these details may mean the
difference between success and failure of an operation and
life and death of the individual
c Emphasis on calisthenics and other forms of physical
exercises is essential to develop the high degree of physical
fitness and stamina necessary for withstanding the prolonged
strain of active campaign
d Each individual must be kept constantly informed of
the purpose of training and of the tactical situation in which
he is engaged Simulation of battle casualties among subordinate
leaders in combat training to allow the soldier to carry
out the mission of the combat team teaches him to accept
similar responsibility in actual warfare Realism in training
including all field exercises must be constantly stressed
by visualization of battle conditions and impressing upon
all the significance of such conditions
e Every opportunity during training will be utilized to
create enthusiasm and interest to stimulate alertness pride
in personal appearance sense of responsibility and to develop
initiative and esprit de corps
â¢ 4 THE LEADER-a The qualities of command leadership
must be developed to a high degree in all grades The ability
to analyze situations basically and quickly to reach sound
decisions and to give expression thereto in concise and
clear orders will be developed in all leaders through frequent
tactical exercises
9
4- 5
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
b Initiative must be demanded in all grades Mental
alertness and aggressiveness and ability to think act and
quickly take advantage of tactical opportunities must be
developed to the highest degree In the absence of orders
each individual must use his judgment and act in accordance
with the tactical situation in furtherance of the general
mission
c A sense of duty which subordinates personal consideration
to the welfare of the unit or group and a will to accept
personal hazards and prolonged intensive effort in the execution
of orders must be demanded
d Leaders must always be well forward to receive early
information of the situation make their estimate announce
their decision and issue orders personally to the subordinate
commanders
e Leaders must understand and appreciate the thoughts
and problems of their troops They must make every effort
to provide timely necessities insure rest and protect their
troops from unnecessary hazards
f Leaders must require strict and complete obedience and
demand the maximum measure of sacrifice from their units
when necessary to insure victory
0 5 THE UNIT -a The primary training objective of each
unit will be the early development of an efficient hardstriking
unit which is prepared to take the field at short
notice at existing strength and capable of conducting combined
operations against an enemy equipped with modern
means of warfare
b Success in battle depends upon the coordinated employment
of all available arms and technique applicable to the
situation This coordination is only obtained through painstaking
combined training of highly trained individuals and
units Tactical flexibility is based on the ability to exact
definite and rigid standards of performance from individuals
and units committed to action
c Men are grouped into units with a view to their training
for and use in combat Individuals constantly trained
quartered and fed together develop a feeling of solidarity
which must be furthered by the greatest degree of-permanence
being given to squad and platoon assignments (See
FM 00-5 )

SECTION I
GENERAL
â 25 GENERAL DOCTRINE -a The tactical employment of armored
force units is based upon the doctrine set forth in
FM 00-5 and chapter of this manual Their characteristics
favor the striking of quick hard blows
b Armored units should be assigned missions which their
characteristics are designed to accomplish and except in
emergencies should not be assigned missions that other
available troops can perform satisfactorily
c Since tanks furnish the striking power of armored units
it is necessary to understand and keep constantly in mind
their capabilities and limitations in the assignment of missions
(See ch 5 )
d The capabilities are-
( ) High road speed : 35 to 40 mph
(2) Ability to move cross country at speeds up to 25 mph
in especially favorable terrain
(3) Ability to cross small obstacles ditches and shallow
streams
(4) Ability to pass through thin woods and brush
(5) Great fire power
(6) Crushing ability to overrun personnel materiel and
equipment
(7) Armor protection for crew
e The limitations are-
( ) Cannot cross deep or soft-bottomed streams marshy
ground or swamps
(2) Cannot cross wide ditches or other large obstacles

( ) Necessity for periodic maintenance
26 TERRAIN AND WEATHER -a The terrain exercises an
important and often decisive influence in tactical situations
It may be the determining factor in the decision to employ
armored units on a specified mission or not Generally the
terrain will determine the tactical form of an attack and the
ground over which the main attack will be launched
b A thorough appreciation of terrain and Its effect on
operations is essential to the proper command and employment
of all armored units Areas most favorable for their
employment are determined from : the study of maps reconnaissance
agencies higher and adjacent units troops already
in contact with the enemy and personal reconnaissance by
the leader or his staff
c Gently rolling open terrain with occasional lightly
wooded areas affording some cover and facilities for observation
is the most favorable for operations of armored units
Desirable terrain is that which provides covered routes of
approach positions for supporting units and permits the
maximum use of the speed and maneuverability of armored
vehicles
d Terrain broken by natural obstacles such as unfordable
streams ravines or streams with steep banks marshes cliffs
dense woods closely spaced boulders or stumps forces armored
units either to make long detours or follow canalized
routes limiting their maneuverability choice of direction
and method of attack
e Rough hilly or mountainous terrain reduces the speed

of armored troops to almost that of dismounted troops or
else restricts their movements to roads Armored troops
when restricted to roads and defiles unless frequent ""turnarounds""
are available are particularly vulnerable to attack
by hostile aircraft and to antitank weapons
f Armored units avoid defended towns or cities when possible
except when they can be surprised Such localities
are attacked by motorized infantry or other closely following
troops
g Unfavorable weather may materially affect operations
of armored force units Rain mud ice and snow may impede
limit or prevent the employment of armored units
Extremes of temperature adversely affect both materiel and
personnel However inclement weather may prove advantageous
to the troops inured to hardships
â 27 COVER AND CONCEALMENT --a The discovery of unusual
numbers of tank units in a given area is an indication of
a probable major operation in that vicinity The concealment
of vehicles therefore is important at all times particularly
from aerial observation and photography Partial
concealment is of little or no value Every practicable effort
must be made to provide complete concealment
b Camouflage is work done to provide concealment of
materiel troops or military works from enemy air or ground
observers To be effective camouflage must be supervised by
personnel thoroughly familiar with its principles and methods
The means employed are nets paulins paint earth branches
and grass The fundamental rules of camouflage are covered
in detail in FM 5-20 and 2 -45
c Personnel of armored units must be thoroughly instructed
in the use of natural means of camouflage available
and be required to apply habitually these means to conceal
themselves and vehicles
d The following rules governing concealment should b ;
known and understood by all :
( ) Natural concealment should be sought before resorting
to camouflage ; it is simpler requires less time skill and
material and is more effective Concealment of bivouacs
is much simpler in woods and villages than in the open
Vehicles are best concealed by placing them under heavy
natural cover as in dense woods In partly open country
7
2 7
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
they should be driven into thin woods or clumps of trees or
brush
(2) Camouflage should not be overdone A small amount
of material judiciously employed is frequently more effective
than a mass of material Branches of trees brush weeds
leaves grass or dirt are usually available to cover tents and
vehicles that are partially or wholly exposed Irregular
patches of different material are better than solid blankets
of any one kind
(3) The worst enemies of concealment are straight lines
regularity of pattern angles and shadows * Therefore ingenuity
must be exercised to change or break the outline or
regularity of the pattern of the object being camouflaged
Shelter tents in bivouacs and vehicles in parks or assembly
areas should always be placed in scattered irregular formations
(4) An aerial observer cannot see an object within a
shadow ; neither will an aerial photograph of the locality
reveal it Even a partial shadow crossing the object makes
recognition difficult from the air Therefore natural concealment
can be obtained by halting vehicles within shadows
(5) Care should be taken that track imprints do not
disclose the location of vehicles Tracks may be obliterated
by covering them with brush leaves or dirt or by dragging
over them with branches or some other means The enemy
may be further deceived by running one or more vehicles
beyond the true entrance to the area and obliterating the
actual entrance In entering woods fewer tracks will have
to be obliterated if vehicles enter in column and scatter after
getting under cover Also in dense woods care should be
taken not to knock down any more trees than absolutely
necessary and then straighten up those that have been
knocked down
(6) Making paths within bivouac to concealed vehicles
should be avoided unless such paths are concealed from air
observation
(7) When foliage is used to cover vehicles and other equipment
it should be renewed daily Wilted leaves and
branches will appear different in color from natural surroundings
when observed or photographed from the air
Care should also be taken in gathering natural camouflage
to avoid denuding the ground in the immediate vicinity of

the object being camouflaged Fresh dirt should be covered
with brush leaves or grass
(8) No rubbish of any kind should be allowed to accumulate
about a bivouac
(9) Fire or smoke should not be permitted near vehicles
( 0) Ruins provide one of the best means of concealment
( ) At night necessary lights are concealed
( 2) If natural concealment is not available vehicles
halted in the open should seek very broken ground folds in
the ground etc Natural or artificial me",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BATTLE ORDER.
Regiment .
27 .
The Tank invent can attack with two battalions'
one behind the other in two waves) or =one, alongside the ,other . K
If the Regiment is fighting within the Brigade, _the,. :
latter decides the battle order .
28.
The attack by the Regiment-in waves strikes - the-enemy
a blow the weight of which is continually maintained ""by --the
ompanies of the rear wave . This makes a battle. in depth
possible .
Formation in depth is .the best protection of the
flank of a regiment fighting in the enemy's . zone of resistance .
The attack in waves facilitates the control of the
Regiment .
It - is .the rule .
29 .
Action with two battalions: side side aid with .
little depth may be useful in the pursuit of an-already :
weakened enemy, or whenn breaking off action in order to
(counter) -attack a pursuing enemy .
30.
If the Regiment w ants. to concentrate the forces of
battalions fighting side by side towards the centre, it orders
""central line"" (advance on one axis) .
31 .
The Regimental omme.rnerr moves in front of the
Regiment, till he has ascertained that the first wave has
attacked in the direction ordered .
He then-takes his position
as far in front as will ensure him a good view - of .the action
of the first wave and enable him to influence the action of the
second wave .
If the Regiment disposes of three battalions (Abteilungen),
the third battalion can be employed as a second or third

For the attack, the TankBattalion forms up in sevaral
lines, the composition of which depends upon the position of the
enemy, the task, the . width of the available space, the field of
view and the position of the Battalion in the battle order of
the Regiment .
As a rule the light companies make ., up the first line ;
the medium company usually fights in the so c and . line so as to
provide covering fire for the light companies . The third
light company follows in the third line either behind the
exposed flank or behind the centre of gravity .

When attacking from the â¢move` it is essentiall to'.'.strike
the enemy quickly and by surprise without splitting up one -'s
own forces .
To form battle order, a halt 'for forming up is
usually necessary . This must be done under the best possible
cover from enemy observation and weapons . It must be carried
out quickly -so as to leave the enemy no time to prepare his
anti-tank weapons . The readier the unit was during deployment,,
the shorter the halt for forming up will be
39.
Unexpected encounters with the enemy or ground
-conditions (for instance flghtirg one' s way out o f a' de file) may
necessitate an attack from column of march or from narrow battle
formation. As soon as the leading tanks have cleared room for
the deployment of the tanks 'following, 'and as . soon as the .ground
end the enemy situation permit,, battle order .must be taken Up .

41.
When attacking from the move,, the regiment usually
brings up its battalions in line . In that case it is the task
of the first wave to smash the enemy and penetrate as deeply ,as
possible .
+
The second wave is brought up in such a manner that
it can go into action from depth. The ' battle objectives will
often only become clear during . the course of . the attack .
42,
lose liaison during the attack : with the ommander of the
co-operating artillery is of particular importance as, when
attacking from the move
I
there will be' little information about

The artillery must-be . informed, of the,, attack orders,

The Pioneer Section and attached elements of the
Armoured Pioneer Battalion are often attached to the first wave .

As soon as the Battalion ommander `receives the :,rder

The Artillery ommanderandObserver will accompany .,_
the attack of the foremost elements in the O. P. Tank and, at the
request of the Battalion ommander, will direct 'artillery' fire
chiefly against those :enemy weapons which are . not dealt with by,:,â¢
the attack of the battalion . . If, in exceptional cases' a
battery of artillery -must co-operate with a tank :battalion, fire
control is also exercised by artilllieairsyonn headquarters .

Before moving up to the point of assembly,,the approach
roads and , the assembly point must be reconnoitred., . They must
provide cover from enemy ground and air observation . . , The'
assembly -point should, if possible, also be within reach of tha
wheeled vehicles necessary for supply.
50.
At assembly point the Regiment forms up for the attack
as far as space and ground .will permit and prepares for . action .
51 .
All preparations necessary for the launching of the
attack must be made . Amongst these are :
- .Thorough reconnaissance of the ground to be attacked ..,
- Removal of blocks and obstacles in front of the main
enemy battla position . ;
- Obtaining of all information necessary for ; the attack
by means of close reconnaissance . -
I
- Establishment of liaison with the ommanders o f
supporting and accompanying weapons . .
- Establishment pf .liaison with the commanders' of
formations and units which are already in contact' with
the enemy in the area of attack .
- Under certain circumstances, establishment of liaison
with the-commanders . of infantry and rifle formations
which attack before the armoured formations.
The results of the recoiuihissance by all arms and all
weapons of located enemy centres of resistance ~ especially their
anti-tank weapons and artillery, must be exploited .
52 .
The picture .of the ground over which the - attack i is to
take place should be painted to ompany ommanders and as many
subordinate commanders as possible I provided that' by sb doing
the intention to attack is not given away (to the enamy) . .
Wireless silence at the assembly point will be
observed, so that the enemy can get no inkling :of an impending .
tank attack through increased WIT activity .
54.
The armoured formations should be moved from assembly
point in battle 'order . - If the ground does not permit thisi
a short halt for forming up will also be required when attacking
from the ready positions
Regiment.
55 .
If the Regiments attacks in several waves, thefirst
wave will usually be ordered quickly to gene trate deep into the
main enemy_. battle position and to destroy' the enemy artillery .
The secondwave, which follows immediately, will'
overpower those enemy infantry and heavy weapons which have not
been smashed by the . attack of the first wave . In simultaneous
attacks - with- riflemen and infantry, the second wave enables the
former to .follaw up quickly -to exploit succe$#
66 .
If the Regiment is .ordered to helpforward the attack
of infantry or riflemen, the commander of the tank regiment is
responsible for the maintenance of touch between his raiment
and the riflemen . The Regiment details certain of its elements,
usually only up to the strength of a light company, for direct .
co-operation with or attachment. to the riflemen . .
J? . The Regimental ommas der can detail the second wave
to bring up its medium tank ;compaziy: .;to reinforce the covering
fire for- the penetration of~`the ~fir'st wave .
In this case, it
is not usually necessary to attach this company to the first
w aye .
58 . After successful penetration, the assault must be
quickly carried on deep into he main enemy battle position .
This is the quickest . and safest way - of breaking the enemy' s
resistance .
59 .
if parts of the anti-tankbattalion are . attached to the
regiment, they form up in several waves immediately behind the
first wave so as to assist it in overpowering the enemy anti-tank
weapons during the penetration . After, penetration, they are
usually brought up behind the exposed flank off the first'wave . in
such a. manner that they can support it in an encounter with enemy
tanks and also eov?r the flank of the regiment,
60. lose co-operation with the Pioneers who accompany the
attack in pioneer tanks is. essential to ensure the quick removal
of all A .F .V . blocks and . _obstacles w- hich-might hold up the attack
deep into the main enemy battle position. During the removal of
obstacles protection_ of the pioneers by tanks may. â¢be necessary .

When attacking in .waves , the""Battalion â¢,of, ths= first wave
will, ass long as it i.s not engaged in_.,fighting the enemy anti-tank.
weapons, also engage located' heavy enemy we anons and centres :of.
resistancet but this, must not, cause .deviation 'fr.om the accomplishment
of the main tasks.
After having reached -the -objective , of- .- the ;;,attack, the
ommander immediately organises the Battalion in, the' necessary
battle formation for further .action . Enemyw counter attacks must
=always find the Battalion-,ready: to attack : (in-+turn) . :
In the second wave' the . medium :.componf, which will' be
the support for the first wave, is to be kept well up',-.w ith the
latter . This effectively provides for covering fire .'-for the
light companies 'against -anti-tank weapons ., which have-;not been
located or overpowered by the first wave, The light' companies
.must seek-out and destroy any,,enemy,'not. destroyed by the first

lose range attacks by the enemy, chiefly using Molotov

resistance ; certain ground conditions ; limited visibility ;

"tank can carry. Putting heavy
armour on a tank, in the present stage of development of firearms forces the enemy
197
to employ a big anti-tank gun. The larger the anti-tank gun the more difficult it is
to conceal. The larger the gun the more complicated is the problem of ammunition
supply, both in regard to provision and transport, and this in turn legislates against
the employment of a fully automatic weapon. On balance the principle of the
Infantry Tank, at the present stage of development of firearms is tactically sound.
Characteristics of the Anti-Infantry and Anti-Tank Weapon. The
defensive power of the machine gun is probably the most emphatic lesson of the
War 1914-18. Sustained fire confers on the machine gun its great stopping power
and inconspicuousness makes it extraordinarily light in weight and mechanization
of first line transport will enable large quantities to be placed at gun positions.
Even when blinded by darkness, dust or smoke the ability to fire on a fixed line
makes the machine gun a formidable anti-infantry weapon. The number of
machine guns now included in the organization of every first class army will
enable all important fixed lines to be tripled or quadrupled by guns firing from
widely dispersed positions. The number of machine guns available will make it
possible to allot individual guns small arcs of fire and this further assists
concealment.
If we include the divisional field artillery, the proportion of anti-tank guns
to anti-infantry guns in most modern armies is about one to six. As the divisional
field artillery is primarily intended for other purposes than anti-tank defence this
basis of comparison really favours the anti-tank weapon. If comparison is made
on the basis of projectiles delivered per minute, the numerical strength of antiinfantry
defence is overwhelmingly greater than anti-tank defence. Because of the
comparative scarcity of primary anti-tank weapons, individual guns must be
allotted wide arcs of fire. The size of the gun and the present necessity for a wide
arc of fire make concealment a much more difficult problem than is the case with
the machine gun. The big anti-tank gun cannot fire on a fixed line  it must fire
an aimed shot and must be able to see its target. Therefore conditions of bad
visibility are a much greater handicap to the anti-tank gun than they are to the
machine gun.
The machine gun possesses advantages over its target  the infantry,
which the anti-tank gun does not possess over its target  the tanks.
The Influence of Smoke. The writer is of the opinion that they advantages
of the use of smoke in the attack have been grossly exaggerated. In the form of
direct covering fire, within the area where the assault is taking place, it may assist
infiltration through gaps in the defence but gaps will not exist unless they have
been created by lethal covering fire. Assuming the defenders to be of good
morale, the man lying in wait in his weapon pit until a target looms through the
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
198
The Attack
smoke actually has an advantage over the man groping his way blindly through
obscurity, his sense of direction lost and knowing where to look for his enemy.
Smoke will not stop the machine gun firing on fixed lines. It will neutralize the
anti-tank gun but will also neutralize the tank which will be unable to see to use
its weapons.
Smoke can assist the attack if employed beyond the immediate objective,
to shut out observation and neutralize anti-tank guns sited in depth to fire into the
area being attacked. Used in this manner smoke can completely neutralize a
proportion of the anti-tank guns which depend upon aimed fire to stop their
opponent. It will not stop the machine gun firing on a fixed line.
Bearing in mind the above limitations, smoke affords a greater degree of
protection to attacking tanks than to attacking infantry.
The Influence of Gas. Neither tanks nor infantry are likely to be seriously
handicapped by choking gas. An area contaminated with blister gas will not stop
attacking infantry because its effect is delayed but it may cause heavy casualties.
Tanks can pass through a contaminated area with impunity. In attacking an enemy
who employs gas, tanks are less likely to suffer casualties than infantry.
Counter Attack. Infantry are very vulnerable if exposed to an immediate
counter-attack by tanks before they have had time to organize consolidation.
Tractor drawn anti-tank guns (whether manned by gunners or infantry-men) are
not suitable for employment on the move in the forefront of the battle. Therefore,
for protection against hostile tanks, infantry must depend upon accompanying
friendly tanks which mount an anti-tank gun. A difficult problem (which is
discussed below) arises when attacking across an anti-tank obstacle.
Tanks have the weapons to stop a hostile immediate counter-attack by
tanks and/or infantry. Infantry can stop a hostile immediate counter-attack by
infantry but their ability to stop tanks in the first few moments of reaching an
objective is, at best, very doubtful.
Economic Considerations. It is sometimes argued that infantry are much
less expensive than tanks and for a long time we have been in danger of
developing a mentality that considers tanks so valuable that they must not be
risked in battle unless conditions are exceptionally favourable. Fire is the
predominant factor in modern war.1 Therefore it is fair to take fire power as the
basis of comparison between infantry and tanks. Aplatoon of say twenty-five men
develops slightly less fire power than a five man tank mounting three machine
guns, smoke projectors and an anti-tank gun. The average man in this country by
the time he has attained the age of 18 has cost $5,700.2 It is worth noting that in
199
general this is the age at which a youth ceases to be a liability and goes to work
and becomes an asset to the national economy. Aplatoon of twenty-five average
men is worth at least $142,500 without taking into consideration the value of their
arms and equipment. The crew of a five man tank will be worth $28,500. This
leaves a credit balance of $114,000 with which to purchase their equipment. It is
very difficult to state the value of a tank. It depends upon the number ordered.
The mass production car that markets for $800-$900 would cost $10,000 to
$12,000 custom built. But it is certain that for $114,000 any government could
buy a mass production tank of the type required and still have a balance in hand
to contribute towards its running expenses.
A counter argument has been developed on the lines that with the tank, all
the eggs are in one basket whilst with the platoon they are well distributed over
the ground. But the dispersal of the eggs must be considered in relation to the
proportion of projectiles capable of destroying them and it has been pointed out
above that in this respect the chances of survival of the tank are considerably
better than those of the infantry-man. Further, a disabled tank has salvage value
and even if completely destroyed, apart from its crew, the loss entailed does not
exceed its original cost. Dead men have no salvage value. Dependents of killed
and disable soldiers must be pensioned and become charges against the State.
Infantry is not cheap. Its man power is a nations greatest asset. It takes about
eighteen years to make a man. Once mass production has been organized, tanks
can be run off the assembly lines at the rate of hundreds per month.
From the point of view of national economy, the tank is a cheaper
assaulting arm than infantry.
The Influence of Obstacles. It is its ability to surmount almost any type
of obstacle (providing the obstacle is not covered by sustained fire) which confers
on infantry a characteristic possessed by no other arm. The statement often made
that infantry cannot assault in face of the modern machine gun defence is not
supported by facts. Given sufficient fire support infantry made successful assaults
on the most highly organized defences during the War 1914-18. It is probable that
in a future war, an enemy acting on the defensive will make full use of anti-tank
obstacles as the Germans did during their retreat in 1918. On occasions it will be
possible to pass assaulting tanks across an obstacle by some mechanical means
and this opens an interesting and profitable field for attaining tactical surprises in
the future. But there will be many cases where an obstacle is of a type that cannot
be overcome by a mechanical device and those who believe that infantry can no
longer assault, when faced with such a situation, will have no alternative but to
follow their counsels of despair and admit that they are beaten. Until infantry have
secured a bridgehead it will not be possible to build a bridge and pass tanks across
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
200
The Attack
and this presents a difficult and important problem that has received too little
attention. The anti-tank gun is not a weapon which fits conveniently into a boat.
Without the support of tanks or anti-tank guns the infantry will have great
difficulty in maintaining a bridgehead in face of counter-attacks by hostile tanks.
The amphibious tank has been suggested as a possible solution, but in the writers
opinion the amphibious tank is a poor weapon. To be buoyant, armour protection
must be pared down until the vehicle in fact ceases to be a tank and becomes an
unarmoured gun platform too big to take advantage of cover that would conceal
an anti-tank gun of conventional design. A type of inflatable flotation gear is
required for the anti-tank gun and should form part of its regular war equipment.
Once across an obstacle, the gun can be man-handled by its detachment until its
tractor can be moved across but the carriage of ammunition will require special
fatigue parties.
In a comparison of artificial obstacles, the barbed wire entanglement is
cheaper, lighter and more compact in transit and quicker and easier to construct
than any obstruction capable of stopping a tank.
Excepting the barbed wire entanglement, obstacles place a much greater
restriction upon the movements of tanks than they do upon the movements of
infantry.
Covering Fire. Covering fire may take the form of stationary
concentrations on selected areas or of a moving barrage. Doctrine states: A
barrage is the simplest and most effective method of giving support when it is not
possible to locate enemy positions with accuracy and further When the enemy
dispositions are known in considerable detail, it may be effective and also
economical of resources to employ concentrations of fire on selected areas 3
(My Italics). It is not likely that enemy dispositions will be known with
accuracy and in considerable detail except under conditions of static warfare
and then the extent of information will amount to the knowledge that certain
positions are occupied by the enemy  the complete enemy layout will never be
known when an attack is launched. Our defence doctrine severely deprecates the
siting of even hasty defences in exposed and obvious positions. It emphasises that
when there is not time to construct field defences, concealment is of primary
importance. So does the doctrine of every first class army and many foreign
armies do more than pay lip service to the use of camouflage. Yet our most
common form of attack training exercise proceeds something along these lines: -
After reconnaissance troops have been held up for a short time by machine guns
firing over open fields of fire, infantry are launched to the assault supported by
concentrations on selected areas. The positions of hostile centres of resistance are
presumably located with accuracy by some divinely inspired sixth sense
201
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
202
possessed by the commander of the reconnaissance troops. If this is tried in war
against a first class enemy the answer will be a large number of infantry casualties
at $5,700 per head. If there are gaps in the defence the reconnaissance troops will
discover them. If there are no gaps  if it is a continuous position with
interlocking fire from mutually supporting localities  even if the position lacks
depth the crust will not be broken by infantry unless supported by a barrage.
Tanks are immune to machine gun fire or shell splinters. They can operate
within a machine gun barrage and in the rear edge  the splinter zone  of a H.E.
artillery barrage. The occasional short shell is unlikely to do tanks serious harm.
For these reasons they can take better advantage of covering fire than can
infantry.
The Main Assaulting Arm. Aconsideration of the foregoing factors shows
that in a comparison between the assaulting power of tanks and infantry with the
one exception of ability to cross certain types of obstacles, every advantage is in
favour of tanks. It follows that on every occasion when the ground permits of their
employment, tanks should fill the role of the main assaulting arm. This is not to
say that infantry cannot assault if they are given adequate artillery support and
providing the enemy have not erected wire. But they will do so at a greater cost
and the depth to which they will be able to penetrate will be much more limited
than if tanks are employed.
Assisted by the neutralizing effect of artillery and machine gun support,
tanks can close the enemy defences until they can see the hostile posts and engage
them at decisive short range. Armoured protection puts the tank crew on an equal
footing with the defenders behind earthworks or even concrete. At short range
they can destroy or neutralize the perimeter defences of hostile localities. But they
cannot destroy the enemy who, on the approach of tanks may take cover in wood,
buildings, weapon pits or dugouts, only to man their weapons again as soon as the
tanks move away. Therefore to destroy or capture the enemy the co-operation of
infantry is essential. Under the cover provided by the tanks infantry can enter
hostile localities and deliver the coup de grace.
The bickering between the Advanced Tank School and the Reactionary
Infantry School should cease, for successful attack in the future depends upon
cooperation between these arms. Infantry, instead of practicing unrealistic attacks
supported by a battery firing a concentration and fighting their way forward with
their own weapons over open fields of fire, should study seriously the problem
of working with tanks. To the riposte frequently heard: What are you going to
do when you havent got tanks? there is only one reply. What are you going to
do in modern war without machine guns, artillery, ammunition, gas masks or
The Attack
203
aeroplanes?
IV  Framing of Attack Situations
It is unfortunate that most of our training for the attack has been framed
in the setting of the Encounter Battle. For the Encounter Battle  the head-on
collision between two forces going in opposite directions  presupposes a faulty
appreciation by one side or the other. Both sides cannot hold the initiative. It is
interesting to note that the encounter battle has formed the build-up for tactical
training mainly since the Franco-Prussian war when the French made a deplorably
faulty appreciation. It has continued since the war 1914-18, when again, the initial
French Plan XVII was based upon entirely faulty premises. In act, taking history
as a basis, the encounter is generally fought out by the mobile troops. By that
time, the situation has become clarified and there is little doubt as to which side
possessed the initiative. Information from the air and from his cavalry decided Sir
John French to halt and defend the line of the Mons-Conde Canal although
original plans required the B.E.F. to advance on the left wing of the French
Armies  there was no head-on collision between advanced guards of main
columns. After the Marne the initiative passed to the French and British and the
B.E.F. followed the retiring Germans who covered their withdrawal by mobile
troops. The encounter battle as envisaged in many training exercises can only take
place if one side has made a thoroughly bad appreciation, including a
miscalculation of the time and space factor.
Let us examine the probable action of a well trained enemy assuming that
our side holds the initiative. The mobile troops of most modern armies consist of
a mixture of light armoured fighting vehicles and troops carried in mechanical
transport intended primarily to be employed in dismounted action. The first
contact will be with patrols from enemy mobile troops sent forward to gain
information  to confirm air reports as to the direction and frontage of our
advance. Out-manoeuvring and driving in these patrols will be the task of our own
mobile troops. Such hostile patrols may test our strength and gain a little time by
blocking and holding the crossings over obstacles. If hostile patrols are only
strong enough to hold actual crossings, the dismounted element of our own mobile
troops may cross at intervening points and drive off detachments covering bridges.
But at times it may happen that our own mobile troops are extended on such a
wide front, that though they can find the gap, they have not the strength to exploit
it. It will then be necessary to deploy some of the leading infantry. On these
occasions the situation will not be such that infantry are called upon to attack
frontally a position which the mobile troops have been unable to penetrate. The
situation will require the crossing of an obstacle at a place unguarded by the
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
204
enemy, an advance on the far side with all round protection and manoeuvre to
reach a position in rear of an enemy standing patrol from which fire can be
brought to bear upon it at close range. In country that is closely wooded, or
intersected by many streams or canals, a few standing patrols might hold up
mechanized mobile troops for long periods and under these conditions it may be
necessary to call on the assistance of infantry at frequent intervals. Infantry could
be unleashed across or through obstacles to clear the way. The action required
of the infantry will necessitate tactics of manoeuvre and infiltration through close
country, not an attack with a set piece fire plan.
The next stage arises when our mobile troops come in contact with a
hostile covering force sent forward to gain time. The tactical handling of a
covering force is exactly the same as that of a rearguard, the ruling principle of
which is the maintenance of an intact front at the sacrifice of depth. Whenever
our mobile troops make contact with the enemy, if trained according to principles
laid down by doctrine, they will fan out to the flanks and explore the extent of
the hostile position. The first intimation our mobile troops will get that they are
no longer opposed by patrols, but by a covering force, will be the discovery that
they are up against an intact front. If through a tactical error on the part of the
enemy there is a gap in the hostile front, trained mobile troops will discover it. If
the gap exists on the group over which tanks can operate, the armoured vehicles
of the mobile troops will be better fitted to exploit it than infantry, for the situation
will require a rapid advance through the gap and subsequent operations against the
flanks and rear of the enemy on one or both sides. If our artillery is properly
handled, any support available to infantry within two hours will be available to the
mobile troops. If the gap is blocked by an anti-tank obstacle, then it will be
necessary to call upon the forward infantry, but once again the tactics required of
infantry will be exactly the same as those against patrols outlined above. But we
cannot work on the assumption that the enemy are going to make mistakes or that
they do not know their business well enough to provide a covering force adequate
to the frontage to be covered. And one up against an intact front, with interlocking
fire, it is a useless waste of life to launch infantry to the assault without adequate
fire support and adequate fire support means a barrage. If it is essential to the
commanders plan that the hostile covering forces be driven-in quickly, then
leading formations must be reinforced with infantry tanks and senior commanders
must be well forward so that they are able to make an early decision as to where
the enemy position is to be broken and concentrate their artillery and tanks to
break it. Several independent company and battalion battles launched on a
divisional front will meet with the repulses that lack of coordination and
concentration always deserve.
Let us hold to realism. The object of training is not to prove that Infantry
The Attack
205
is the Queen of Battles but to teach cooperation between the many varied fighting
troops which are the essential components of a modern army.
V  Summary of Conclusions
It is not the intention of this article to be one of destructive criticism, but
it is felt very strongly that the lines upon which our training for the attack have
been based during the last few years are unrealistic in the extreme. Official and
unofficial histories and records of the War 1914-18 will be searched in vain for
examples of successful attacks staged on the lines of the majority of training
exercises. The writer has been able to discover three examples of successful
attacks of this type but they took place during the Third Afghan War.
In conclusion of the preceding arguments the following is a summary of
the suggestions in regard to training for the attack:-
(a) Attacks by infantry and tanks in cooperation
should be considered the normal, not the abnormal, method of
attack. By far the most important subject for study and training
is the cooperation between infantry and infantry tanks. Since
the close of the War in 1918 this has become almost an
unexplored field. There has been tremendous progress in tank
design and cooperation cannot be achieved without training as
was proved in the last Great War. This is not just a problem for
higher commanders. It is equally a problem for infantry platoon
and tank section commanders, for infantry section leaders and
tank crews.
(b) Barring cooperation with tanks, infantry training
in the attack should be directed to the following studies:-
(i) Forcing the crossing of tank obstacles.
(ii) Exploitation of a gap, requiring an
advance with exposed flanks and infiltration tactics.
(iii) Fighting in close country, woods and
villages.
(iv) Night attacks.
This is not a criticism of doctrine  the reader is challenged to find a
statement that conflicts with our doctrine as applied to modern organization. It is
a criticism of misinterpretation of doctrine. Before the outbreak of the War in
GUY SIMONDS AND THE ART OF COMMAND
206

Army has the finest training manuals of any army in the world and makes the
worst use of them. Let us make sure that such a statement cannot be justified
today.

Afterword
The stated purpose of this book is to document the ideas on leadership and
command expressed by Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds while serving as
General Officer Commanding 2nd Canadian Corps. The narrative sections
are designed to place these ideas in context so that the specific challenges
confronting the corps are understood. These descriptive paragraphs are largely
drawn from my book-length studies Fields of Fire: The Canadians in Normandy
and Cinderella Army: The Canadians in Northwest Europe 1944-1945, and
readers who wish to examine the topic further should consult these works. My
reading of the campaign in Normandy and Northwest Europe suggests that at the
corps and army level where the allocation of scarce resources, the formulation of
workable, innovative operational plans and the optimum use of ancillary units
such as the specialized armour of the 79th Armoured Division were critical to
success, command skills were vastly more important than personality
characteristics. By this measure Simonds was the most effective corps
commander in 21 Army Group.
Readers who seek other views on Simonds should consult the
biographical sketches by Graham and Granatstein, as well as the essays in Stephen
J. Harris and Bernd Horn (eds) Generalship and the Art of the Admiral:
Perspectives on Senior Canadian Military Leadership, especially the essay on
Simonds by Roman Jaramowcyz. Bill McAndrew, one of Simonds best-informed
critics, comments on the generals approach to battle in Fire or Movement?
Canadian Tactical Doctrine, Sicily 1943 in Military Affairs July 1987. For a
more favourable assessment from an especially astute observer see John A.
English, The Canadian Army in the Normandy Campaign: A Study of Failure in
High Command. Douglas Delaney discusses Simonds, as well as other Canadian
generals in Looking Back on Canadian Generalship in the Second World War in
Canadian Army Journal volume 7.1, Spring 2004. Delaney is preparing an

important comparative study of the three corps commanders who served under
First Canadian Army: John Crocker, Brian Horrocks and Guy Simonds. Readers
will enjoy C.P. Staceys Canadian Leaders of the Second World War in
Canadian Historical Review, volume 66 March 1985 and his memoir, A Date With
History. For a detailed analysis of Simonds most famous battle, Operation
TOTALIZE, see the model study by Brian Reid, No Holding Back.

"ans available should
be used to disguise their characteristic profile
( 3) Bright or shining parts of material should be covered
with mud or grease
e Concealment in snow is much more difficult than at
other times The following points should be kept in mind :
Trails get tracked with mud and melt out early leaving a
black line ; snow falls through camouflage material and the
holes show dark; the heat of engines and of kitchen ranges
cause early melting of snow This can be remedied by keeping
activity at a minimum when snow first falls ; and by
covering trails vehicles etcâ with fresh snow replacing it
as often as needed
f The noise of running engines particularly those of
tanks can be heard at a considerable distance and will disclose
the presence of concealed tanks to ground observers
Engines therefore should always be stopped as soon as vehicles
have been placed under cover or concealed This
should likewise be done whenever practicable as a means
of conserving fuel
g The following precautions should be observed while
moving to attack or in close proximity to the enemy :
( ) Use all available natural cover whether stationary or
moving
(2) Halt preferably under trees in thickets or in the
shadow of buildings or trees
(3) Choose routes of approach which provide the most
cover and concealment such as ravines draws gulleys or
folds in the ground; avoid skylines
(4) Avoid bottoms where vehicles may be bogged down
and clumps of bushes where sink holes stumps etc may be
encountered
(5) Avoid dense woods ; travel along the edges
9
passing over soft ground stream crossings ditches or similar
obstacles
( 2) If time permits and if considered essential obliterate
tank tracks by dragging suitable objects over them
( 3) When approaching the enemy if the presence of tank
units has been disclosed deception as to direction of attack
and numbers of vehicles may be obtained by running several
tanks back and forth off to a flank
SECTION II
RECONNAISSANCE
â 28 GENERAL -a The purpose of reconnaissance is to gain
information upon which to base strategical maneuvers or
tactical operations
b Information desired may be of the enemy or of the terrain
Information concerning the enemy may include his
location disposition strength organization capabilities
movements attitude equipment and morale Information
concerning the terrain may include character of roads
streams cover and concealment positions bivouac areas and
suitable areas for employment of obstacles
c Responsibility -The commander of each unit is responsible
for maintaining reconnaissance for information that influences
his own operations or which is required of him by the
higher commander The detailed preparation of plans and
orders for reconnaissance is the function of the staff Plans
for the employment of armored force units should be based
on the most careful and detailed reconnaissance practicable
in the time available Every effort must be made to obtain
the information of greatest importance e the essential
elements of information
20
should be expressed in specific questions stating the information
desired such as :
(a) Enemy
Does the enemy occupy position? If so in what
strength? What are his approximate dispositions?
Where is the enemy's reserve?
What is the strength and location of the enemy's advanced
columns?
What supporting weapons does the enemy have?
(b) Terrain
Are certain roads passable for all armored vehicles?
Are certain bridges intact? What is their capacity?
Are-certain terrain features capable of defense by hostile
or friendly troops?
Are obstacles present which affect the plan of attack or
defense?
e Routine information -In addition to the essential elements
of information prescribed by the commander ground
reconnaissance units obtain and report at specified times or
at most practicable time as a matter of routine without additional
orders and in conjunction with the execution of specific
missions information covering the following items :
( ) Route and bridges -Type condition load and traffic
capabilities
(2) Landing ffelds -Location and suitability
(3) Utilities (water sewage electric power communication
railroads docks) -Condition and repair necessary
(4) Supplies -Amounts location type and condition particularly
fuel lubricants and food
(5) Prepared obstacles demolitions mines and contaminated
areas -Location extent means of avoiding

(7) Hostile aircraft -Number of location time type altitude
direction of flight
(8) Hostile ground forces -Location and time of all hostile
contacts giving strength composition and movements with
particular attention to location and movements of hostile
mechanized forces
(9) Friendly troops and miscellaneous Includes friendly
troops within the sphere of action of the reconnaissance unit
and other intelligence data not included in other items pertinent
to the operation such as weather visibility etc
f Sources of information -The sources of information are
varied and include reports from reconnaissance agencies
actual observation of terrain or physical objects information
or intelligence reports procured from other units examination
of inhabitants prisoners documents aerial photographs
maps spies or identifications and summaries from
higher and lower echelons
g Reconnaissance agencies -( ) The execution of the
commander's plan for reconnaissance is the task of the reconnaissance
agencies The reconnaissance agencies and
personnel available to the armored division and its elements
are :
(a) The attached observation squadron
(b) The division reconnaissance battalion which includes
three armored reconnaissance companies and a light armored
(tank) company
(c) An armored reconnaissance company in each armored
(tank) regiment
(d) The reconnaissance platoon in the headquarters company
engineer battalion and reconnaissance and liaison
section in each engineer company
(e) The personal reconnaissance by the commander staff
officers and subordinate commanders
(f) Artillery reconnaissance elements
(g) Scouts and patrols
(2) The reconnaissance agencies and personnel available
to the GHQ reserve tank groups and battalions are :
(a) Reconnaissance platoon in the group and battalion
headquarters companies
22
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
2 8
(b) Personal reconnaissance by the commander staff
officers and subordinate commanders
(c) Scouts and patrols
h Classification -Reconnaissance is usually classified in
accordance with the location of the objective and the phase of
operations as distant close or battle reconnaissance
( ) Distant reconnaissance is the function of the aviation
and the division reconnaissance battalion It seeks to locate
the advanced elements of the enemy forces and maintain contact
with them It procures the information upon which the
strategical and operative decisions and the plans of the high
command are based Distant reconnaissance is dealt with
in FM 00-5
(2) Close reconnaissance is the function of the regimental
reconnaissance companies It seeks to gain more detailed
information for tactical operation such as the location
strength composition and movements of the enemy and a
reconnaissance of the terrain
(3) Battle reconnaissance is a function of all echelons of
the command and must be continuous It includes observation
of all enemy forces engaged in the action and those whose
contact with our principal forces is imminent Both air and
ground troops should seek the location of hostile flanks
changes in hostile dispositions location of hostile artillery
movement of hostile reserves preparation for counterattacks
and indications of a withdrawal
i Plans for the employment of tank units require in addition
to the usual classes of reconnaissance a special type
of battle or tank reconnaissance to determine when where
and how tanks can best be employed Tank reconnaissance
is of particular importance to all commanders of tank units
It is always made prior to an operation and when possible
before orders are issued Information may be obtained by the
regular reconnaissance agencies but will normally be obtained
by personal reconnaissance or by scouts or patrols dispatched
from the tank units in the area over which tanks are to
operate Information of this type must be obtained by GHQ
reserve tank battalions when attached to cavalry or infantry
divisions
j Reconnaissance in force -When hostile resistance is encountered
which cannot be brushed aside flanked or outflanked
by the reconnaissance agencies a reconnaissance in
23
28
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
force may constitute the best method of clearing up an uncertain
situation Troops assigned to this mission may vary
in strength from an armored (tank) company to a reinforced
armored regiment but must be sufficiently strong to accomplish
the mission Their action will usually consist of a local
attack on a limited objective The commander who orders a
reconnaissance in force must consider the possibility that his
intentions or those of the higher commander may thereby
be disclosed He must also be prepared for the eventuality of
the reconnaissance in force bringing on a general engagement
k Zones routes and localities -( ) To avoid duplication
cf effort reconnaissance agencies must be assigned a zone an
axis or route or a locality or area for reconnaissance The
boundaries thereof are not to be construed as limiting the
movements of the units but rather as definite guides as to
areas of responsibility for reconnaissance The maximum
liberty of movement that the situation warrants should be
allowed
(2) When the enemy is disposed on a broad front or
when his location is in doubt a zone of reconnaissance may
be assigned Factors to be considered in determining the
width of the zone of action are the terrain ; the road net;
strength of forces to be employed ; strength disposition and
activity of the enemy ; facilities for communication ; and the
time available
(3) When information indicates the enemy's advance is
by a definite route (or routes) a route (or routes) for reconnaissance
is generally designated
(4) When accurate information has disclosed the presence
of the enemy in a definite area then that locality or area
is assigned for reconnaissance
(5) In large forces such as a division or larger a reconnaissance
line is designated marking the limit of reconnaissance
between the higher and lower unit The subordinate
unit reconnoiters outward to this line the superior unit beyond
it Either may cross the line if necessary During
an advance the reconnaissance line is advanced from day
to day so that prior to the commencement of each march
stage reconnaissance by the division has explored in advance
to a distance equal to at least a day's march
(6) Advance of reconnaissance elements will be regulated
by designation of successive phase lines or objectives which
24
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
23
may be crossed or passed only on orders or in accordance with
a time schedule Lateral communications between reconnaissance
elements is maintained by contact normally on phase
lines or at designated objectives
(7) Reconnaissance phase lines should include easily identified
terrain features such as roads streams railroads or
towns
(8) Observation aviation should know in advance the limits
of reconnaissance for the reconnaissance battalion and the
route of the battalion command post
Coordination -The commander coordinates the employment
of reconnaissance agencies at his disposal He regulates
their employment in such manner that they will
supplement and assist one another Duplication of effort
is avoided by the assignment of reconnaissance missions and
objectives and by informing subordinates concerning reconnaissance
to be executed by agencies of other commanders
m Aggressiveness -Reconnaissance agencies must be active
and aggressive Such missions generally require secrecy of
movement As a rule combat is avoided which is not necessary
for gaining essential information Essential information
'can frequently be obtained only through attack Reconnaissance
units do not hesitate to attack when their
mission requires it
n Reserves -Commanders initiating reconnaissance should
arrange for reserve reconnaissance elements which can be
employed to reinforce or extend reconnaissance to the front
or flanks
o Communications -( ) To insure the prompt and reliable
transmission of the results of reconnaissance the commander
must regulate the establishment and maintenance of
signal communication including the coordination of communication
to be used between air and ground reconnaissance
agencies When there is danger of hostile interception he
may sharply restrict or prohibit the use of radio in the interest
of secrecy
(2) In the employment of ground reconnaissance agencies
the distance they are sent out and the front to be covered
consideration must be given to the sending range of radios
Frequently reconnaissance units particularly divisional reconnaissance
will be out beyond direct radio communication
with their commanders Under such circumstances informa-
2 5
28
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
tion will have to be transmitted by airplane through pick-up
messages or relayed by radio through air-ground nets or
reconnaissance nets of lower units
(a) A liaison type airplane working with the division reconnaissance
if practicable will speed up transmission without
interfering with missions of other agencies or utilizing their
radio sets which are needed for transmitting information
that they have obtained
(b) Shuttling of command cars until they are within radio
range or even dispatching motorcycle messengers may be
used as expedients but have obvious disadvantages Motorcycle
messengers may however be utilized expeditiously for
short distances between elements of the divisional or regimental
reconnaissance units
(c) Provision should be made in the regimental reconnaissance
unit for listening in on the divisional reconnaissance
net
p Instructions -( ) Instructions for the execution of reconnaissance
in large units may be issued in the form of an
intelligence annex (see FM 30-5 and 0 -5) In small units
they may be included in the field order or be issued separately
in complete or fragmentary form as instructions for reconnaissance
(2) Instructions to reconnaissance agencies should include
in addition to the mission and essential elements of information
the following :
(a) Time of departure
(b) Zone areas or route
(c) Objectives and time to be reached
(d) Duration
(e) Reconnaissance phase lines and time to be crossed
(I) Instructions concerning adjacent reconnaissance units
(g) Instruction for the transmission of reports or time
reports are desired
(h) Instructions about communication with observation
aviation
(i) Time of departure route and objectives of main force
(3) In the absence of instructions each unit executes the
reconnaissance necessary to its own operations within its own
zone of action and toward any exposed flanks

0 29 EXECUTION OF RECONNAISSANCE -a Distant reconnaissance
-The speed and mobility of armored troops and of a
mobile enemy requires air and ground reconnaissance forces
to operate at great distances from the main body (See fig )
( ) Air -(a) Distant reconnaissance by air will be wide
and deep and is usually conducted beyond the sphere of action
of friendly ground forces It will never be less than the operating
range of hostile armored forces or the equivalent of
a day's march for the division that is from 00 to 50 miles
It will normally be initiated prior to the establishment of
contact between ground forces and is under control of the
commander of the armored force unit
(b) Time the ever increasing depth of zone to be observed
and the fact that available aircraft are seldom adequate to
perform all the missions desired precludes detailed reconnaissance
of areas off the main roads Initially ""search""
missions to locate the enemy concentrations and to provide
early information of the enemy's dispositions and movements
are the most important Primarily they should be confined
to the main routes or probable localities The commanders
of armored units also need information as to the condition
of roads bridges defiles and general terrain features many
miles ahead in order to guide their fast moving columns and
to direct their reconnaissance elements in the right direction
avoiding unnecessary detailed reconnaissance This is known
as route reconnaissance Other missions i e surveillance
tracking or photographic may be assigned It is important
however that the priority of missions be specified in the orders
or instructions
(c) The tactics and technique of air reconnaissance and
observation are contained in FM -20
(2) Ground -(a) Since effective reconnaissance cannot be
made at the rate of march of the division reconnaissance
elements should be pushed out sufficiently far in advance of
the division to insure the timely receipt of information by the
division commander In an initial advance prior to contact
with the enemy the divisional reconnaissance may precede
the division by as much as 00 miles and usually is sent out
to 2 days in advance of the main body
(b) When the division is moving under cover of darkness
reconnaissance should be pushed out during daylight hours
to a line beyond the expected bivouac location of the division

A line of observation is established during the hours of darkness
to warn of the movement of hostile troops that might
interfere with the march or bivouac of the division
(c) In other situations reconnaissance should be sent out
sufficiently early to gain their distance in front of the main
body and have at their disposal the time necessary for
reconnaissance
(d) The divisional reconnaissance battalion may be required
to cover a perimeter of as much as 50 miles Detailed
reconnaissance of such a large area is usually impracticable
The usual objectives are principal terrain features critical
points or areas and hostile main forces previously indicated
by observation aviation The assignment of broad frontages
for reconnaissance necessarily will restrict in detail the information
that can be expected and may result in gaps between
adjacent elements
(e) In general the breadth of zone for the battalion should
not exceed from 30 to 50 miles It is determined by the situation
location strength and composition of the enemy the
road net and terrain and the mission of the main body
(f) Each reconnaissance platoon can reconnoiter in average
terrain a front of about 5 to 7'/2 miles in width while advancing
a t the rate of approximately 2 to 5 miles per hour
Assigning two platoons to reconnaissance and one to reserve
in each reconnaissance company will enable the battalion to
reconnoiter on a 30-mile front while the division is moving
Initially one reconnaissance company may be held in reserve
If the rate of advance is decreased the width of reconnaissance
can be correspondingly increased
(g) When contact is gained the divisional reconnaissance
battalion seeks to locate enemy dispositions including his
flanks and favorable ground for an assembly position for the
attack The methods used by the reconnaissance platoon and
company are discussed in chapter 4
(h) The ground reconnaissance agencies work in close cooperation
with the aviation which will furnish some positive
information and a very large amount of negative information
Ground agencies will develop the information that requires
verification and verify and amplify the positive information
When the aviation is prevented from getting information
because of weather conditions or hostile air superiority
the ground reconnaissance must be prepared to extend its
29
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
reconnaissance Each arm supplements and assists the other
Team play is essential
(i) The successful operation of an armored unit will be
materially impeded if not stopped unless there is a constant
flow of information from the reconnaissance agencies to the
commander ' Communication from air to ground is usually
accomplished by radio or dropped messages ; from ground to
air by radio pick-up messages or by a prearranged system
of panel signals Information by radio from the aviation is
received by the ground reconnaissance agencies at the same
time it is received by the armored unit commander In this
way advantage is taken of important and vital information
and reconnaissance directed accordingly Ground elements
use motorcycles to augment or replace radio communication
(j) In order to give power and drive to the reconnaissance
battalion and sufficient combat power to overcome minor
opposition an armored (tank) company is provided This
company will normally remain with the battalion headquarters
in a central location if the road net permits It may
be dispatched in detachments or as a unit to furnish support
for reconnaissance companies when required Where
the front to be covered is so broad that prompt assistance
cannot be rendered ; or where critical points must be reached
and held temporarily ; or where hostile resistance is expected
to be encountered detachments of the armored (tank) company
may be attached initially to the reconnaissance company
elements When the necessity for the attachment no
longer exists the tank elements revert to battalion control
(k) Platoons and sections of the armored (tank) company
execute reconnaissance over terrain that is unsuitable for
wheeled vehicles They may also be used to reduce resistance
that is delaying the advance of the more lightly armored
units of the battalion
( ) Normally it will be desirable and necessary to attach
engineers to the battalion Elements from this detachment
accompany the reconnaissance units and furnish detailed
road information with particular reference to condition of
bridges and fords The engineer detachment locates and
makes initial preparations for stream crossings
(vi) The principal function of the battalion is reconnaissance
It should not be assigned security or combat missions
that will interfere with the performance of reconnaissance
30
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
29
(n) Provisions must be made for replenishment of rations
fuel and ammunition and for maintenance of vehicles
b Close reconnaissance -When contact with the enemy is
imminent reconnaissance is intensified More detailed information
will be required on points of decisive importance
near the probable or actual zone of contact of the ground
forces Air and ground reconnaissance agencies by continuous
reconnaissance endeavor to determine the contour and
identification of the enemy's leading elements the frontage
and depth of the enemy's movement his assembly position
his measures for antiaircraft defense the location of his
airdromes detraining stations principal supply establishments
and any changes when they occur
( ) Air -The primary mission of the air reconnaissance
is to extend In depth the zone under observation by ground
reconnaissance and to secure information which will enable
ground units to give effective direction to their reconnaissance
activities The principal objectives are roads communication
centers and exits of woods and villages These
objectives are closely observed both day and night with a
view to discovering the location of the enemy's main forces
and their direction of movement Flights made shortly after
dawn and before dark offer a favorable opportunity for discovery
of night movements The missions for the observation
aviation include: route reconnaissance march liaison
surveillance search tracking and photographic missions
(2) Ground -(a) Regimental reconnaissance is conducted
under the direction of the regimental commander by the
methods set forth in chapter 4 The reconnaissance elements
precedes the main body of the regiment by 3 to 4
hours and covers the entire width of the regimental zone
The regiment follows on one or more axial roads The extent
of the front or area covered by this reconnaissance
depends upon the mission amount and kind of resistance
expected the available road net and front covered by the
regiment A reconnaissance company under normal conditions
can reconnoiter a zone about 5 miles in width con
taming three or four axial roads and frequent lateral roads
at the rate of from 9 to 2 miles per hour
(b) Reconnaissance operations at night are generally restricted
to movements of elements to initial positions from
which they may continue or commence operations at dawn
3
29
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
Night reconnaissance limits observations and requires slower
speeds and more extensive dismounted observation Movement
by armored reconnaissance vehicles at night is limited
to roads except for short periods over favorable terrain or
during bright moonlight
(c) Detailed reconnaissance of important areas not covered
by elements from reconnaissance units may be executed
by patrols from the main body or at times by motorcycle
scouts The details of employment of scouts and patrols are
set forth in chapter 3
(d) Frequently reconnaissance elements will be required
to attack to obtain exact information of hostile dispositions
or they may encounter hostile mechanized counterreconnaissance
units When this is anticipated tank elements may
be attached to reinforce the reconnaissance platoons Normally
tank elements are not used for other than battle
reconnaissance
(e) Engineer and artillery reconnaissance personnel accompany
the regimental reconnaissance company
( ) The length of missions is dependent upon the ability
to supply gasoline and oil endurance of personnel and reservicing
and maintenance of vehicles
c Battle reconnaissance -Battle reconnaissance begins
when units initiate development for combat
( ) Air -(a) In the assignment of missions during battle
consideration must be given to the number of missions that
can be effectively executed with the aviation available Of
especial importance are the reconnaissance of movements
of hostile troops in rear areas and on the flanks of the battle
position and the surveillance of hostile detrucking and detraining
points Air reconnaissance and surveillance of areas
beyond the zone of reconnaissance of front line troops and
divisional ground reconnaissance will be continuous before
during and after battle
(b) Battle reconnaissance missions report all dispositions
and activities in the immediate battle area with particular
emphasis on the following :
Gaps in enemy positions enemy reserves command
posts railhead supply and distributing points and
tank and troop concentrations
2 Mechanized forces artillery and antitank guns
mines and demolitions road and area blocks

TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE

3 Conditions of routes bridges and terrain on the
projected route of the armored units and between
them and hostile armored forces
4 Artillery missions which include the location of
artillery targets adjustment of artillery fire report
of effect of fire and general surveillance of
scheduled artillery fires and enemy activity Airplanes
assigned to artillery missions operate under
direction of the artillery commander
(c) priority is given to radio in communicating information
to command posts ground reconnaissance elements
and to the artillery This method as compared to using
dropped messages expedites the action and quickens the battle
reconnaissance by obviating the necessity for the airplane
returning many miles with each important item of information
Moreover it permits the command post and interested
subordinate elements in the divisions to keep abreast
of the situation In case of radio failure or silence drop
messages may be resorted to This method may cause delay
in locating the various command posts
(d) A certain amount of battle liaison can be performed
simultaneously by airplanes on battle reconnaissance missions
However when enemy aerial and antiaircraft activity permits
battle liaison may be performed satisfactorily by the
slower liaison type of airplane Battle liaison is concerned
with:
Visual location of front lines and tactical disposition
of advanced elements
2 General locations and unusual conditions affecting
adjacent units
3 Command and liaison missions including the transmission
of information and instructions between
the superior commander and his artillery infantry
and other subordinate commanders ; also all observation
missions executed for special information
for the superior commander These missions
may be ordered for the purpose of obtaining or
verifying information as to the tactical situation
of the units engaged or to obtain other urgent
information

neighboring force or between units (elements) of a force on the march Elements of a connectinggroup used within a march column are called connectingfiles( ) Connecting groups are used to maintain contact withadjacent forces prior to and during combat(2) They are used between units within march columnswhere distance limits visual communication(3) They are always used during night marches within amarch column(4) Within the main body connecting groups are furnishedfrom the unit in rear to maintain contact with the precedingunit(5) Within a security detachment connecting groups arefurnished by the larger element to maintain contact withthe next smaller elementFor example from the main bodyto the advance guard (flank or rear guard) within theadvance guard from the support to the advance party(6) Connecting groups are especially useful when :(a) Observation is limited because of- terrain features orweather(b) A march column passes through a city or large town(c) The route of march has many changes of direction(d) The route of the preceding element is difficult to follow(7) Connecting groups are not to be confused with reconnaissance or combat patrols although their missions in certain situations are similar43	34-35TACTICS AND TECHNIQUEARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUALb Mission -The primary mission of a connecting group isliaisonSpecifically its duties are to( ) Keep the commander

supported by the advance partyOn winding roads or whereterrain features between definite bounds prevent visual contact elements within the point maintain visual contact untilthe next bound is reached thus avoiding stopping at intermediate points of no tactical value(2) Its principal duties in the advance are to(a) Reconnoiter the road on which the column Is marching and observe to the immediate flanks(b) Gain rapidly elevations edges of woods and otherpoints of vantage from which a good view to the front canbe obtained or which the enemy might try to occupy(c) Give timely warning to the element next in rear ofthe enemy's presence or of road blocks mines traps or similar methods for delaying a marching column(d) Drive back or disperse promptly small hostile patrolsWhen the enemy encountered is too strong to be defeated bythe point the point protects the next element in rear(e) Remove small obstacles blocking the route Whenthese obstacles require more manpower and technical equipment than that contained in the point it proceeds beyond theobstacle and protects the next element in rear while engagedin removing the obstacleWhen the obstacle Is defendedthe point first assists in driving off the enemy(f) Push boldly into villages along the line of march anddetermine promptly whether or not they are occupied by theenemy36(g) Remain on or near the route of advance in order toprotect the head of the column from surprise(3) In the execution of its duties the elements of the pointproceed as follows :(a) Motorcycle scouts if available work as a pair precedingthe rear

element(Seefig 2 )Its principle duties are to(a) Maintain connection with the point and assist it inovercoming resistance encountered on the line of march(b) Extend flank reconnaissance to a distance of about800 yards(c) Check the enemy's advance until the element next inrear has time to prepare for actionIn case the enemy encountered is too strong for the advance party to defeat thelatter reports the fact to the next element in rear and reconnoiters the enemy's strength and dispositions(2) In the execution of its duties the elements of the advance party proceed as follows :(a) Each vehicle commander receives acknowledges andpasses signals both from the front and rear and moves bybounds coordinating its advance with the rear vehicle of thepoint(b) When contact is gained the leading

_ Self concealment of tanks by smoke, also the' firing. of
smoke shells by tanks and artillery detailed for covering fire
are effective aide in protection from enemy reconnaissance and
115.
116 .
A first task will be to find, out new openings for
action, to assure covering fire for the pioneers and to hold' ;
the formation ready so that it can form up quickly after lanes
have been created or the minefield has been removed.
Leaders of all ranks must themselves try_ at once to
-di$coyeri:aps .in the minefield or to. use their attached pioneers
to make lanes under the covering fire of tanks .-
fire when encountering mines . .
Detailed instructions for units' encountering mines
are' contained in hapter 5 of Divisional Order 470/6 .
The great number of vehicles in a. tank regiment
usually necessitates the forming of several billeting groups ;
advantage will be taken of habitations in areas affording cover'.
Billets must be camouflaged against ground and air
bbservation and must allow free movement in several direction

When deployment begins, it will .follow'`in' close
formation under a single leader in such a way that it car_ be
quickly brought up by a battalion before going into action in
order to relieve crews and for maintenance . purposes .
124 . -All remaining-vehicles of th3 battle transport will go
to B Echelon battle transport. It will be brought on_ in close
formation by the, regiment . Its movement is often controlled -by
the division .

and energetic officers .
126 .
During action, the maintenance groups form part of the
'fighting units . Their role 'is decided by the battalion
commander .
The commander of the maintenance 'groups, the battalion
.engineer, decides which vehicles will be sent to the Tank
Workshop ompany for repair . He is in intercommunication with
the : Battalion ommander and the regimental, engineer.
To the supply transport belong the ration vehicles of
Headquarters aryl of the ompanies ; they are commanded by the
Battalion .Messing Officer .

129 . The Me4ioal Service is controlled by the battalion
medical officer .
Quick medical assistance, particularly in battle,
must be provided by a doctor accompanying the attack in an
armoured ambulance .
The setting up of the regimental aid post and the
evacuation of wounded to the main dressing station. are the task
of the second medical officer .

The Regimental ommander must give particular
attention to maintaining his tanks ready for action . He has
a Workshop ompany for the repair of tanks .
131 .
The mad n task of .the Tank Workshop ompany is the
repair of tanks . In order to work effectively, the tank
workshop company must to a certain extent be stationary .
Movement by bounds is,' therefore, necessary to keep it working
in one place for several days . Its timely an appropriate
employment is decisive in the maintenance of the fighting
strength of the regiment .

Before going into action, the complete supply of the
tank battalion must' .be arranged. Battle :transport must be
divided accordingly (see paragraph 122) . n a march during
which no action is anticipated, P.O.L., lorries and some of the
field kitchens will be placed among the ""companies. This will
reduce the time necessary for them to come into .action at the

connected by a line on thie map ; this line must lie in the direction
of the attack . The line will be divided in centimetres, . with the

means are available they should be utilized keeping the
net free and available for emergency messages Such additional
means are ; from air to ground: dropped messages
rocket signals and simple airplane maneuvers ; from ground
to air : pick-up messages or by prearranged system of panel
or other signals
(2) Ground -(a) Immediately preceding combat as the
enemy main force is approached detailed reconnaissance of
hostile dispositions and of terrain is intensified by all reconnaissance
agencies
As the regimental reconnaissance companies and security
detachments of the various columns make
contact with the enemy the reconnaissance battalion
may be relieved by them and move to the
flanks and continue reconnaissance against the
hostile flanks and rear
2 Elements of the reconnaissance battalion in contact
with the enemy maintain contact during combat
In this case regimental reconnaissance companies
may be attached to the reconnaissance battalion
to continue reconnaissance to the flanks and rear
(b) During combat the division reconnaissance elements
gain contact with the enemy by working through gaps
and around the flanks and rear and ascertain the strength
composition and dispositions of the enemy main force and
the approach of enemy reinforcements When ordered the
reconnaissance elements avail themselves of every opportunity
to harass enemy command and supply installations reserves
or reinforcements without becoming engaged in combat at
the expense of adequate reconnaissance
Where the terrain or the situation prohibits further
reconnaissance to the front during battle the
divisional reconnaissance battalion may be ordered
to protect an exposed flank or the rear of the
division and give timely warning of approaching
air and tank attacks It may be withdrawn into
division reserve to reservice and recuperate pending
further missions
2 Regimental reconnaissance units when no longer
able to perform reconnaissance to the front proceed
to the flanks of their unit to secure them

during combat and give warning of air and tank
attacks
(c) After combat the reconnaissance battalion moves either
around the flanks or through a gap in the hostile front to
determine the routes of withdrawal of the hostile main
column ; whether his withdrawal is well organized or in disorder
; the covering positions with reference to his columns ;
and whether or not critical points on his routes are held in
strength Contact must be maintained
(d) When the battle results in the withdrawal of our own
forces contact with the enemy must be maintained The
delaying force must be constantly informed of the progress
of the hostile troops
Divisional reconnaissance towards the enemy will be
extended to the flanks to obtain information of
the direction of the main threat of the enemy's
pursuit or exploitation
2 The reconnaissance battalion may be ordered to delay
and harass the enemy by action against his
head and flanks while continuing reconnaissance
3 Reconnaissance In the direction of withdrawal must
be instituted to insure that the routes of withdrawal
are free of enemy and clear of obstacles
(e) After combat the regimental reconnaissance companies
prepare to assist in the exploitation pursuit or withdrawal
of their regiment in the same manner as the divisional
reconnaissance units function with the division A portion of
the regimental reconnaissance may be attached to rear or
flank guards when necessary to further the mission of these
security detachments (See sec III )
d Tank reconnaissance -This type of reconnaissance is
conducted prior to an operation when the use of tanks is
contemplated It is made to determine : the location capacity
concealment and suitability of positions ; the routes
to selected positions ; the terrain over which tanks may operate
; and the allotment of tanks
( ) The Items to be considered regarding positions include
in general :
(a) Routes Into and within the assembly or intermediate
position
'
(b) Available routes to point of probable subsequent
activities
3 5
29
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(c) Available routes to alternate positions
(d) Water (quantity quality and reliability)
(e) Cover and concealment
(I) Capacity and suitability
(g) Standings for vehicles under all weather conditions
(h) Protection from hostile fire
(i) Suitability for local defense
(g) Shelter for maintenance activities
(k) Assignment of areas to subordinate units
( ) Tactical soundness of location
(2) Prior to any movement of tank units principle routes
and alternate routes should be thoroughly reconnoitered and
a suitable system established for marking the routes and furnishing
guides In reconnoitering routes consideration must
be given to the following :
(a) Means of identification day or night ; i eâ by landmarks
sketches description map reference or aerial photographs
(b) Critical points and areas for location of guides and route
markers
(c) Distance over entire route and important parts thereof
and time required to traverse them
(d) Detailed data on routes such as kind (road trail or
cross country) ; width (one-way or two-way) ; grades ; surface
(firmness smoothness) ; defiles ; availability ; probable
effect of changes in the weather; and practical speeds day or
night wet or dry
(e) Cover and concealment including defilade
( ) Fords ; whether depth and conditions of bottom and
approaches permit crossing and whether water level is rising
or falling
(g) Bridges including location size kind capacity condition
and material required for reinforcement Also possibility
of detouring around them
(h) Tank obstacles including mines and contaminated
areas ; their location nature and possibility of removing
neutralizing or avoiding them
(i) Friendly installations including steps necessary to prevent
destruction of telephone wire point of crossing field
works or work and material necessary to insure expeditious
crossing
(j) Routes for passage through friendly lines

(k) Routes for wheeled transportation forward to the line
of departure
( ) Comparative desirability of all routes
e Personal reconnaissance In preparing for combat personal
reconnaissance of the terrain by the commander staff
officers and subordinate commanders under protection of
leading elements is conducted whenever possible to supplement
and verify reports of reconnaissance agencies
q 30 TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION-a All commanders are
responsible that their immediate and lower unit commanders
are promptly and fully informed of the situation
b Neighboring units and reconnaissance agencies when
meeting habitually exchange pertinent information Reconnaissance
elements in contact with the enemy cooperate with
reconnaissance elements and security detachments that may
be employed in the interval between the main force and the
reconnaissance elements in contact Information of vital interest
to these reconnaissance elements and security detachments
is transmitted through ""listening in"" radio sets dropped
messages from airplanes or by messengers
c First contact with the enemy and new identifications are
always reported by the most rapid means available Negative
reports must be submitted with the same promptness as positive
information
d Prisoners inhabitants messages from patrols and documents
are examined by the reconnaissance unit or detachment
commander and forwarded to the main body by the quickest
and most reliable means available Radio airplanes scout
cars motorcycles or impressed motor transportation may be
used In friendly or occupied territory commercial wires
should be used whenever practicable
e Captured prisoners are evacuated by any available means
together with a digest of their individual statements
/ Units in contact although closely engaged in combat are
not relieved of the responsibility of making reports as often
as desired by the higher commander In order to offset the
failure to receive a report commanders must make provision
for obtaining prompt information by special reconnaissance
and by sending liaison agents to higher subordinate or
adjacent units
37
3 0 -32
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
g Artillery observers and liaison officers transmit to the
higher commander over their own communication systems
important information which might otherwise be delayed
in transmission
â 3 SUMMARY -a The prompt employment of armored
force units necessitates early information of the enemy and
of the terrain in order for the commander to formulate sound
plans and make prompt decisions
b All available reconnaissance agencies must be used boldly
to gain and maintain contact and obtain information
c Reconnaissance agencies must be dispatched in advance
of the main force in time to allow for proper reconnaissance
of the designated zones routes or localities and to get information
back to the commander in time to be of value
d Information must be transmitted by the quickest and
most reliable means available
e Prior to combat personal reconnaissance by the commander
staff officers and subordinate commanders must
supplement and verify reports of reconnaissance agencies
f All reconnaissance personnel must be trained to note
and report on suitable terrain for the employment of tanks ;
possible emergency landing fields ; water and gasoline supply
sources ; and similar Items of vital importance to armored
force units
g The successful operation of an armored force is dependent
upon a constant flow of information to the commander
SECTION III
SECURITY
â 32 GENERAL -a Security -Security embraces all measures
taken by a command to protect itself against annoyance
surprise attack observation and interference by the enemy
It includes the special measures taken for protection against
hostile aviation and ground forces including mechanized and
chemical attacks Security is always necessary whether in
movement at the halt or in combat In bivouac and in
movement security is provided in all directions Adequate
and timely information is the basis of all security measures
Continuous reconnaissance is therefore an essential part of
security Security retains freedom of maneuver for the
commander
38
TcTfos AND TECnNIQI g
32-35
b Responsibility -The commander of each unit is responsible
for the security of his command This includes the protection
of his lines of communication unless such protection
is furnished by the higher commander The superior commander
prescribes security measures for the protection of the
command as a whole or coordinates those adopted by subordinate
commanders He insures that measures adopted are
appropriate to the hostile threat Subordinate commanders
provide additional security required for their own local protection
When contact is imminent security measures are
increased
c Warning -All security measures include an adequate
warning service consisting of observers and the means of
signal communication In this manner changes in hostile
dispositions and other operations on the ground and in the
air are known early Special measures are taken to warn
of the approach of hostile mechanized or air forces
â 33 SECURITY AGAINST GROUND FORCES -The principal security
measures against ground forces include reconnaissance
the employment of security detachments the distribution
formation and mobility of units and utilization of terrain
a Reconnaissance -While reconnaissance is closely allied
with security reconnaissance and security forces operate in
accordance with different considerations Reconnaissance
influences security by indicating to the commander the measures
to be taken to protect his forces Under certain conditions
It may be the only measure employed for security
Information furnished through reconnaissance is a guide to
the commander for determining the strength composition
and disposition of his security detachments
b Security detachments -( ) General--Security detachments
are elements of a command assigned to protect the
main body Such detachments are always necessary whether
in movement at the halt or in combat On the march security
detachments are called advance guards rear guards flank
guards and march outposts ; in camp in bivouac or in a
defensive position they are called outposts ; during development
for combat covering detachments ; and in combat
combat patrols (See FM 00-5 )
(2) Missions -In general the mission of a security detachment
is to furnish the command with information rela
39
3 3
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
tive to the enemy to protect the command against surprise
observation and interference by hostile ground forces and
to maintain the freedom of maneuver for the command by
gaining the time and space it requires to make the necessary
dispositions The priority given to these missions embodying
reconnaissance counterreconnaissance and resistance varies
with the situation and the expressed intentions of the
commander
(a) Information of the enemy in proximity is obtained
by the reconnaissance elements or combat patrols from the
security detachment
(b) Protection of the main body from surprise observation
and interference is accomplished by preventing the
enemy firing into the main body and from observing the
size dispositions and composition of the main body ; and by
holding the enemy and gaining time for the main body to
deploy before coming under effective fire
(c) Freedom of maneuver of the main body is insured by
the security detachment which according to circumstances
attacks resists or delays the hostile forces
(3) Strength -The strength of a security detachment depends
upon the mission assigned it the terrain proximity
of the enemy and the size composition and physical condition
of the command In certain situations security detachments
constitute a partial commitment of the strength of a
command to action They are given sufficient strength to
preserve freedom of action for the main body and no more
As far as practicable tactical unity is preserved in the detail
of security detachments
(4) Formations of security detachments -There is a similarity
in the formation of advance flank and rear guards
and outposts Each comprise groups which send out patrols
or post sentinels for observation These reconnaissance
groups are reinforced by a support the principal element of
resistance In large security detachments a reserve is provided
The reserve constitutes the principal maneuvering
and reinforcing element for offensive or defensive action as
determined by the mission of the security detachment
These missions in turn depend upon the plan for the subsequent
employment of the command as a whole
(5) Distances or time interval -(a) The distances or
time interval between the main body and the security de-
40
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE 33
tachments and between subdivisions of the security detachments
will vary with the size and mission of the security
detachment visibility and terrain and strength composition
and proximity of the enemy It should be sufficient to allow
the security detachments time to cope with small hostile
forces to allow successive elements of the detachment space
to maneuver and to secure the uninterrupted movement of
the main body
(b) The normal distances between vehicles and units comprising
elements of security detachments on the march will
be those prescribed for tactical marches (See sec VII )
Fixed or routine distances cannot be prescribed for all movements
of detachments as terrain composition mission hostile
air activity and many other factors will influence the
conduct of the movement
(c) When operating in darkness fog or in close country
distances maintained will be less than when operating in
daylight clear weather or in open country Distances between
the main body and security detachments and between
subdivisions of the security detachments should be reduced
to that consistent with control ; between vehicles it should
be reduced to that consistent with visual communication with
the vehicle immediately preceding and following
(6) Rate of march -The march order prescribes the rate
of march for the command and the distance between the
security detachments and the main body The main body
regulates the rate of march whenever the command must
maintain a certain rate of march to reach a designated place
at a prescribed time When contact is imminent the advance
guard regulates the march
(7) Communication -( a) Communication between the
elements of the security detachment and between the security
detachments and the main body is maintained by the
quickest means available Radio except when radio silence
is necessary or motorcycle messengers are the principal
means employed The commander and leader of each element
of the security detachment have radio equipped vehicles
In addition one or more motorcyclist should accompany
the security detachment commander for messenger
service
(b) Leaders of security detachments send information
4
3 3 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
promptly Promptness is vital because of the mobility of
all units
(8) Control -(a) Control is obtained by means of radio
visual signals connecting files or the main body commander
may designate phase lines control points assembly positions
or message relay points when such are necessary to insure
control and facilitate communications
(b) The normal drill signals for ""halt "" ""forward "" and
""assembly "" and simple improvised signals to indicate ""enemy
in sight"" or ""all clear"" are used
(e) Contact between elements of security detachments and
between the main body and security detachments is maintained
by connecting groups or files (See par 34 )
(9) Movement -Security detachments on the march regulate
their movements so as to give the main body the protection
required by the tactical situation and offered by the
terrain When contact is imminent they move by bounds as
outlined in the following subparagraphs When darkness
fog or rapid rate of march of the main body makes the
movement by bounds Impracticable or inadvisable movement
is continuous and at a prescribed rate
(a) An advance by bounds is accomplished by a forward
element gaining distance over the one in rear to reach some
important point which possesses tactical advantage either
for observation or combat The smaller the element the
more easily its speed can be changed and the shorter and
more frequent are its bounds
(b) A bound of a forward element should not be so great
as to place' it beyond supporting distance of the next succeeding
element
(c) A bound of a rear element should be under the protection
of the element next in front
(d) An advance by bounds has several important advantages
It-
Enables an element to reconnoiter the terrain before the
following element has closed up
Permits the crossing of terrain that may be under hostile
observation or fire in the shortest time
Offers opportunities for the interrogation of Inhabitants
and for servicing of vehicles
Offers opportunities to coordinate the advance

main body is made in accordance with their probable tactical
employment Each unit makes provision for prompt
formation and movement to facilitate the command's readiness
for action
d Utilization of terrain Terrain and the road net influence
the commander in his selection of positions or routes
for the main body and for the security detachments A map
study supplemented by air and ground reconnaissance will
disclose terrain which may afford protection to the command
while in movement or at the halt A consideration of the
road net and terrain will also be a determining factor in the
location of the security detachments with respect to the
main body
U 34 CONNECTING GROUPS (FILES) --a A connecting group
is a detachment detailed by a force to maintain contact
(liaison) with a neighboring force or between units (elements)
of a force on the march Elements of a connecting
group used within a march column are called connecting
files
( ) Connecting groups are used to maintain contact with
adjacent forces prior to and during combat
(2) They are used between units within march columns
where distance limits visual communication
(3) They are always used during night marches within a
march column
(4) Within the main body connecting groups are furnished
from the unit in rear to maintain contact with the preceding
unit
(5) Within a security detachment connecting groups are
furnished by the larger element to maintain contact with
the next smaller element For example from the main body
to the advance guard (flank or rear guard) within the
advance guard from the support to the advance party
(6) Connecting groups are especially useful when :
(a) Observation is limited because of- terrain features or
weather
(b) A march column passes through a city or large town
(c) The route of march has many changes of direction
(d) The route of the preceding element is difficult to follow
(7) Connecting groups are not to be confused with reconnaissance
or combat patrols although their missions in certain
situations are similar
43
34-35
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
b Mission -The primary mission of a connecting group is
liaison Specifically its duties are to-
( ) Keep the commander of the force from which detailed
informed of the location and progress of neighboring units
(2) Observe and report any penetrating hostile force and
oppose such force until arrival of reinforcements or until
the threat has ceased
(3) Maintain connections and liaison within a march
column
c Strength and composition -( ) The strength of a connecting
group depends upon its mission When its mission
is one of liaison it may be small ; when the distance between
adjacent forces is great and hostile threat exists it is larger
It varies from two motorcyclists to a platoon
(2) For liaison with adjacent units scout car half-track
/4 -ton truck or tank elements may be used
(3) For liaison on the march between armored units such
groups consist of two or more motorcyclists or /4-ton trucks
The number of motorcyclists detailed for this purpose will
depend upon the distance between units the terrain visibility
and the number of motorcyclists available
d Formations and methods of operation -( ) Formations
for connecting groups vary with their mission terrain and
hostile situation
(2) For contact and liaison with an adjacent force a patrol
formation is used
(3) For contact and liaison within a march column a
connecting group usually marches in the interval between
the units to which its mission applies
(a) Whenever visual contact is broken connecting files
preferably in pairs are detached from the group to maintain
visual contact When visual contact is regained they close
on the connecting group leader at increased speed if in rear
of the leader ; or halt and await his arrival if in front of the
leader
(b) When the number of connecting files is limited and
visual contact cannot be maintained because of distance or
terrain connecting files move by bounds
0 35 COMBAT PATROLS -a Purpose -( ) Combat patrols are
security detachments sent out to the front flanks and rear
to protect the main body or the detachment from which sent

(2) Units engaged in combat employ combat patrols for
their protection
b Mission -The primary mission of combat patrols is
security Specifically their duties are to-
( ) Observe the terrain for hostile dispositions and movement
(2) Gain contact with the enemy in a close situation and
furnish timely information of enemy movements towards or
around the flanks
(3) Drive off small enemy forces which threaten the front
flanks and rear and contain larger forces until suitable
preparations can be made to oppose them
c Strength and composition -The strength of a combat
patrol depends upon the force from which detailed the enemy
and the terrain It may consist of a pair of motorcyclists
one or more I/4-ton trucks a section of half-tracks or a section
or platoon of tanks
d Formation and methods of operation -Combat patrols
operate under orders from the commander of the force from
which they are detailed The formation in which they move is
similar to that prescribed for reconnaissance patrols Their
conduct is different in that combat is usually required for the
accomplishment of their missions They regulate their movements

security detachment which precedes the main body on the
march
b Mission and duties -The mission of an advance guard
is to insure the uninterrupted advance of the main body and
to protect it against surprise and observation by hostile ground
forces Specifically its duties are to-
( ) Guard against surprise and to obtain information by
reconnoitering to the front and flanks
(2) Push back small parties of the enemy and to prevent
their observing firing upon or delaying the main body
(3) Check the enemy's advance in force long enough to
permit the main body to prepare for action
(4) Determine the strength and location of the hostile lines
and flanks when the enemy is encountered on the defensive
but to avoid bringing on a general engagement unless empowered
to do so

obtains or upon the actions of the latter the advance guard
regulates the rate of march At night it is usual for the
advance guard to regulate the rate of march
f Main body commander ( ) The main body commander
issues the order for the movement of his troops and
prescribes the size and composition of the advance guard
or guards to be employed
(2) He issues the necessary instructions to insure the
operation of the advance guard in furtherance of his general
plans and to control its progress and movement

(2) During the advance he may control the advance guard
from any position His usual position is in rear of the
advance party
(3) When the enemy is encountered he makes a rapid personal
reconnaissance and decision for the employment of
the advance guard as follows :
(a) To employ any part of the advance guard as necessary
to dislodge the enemy in time to prevent delay of the march
of the main body
(b) To establish a defensive position to cover the approach
march and offensive action of the main body
(c) To contain or delay a hostile force permitting the
main body to continue its advance
(4) When the leading elements of the advance guard engage
the enemy the advance guard commander moves forward
close to the axis of movement of the advance guard
to observe the action and to keep the commander of the main
body informed of the situation When the enemy has been
disposed of he reorganizes the advance guard elements rapidly

-Reconnaissance elements may be attached to a covering detachment the size of a company orordered to cooperate with a smaller covering detachmentWhen the terrain and road net are favorable early information of hostile dispositions can be obtained by the reconnaissance elements which enables a covering detachment tobetter carry out its missionE 38 REAR GUARDS -a General -A rear guard is a securitydetachment which follows and covers the main body on themarch The fundamentals covering rear guards and rearguard action are contained in FM 00-5b Who may perform -Armored units are suitable to perform rear guard duty because of their mobility and fire powerwhich enable them to withdraw quickly after delaying thepursuing enemy to the last possible moment However this56TACTICSAND TECHNIQUE38use is exceptional and sacrifices their offensive power Thismission should not be assigned armored units when other suitable units are available However the rear guard coveringthe retirement of a combined force often contains armoredunitsc Mission and duties -The mission of a rear guard is toassure an uninterrupted movement of the main body and toprotect it from attack observation or interference by hostileground forces Specifically its duties are to( ) Guard against surprise and furnish information byobserving to the rear(2) Hold back small forces of the enemy and prevent theirobserving firing upon or delaying the main body(3) Check an enemy in force until the main body has timetc prepare for action march beyond the range of hostile fireor occupy a position(4) Provide suitable passive measures of opposition such asinterposing obstacles and destroying or damaging bridges androads(5) Collect stragglers and lost vehicles and destroyabandoned propertyd Strength and composition -The strength and composition of a rear guard for armored units depends upon themission,' direction of a march nature of the terrain andupon the mobility and strength of hostile forces likely to beencountered Its strength and composition should be suchas to permit the execution of its mission without the intervention of the main body( ) Strength -Its strength varies from a small fraction toabout one fourth of the command(2) Composition -It normally is composed of machine gunand tank elements It may be augmented by artillery andmortar elements to provide greater combat power for reconnaissance units , and by engineers chemical and medicaltroops At night it may be composed of infantry and engineerelements and when the situation is obscure it should consistprimarily of armored or motorized infantrye Formation -The rear guard formation resembles that ofan advance guard reversed Next behind the main bodymarches the reserve followed in turn by the support rearparty and rear point In general the size of the rear guardis smaller than an advance guard except in retrograde move57,,38ARMOREDFORCE FIELD MANUALTACTICS AND TECHNIQUEmentsWhen the size makes it impracticable to have allthe elements they are omitted in order of size beginning withthe reserve A rear point is always presentf Distances or time interval -On the march distances ortime intervals between the rear guard and the main body andbetween subdivisions of the rear guard vary In general theyare governed by the size and mission of the rear guard byvisibility and terrain , and by the strength composition mobility and proximity of the enemyThe distances and timeintervals previously outlined for advance guards may be takenas a guide subject to the following :( ) Support to reserve -The minimum distance betweenthe support and reserve is determined by the considerationthat the support must delay the enemy until the reserve canprepare for action The maximum distance is that which thereserve can take without exposing the support to the liability of being cut offThese distances may be greater inopen country or during daylight than under the oppositeconditions(2) Reserve to main body -The minimum distance betweenthe reserve and the main body is determined by the consideration that the rear guard must protect and not be driven backupon the main bodyThe maximum distance is that whichcan separate the reserve and the main body without subjecting the rear guard to the danger of being cut off by the enemyIt must not be such as will permit intervention of hostileforces in strength between the reserve and the main bodyg Rate of march -( ) The march order prescribes the rateof march for the command and the time or distance betweenthe rear guard and the main body(2) The elements of the rear guard usually retire by boundsbased on the progress of the main body and the time limitset by the main body commander for holding designated linesThey may follow the main body at a steady rate of marchwhen conditions render the movement by bounds impracticalor unnecessaryh Communication and control -Communication and control are maintained between the rear guard and the mainbody and between subdivisions of the rear guard in the samegeneral manner as has been previously outlined for advanceguardsn38i Conduct of rear guard -( ) When the distance from theenemy permits the rear guard retires in march formation(2) When in contact with the enemy the rear guard moveson a broad front and opens fire at long range to force theenemy to deploy and thus delay his advanceUnless thesecurity of the main body requires a stubborn resistance therear guard as far as practicable avoids close range combatand withdraws successively from position to position as theenemy approaches(3) The rear guard fights in successive positions(4) The rear guard commander makes timely provisionfor preliminary reconnaissance of new positions and routesthereto(5) The successive positions of the rear guard are chosenat such distance from each other that the enemy is forcedto renew his preparations for attack including forward displacement of his artillery in each instance(6) A rear guard position should favor withdrawal by affording covered routes of withdrawal(7) When the enemy presses his pursuit closely greaterresistance is offered Full use is made of surprise attacksand ambushes to slow down or halt the hostile advance(8) In general the main efforts of the rear guard like thoseof any delaying force must be constantly directed towardbarring roads or other avenues of approach and denying ordisputing to the limit of available means their use by theenemy forces(9) Hostile mechanized elements usually attempt to attackfrom the flank Against such forces care must be taken toprevent dispersion of the rear guard in order that it may beable to repel flank attacks and avoid being cut off from themain body( 0) Advantage is taken of favorable opportunities topunish over-hasty pursuit by counterattacks against the headsof pursuing columns or against hostile forces attacking fromthe flankAmbush of leading hostile elements will be effective in slowing down and punishing a hasty enemySuchtactics will cause the enemy to be more cautious and consequently slower in action( ) A rear guard resorts to such defensive measures forhalting or delaying the enemy as obstructing fords

elementof the rear guard constitutes its chief maneuvering forceIt is a duty of the reserve in particular to detect the presence of any hostile forces attempting an encircling maneuverIt delays the enemy by means of all available fire power andwhen occasion demands by offensive action in cooperationwith the support In case the situation requires the rearguard to effect a long delay of the enemy force the reserveunder protection of the support occupies strong delayingpositions It maneuvers as necessary to either side of theroutek Artillery -Field artillery may be attached to the rearguard for a regiment or larger unitWhen attached it generally marches near the head of the largest element of therear guard Because of its great range artillery can forcethe enemy off roads before he is within range of small armsfire and can compel him to march across country in deployedformation or to use circuitous routes in order to obtaincoverAviation-While not normally attached to the rearguard

suitable troops are available for such dutyadjacent units(3) When the protection usually afforded by 3962TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE39or obstacles is absent a flank guard may be necessaryb Mission -The mission of a flank guard is to insure theuninterrupted advance or retirement of a force and to protect it from attack observation or harassment by hostileground forces from the flank Its duties are similar to thoseof advance and rear guardsc Strength and composition -The strength and composition of a flank guard varies according to the situation froma patrol to a force of all arms When the main body executes a flank march in proximity of the enemy flank protection assumes great importance , a strong flank guard isdetailedd Distance-U) Since the mission of a flank guard is toprotect the flank of a marching column it is interposed between this column and the located or anticipated hostilethreats The distance of operation to the flank will varydepending upon the enemy composition terrain such asdefiles and obstacles and particularly upon adjacent roadsparallel to the route of the main force(2) Large flank guards should be far enough out to theflank to prevent hostile artillery or antitank weapons fromplacing effective fire on the main body Small flank guardpatrol should be far enough out to protect the commandfrom enemy machine gun and antitank gun fire(3) Distance between elements of the flank guard on themarch may conform to those between elements of an advanceor rear guard When continuous flank protection is required the flank guard is distributed in detachments to giveprotection throughout the length of the main body Criticalareas (key positions) controlling avenues of approach maybe occupied and held until the main body has passed (Seeg below )e Rate of march -( ) The rate of march of the flankguard conforms generally to that of the main body(2) When movement of the flank guard is by bounds therate of march will be based on the progress of the main bodyor the time limit set by the main body commander for holding specific localities or pointsf Communication and control -( ) The communicationfacilities afforded by the use of radio aviation motor andmotorcycle messengers enable the flank guard commander tomaintain contact with the main body63,39ARMORED FORCE FIELDMANUAL(2) Where the terrain permits contact with the main bodymay be maintained through connecting groups(3) Contact is frequently gained with flank guards andtheir movement controlled by the main body commander ondesignated phase lines or objectives(4) Communication and control are maintained betweensubdivisions of the flank guard in the same manner as haspreviously been outlined for advance guardsg Conduct of flank guard -( ) Flank guards are conductedwith especial reference to routes or localities which favorattack against the flanks of a command(2) When a route generally parallel to the line of marchflankof the main body exists and more or less continuousprotection is required throughout the depth of the columnduring the march the flank guard marches parallel to themain body to cover possible routes of hostile attack Except as indicated below it is distributed in echelons oversufficient depth to offer resistance to attack at various pointson the flank of the main body and to prevent inroads ofsmall hostile detachments(3) When the locality from which an attack is to be expected is well defined a flank guard occupies a key positioncovering the routes of approach to the main body until thecommand has passed(4) When several such

"ontinues the advance
h Point commander -( ) The point commander is responsible
for the conduct of the point In large advance
guards the point commander may be mounted on a /4-ton
truck and ride wherever he deems his presence necessary
His usual position is with the self-propelled mount
(2) He instructs the point en route and makes sure that
the designated route is followed
(3) In case the designated route becomes impracticable
or obstacles are encountered over which the main body
cannot readily move he notifies the next higher commander
and executes reconnaissance promptly to determine routes
around the obstacle
(4) In case the enemy is encountered he will :
(a) Report contact
(b) Employ the self-propelled mount to drive off hostile
resistance Send dismounted members of the point to re-
49
36
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
connoiter the enemy position fire on and mark the hostile
flanks with tracer ammunition and to signal If the enemy
withdraws
(c) Send prompt information to the next higher commander
of the hostile strength composition and disposition
(d) Reorganize the point following combat prepared to
continue the advance
(5) If the scouts sent out from the point remain out of
view for an unreasonable period the point commander will
assume that these scouts have been shot or captured and
will send dismounted scouts to reconnoiter the place where
they disappeared before permitting the point to proceed
iâ¢ Point -( ) The point is both a reconnaissance and security
element (See fig 2 ) Its observation is limited to
the line of march It pushes forward boldly by bounds employing
the self-propelled mount if attached closely supported
by the advance party On winding roads or where
terrain features between definite bounds prevent visual contact
elements within the point maintain visual contact until
the next bound is reached thus avoiding stopping at intermediate
points of no tactical value
(2) Its principal duties in the advance are to-
(a) Reconnoiter the road on which the column Is marching
and observe to the immediate flanks
(b) Gain rapidly elevations edges of woods and other
points of vantage from which a good view to the front can
be obtained or which the enemy might try to occupy
(c) Give timely warning to the element next in rear of
the enemy's presence or of road blocks mines traps or similar
methods for delaying a marching column
(d) Drive back or disperse promptly small hostile patrols
When the enemy encountered is too strong to be defeated by
the point the point protects the next element in rear
(e) Remove small obstacles blocking the route When
these obstacles require more manpower and technical equipment
than that contained in the point it proceeds beyond the
obstacle and protects the next element in rear while engaged
in removing the obstacle When the obstacle Is defended
the point first assists in driving off the enemy
(f) Push boldly into villages along the line of march and
determine promptly whether or not they are occupied by the
enemy
50
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
36
(g) Remain on or near the route of advance in order to
protect the head of the column from surprise
(3) In the execution of its duties the elements of the point
proceed as follows :
(a) Motorcycle scouts if available work as a pair preceding
the rear vehicle ( /4-ton truck self-propelled mount armored
car half-track or tank) keeping always a bound ahead They
move in single column staggered on either side of the road at
a distance of 35 to 50 yards between scouts Successive bounds
are made at the maximum speed road conditions permit
(b) At the end of each succeeding bound they slow down
halt short of the crest bend etcâ and the leading scout (:Ismounted
moves to reconnoiter the terrain to the front and
check the route The remaining scout observes to the flanks
He also is employed to reconnoiter lateral roads if necessary
riding out to a position where he can observe for at least 600
yards (effective rifle range) Motorcyclists maintain contact
within the point
(c) When an obstacle or enemy is discovered one scout
reports this information to the point commander the other
scout remaining in observation
(d) Scouts do not move forward to the next bound until
they have signalled ""all clear"" to the remainder of the point
Control is maintained by visual signals
(e) When fired upon scouts seek cover report contact and
then reconnoiter to determine the direction and nature of
the hostile action They fire their weapons in self-defense
and to warn elements in rear
(/) In case a hostile position has been passed without being
observed by the scouts they will return dismount and attack
the enemy They will especially seek and bring under fire
antitank guns or machine guns If the enemy withdraws
they endeavor to ambush him The scouts avoid getting in
the line of fire from other elements of the advance guard
(g) Upon reaching a terrain feature In rear of the motorcyclists
crew members from the rear vehicle of the point
observe to the immediate flanks When the terrain time element
and situation warrant a dismounted reconnaissance
will be made for a short distance to either side of the route
of march
(h) This vehicle closes on the motorcyclists on receipt of
5
36
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
signals from the motorcyclists It coordinates by bounds
its movement with that of the advance party
(i) If the enemy is encountered the rear vehicle and the
self-propelled mount if present will move forward depending
upon the location of the enemy and place fire on the enemy
The crew when necessary will continue its reconnaissance
dismounted
j Advance party -( ) The advance party is both a reconnaissance
(maneuvering) and holding (pivot) element (See
fig 2 ) Its principle duties are to-
(a) Maintain connection with the point and assist it in
overcoming resistance encountered on the line of march
(b) Extend flank reconnaissance to a distance of about
800 yards
(c) Check the enemy's advance until the element next in
rear has time to prepare for action In case the enemy encountered
is too strong for the advance party to defeat the
latter reports the fact to the next element in rear and reconnoiters
the enemy's strength and dispositions
(2) In the execution of its duties the elements of the advance
party proceed as follows :
(a) Each vehicle commander receives acknowledges and
passes signals both from the front and rear and moves by
bounds coordinating its advance with the rear vehicle of the
point
(b) When contact is gained the leading vehicle remains
on or near the axis of march and engages the enemy by fire
to support the action of the remainder of the advance party
(c) If subjected to surprise fire the leading vehicle will
seek a defiladed firing position if immediately available ; otherwise
unless a tank the vehicle will be abandoned for a
dismounted position
(d) Whenever fire is opened on the leading vehicle the
advance party commander in the next vehicle in column
makes a hasty reconnaissance mounted or dismounted depending
upon the available cover and disposes the advance
party initially to protect the next element in rear
(e) In larger advance guards a platoon of tanks an
engineer section and one or more mortar squads constitutes
the advance party They perform reconnaissance to the
flanks either by having a patrol march parallel to the axis
of movement where the terrain permits or by having the
5 2
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
36
patrol move direct to reconnoiter features of terrain and return
to the axis Only those terrain features that may afford
possible positions for the enemy should be reconnoitered
This reconnaissance is continuous when dictated by the
situation and terrain
(f) When enemy resistance stops the advance the tank
platoon extends reconnaissance to locate the flanks drive
out the enemy and develop the situation reporting results to
the advance party commander
(g) If the enemy resistance is too strong to be overcome
by the advance party each element will hold its most advanced
position and cover the approach of rear elements
of the advance guard or of the main body
(h) In advance guards where there is no support the
tank platoon may be left as a containing force while the
main body bypasses the enemy position
k Support -( ) The support bears the same relation to
the elements in its front and rear as the advance party does
to the point and support It extends the reconnaissance
(maneuvering) or acts as the holding (pivot) element (See
fig 2 ) In the absence of a reserve it is also the principal
striking element Its principal duties are to-
(a) Maintain connection with the advance party and assist
it in overcoming enemy resistance
(b) Extend the flank reconnaissance to a distance of about
mile
(c) Check the enemy's advance until the element next
in rear or the main body has time to prepare for action
In case the enemy encountered is too strong to be defeated
the support reports the fact to the next element in rear
protects it and extends reconnaissance
(2) In the execution of its duties the elements of the support
proceed as follows :
(a) March at the prescribed rate of march maintaining
the time distance in front of the reserve if present or the
main body It should not move on the next bound until the
preceding element has cleared
(b) Extends the reconnaissance to the flanks in a similar
manner to that of the tank platoon in the advance party
(c) When the enemy is encountered it reenforces the action
of the advance party whether it is combat reconnaissance
or both

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
The reserve -The reserve is the striking (main blow)
element of the advance guard Its employment is based on
the information obtained from the lesser forward elements
and other sources by the advance guard commander
m Artillery -In an advance guard for a regiment or larger
unit it will often be desirable to attach a battery of field
artillery When attached it will normally march as the
rear unit of the advance guard with a reconnaissance officer
well forward If no artillery is attached to the advance guard
the necessary artillery support for its action is furnished by
the artillery with the main body When the need for their
employment can be foreseen supporting antiaircraft artillery
may accompany the advance guard It occupies critical points
en route
n Aviation-While not normally attached to the advance
guard available airplanes should be directed to cooperate
They render valuable assistance by reporting direct to the
advance guard commander the approach of enemy forces the
location of hostile positions along the axis of advance pertinent
information of roads and bridges and other similar
information
o Engineers -Engineers march at the rear of the support
or near the head of the reserve Their principal functions
are to repair or strengthen bridges remove obstacles prepare
stream crossings and repair roads An engineer detachment
marches at the rear of the advance party ; its function is to
furnish early engineer information Where need for their use
can be foreseen engineers with bridge building equipment
may be attached to the rear element of an advance guard
p Medium tanks -In the absence of artillery with the
advance guard or where their use can be foreseen medium
tanks may be attached to the advance guard composed of
a light tank unit or a regiment or larger unit
q Mortars In an advance guard for a battalion or larger
unit the attachment of at least a squad of mortars is desirable
It is used to neutralize enemy observation posts and
screen the movement of advance guard units and later if
necessary the development of the main body
r Trains -The unit trains of an advance guard generally
remain with the trains of the main body A truck to transport
gasoline for refueling motorcycles should march at the
rear of the last element in the advance guard The light
5 4
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
36-37
maintenance elements of units performing advance guard
duty march in rear of their units
s Advance guard in retrograde movement -In retrograde
movements an advance guard 'should be detailed It will
vary from a point to a larger element depending on whether
or not there is a possibility of an enemy attack against the
head of the column If there is no enemy threat the principal
missions of the advance guard will be to clear the route
of march insure the uninterrupted movement of the main
body and regulate civilian and refugee traffic For the latter
purpose military police may be attached
t March outposts -Advance guards are used in forming
march outposts for temporary or prolonged halts (See par
40 )
â 37 COVERING DETACHMENTS-a General -( ) A covering
detachment is a security detachment used to protect troops
moving in the presence of the enemy
(2) It is used when early contact with the enemy is expected
and when because of this expectation the main body
is deployed in an approach formation
(3) A covering detachment is always used in an approach
to a line of departure
b 'Missions -The missions assigned to covering detachments
are similar to those given an advance guard except in
situations requiring combat strength The primary mission
is that of security ; the secondary mission is reconnaissance
Specifically its duties are to-
( ) Guard against surprise and obtain information by observing
to the front and flanks
(2) Cover a larger force in the approach to a line of
departure
(3) Guide a larger force over the best terrain available
(4) Push aside small enemy patrols and offer resistance
to larger hostile forces until the main body attacks
(5) Support the main body in an attack
c Strength and composition -A covering detachment for
a tank company usually consists of a platoon ; for a battalion
* platoon reinforced by detachments of the battalion headquarters
company; for 'an armored regiment a light tank
company reinforced
d Formations -( ) Formations for covering detachments
55

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
vary depending upon the terrain They are generally deployed
over a broad front with very little depth
(2) The interval between vehicles (squads) varies between
50 to 300 yards depending on terrain and visibility
e Communication and control -(l) Communication and
control are maintained normally by radio or prearranged
visual signals Exceptionally motorcycle or other vehicle
messengers may be employed
(2) Movement of the covering detachment is controlled by
the main force commander from his position in the interval
between the covering detachment and the main force
Methods of operation -( ) The covering detachment
precedes the unit from which it is detailed
(2) It moves by successive bounds the limitations of each
bound being indicated by the force commander and not by
the covering detachment commander
(3) Upon arriving at each terrain objective the covering
detachment halts and observes to the front and flanks until
ordered to make another indicated bound Full advantage is
taken of available cover
(4) Covering detachments attack small patrols and offer
resistance to larger forces
(5) Upon reaching the line of departure the covering
detachment may constitute the leading assault wave ; may
halt and support the attack by fire ; may afford flank and
rear protection ; or follow in support or reserve
g Reconnaissance -Reconnaissance elements may be attached
to a covering detachment the size of a company or
ordered to cooperate with a smaller covering detachment
When the terrain and road net are favorable early information
of hostile dispositions can be obtained by the reconnaissance
elements which enables a covering detachment to
better carry out its mission
E 38 REAR GUARDS -a General-A rear guard is a security
detachment which follows and covers the main body on the
march The fundamentals covering rear guards and rear
guard action are contained in FM 00-5
b Who may perform -Armored units are suitable to perform
rear guard duty because of their mobility and fire power
which enable them to withdraw quickly after delaying the
pursuing enemy to the last possible moment However this
56
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
38
use is exceptional and sacrifices their offensive power This
mission should not be assigned armored units when other suitable
units are available However the rear guard covering
the retirement of a combined force often contains armored
units
c Mission and duties -The mission of a rear guard is to
assure an uninterrupted movement of the main body and to
protect it from attack observation or interference by hostile
ground forces Specifically its duties are to-
( ) Guard against surprise and furnish information by
observing to the rear
(2) Hold back small forces of the enemy and prevent their
observing firing upon or delaying the main body
(3) Check an enemy in force until the main body has time
tc prepare for action march beyond the range of hostile fire
or occupy a position
(4) Provide suitable passive measures of opposition such as
interposing obstacles and destroying or damaging bridges and
roads
(5) Collect stragglers and lost vehicles and destroy
abandoned property
d Strength and composition -The strength and composition
of a rear guard for armored units depends upon the
mission;' direction of a march nature of the terrain and
upon the mobility and strength of hostile forces likely to be
encountered Its strength and composition should be such
as to permit the execution of its mission without the intervention
of the main body
( ) Strength -Its strength varies from a small fraction to
about one fourth of the command
(2) Composition -It normally is composed of machine gun
and tank elements It may be augmented by artillery and
mortar elements to provide greater combat power for reconnaissance
units ; and by engineers chemical and medical
troops At night it may be composed of infantry and engineer
elements and when the situation is obscure it should consist
primarily of armored or motorized infantry
e Formation -The rear guard formation resembles that of
an advance guard reversed Next behind the main body
marches the reserve followed in turn by the support rear
party and rear point In general the size of the rear guard
is smaller than an advance guard except in retrograde move-
57
3 8
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
ments When the size makes it impracticable to have all
the elements they are omitted in order of size beginning with
the reserve A rear point is always present
f Distances or time interval -On the march distances or
time intervals between the rear guard and the main body and
between subdivisions of the rear guard vary In general they
are governed by the size and mission of the rear guard by
visibility and terrain ; and by the strength composition mobility
and proximity of the enemy The distances and time
intervals previously outlined for advance guards may be taken
as a guide subject to the following :
( ) Support to reserve -The minimum distance between
the support and reserve is determined by the consideration
that the support must delay the enemy until the reserve can
prepare for action The maximum distance is that which the
reserve can take without exposing the support to the liability
of being cut off These distances may be greater in
open country or during daylight than under the opposite
conditions
(2) Reserve to main body -The minimum distance between
the reserve and the main body is determined by the consideration
that the rear guard must protect and not be driven back
upon the main body The maximum distance is that which
can separate the reserve and the main body without subjecting
the rear guard to the danger of being cut off by the enemy
It must not be such as will permit intervention of hostile
forces in strength between the reserve and the main body
g Rate of march -( ) The march order prescribes the rate
of march for the command and the time or distance between
the rear guard and the main body
(2) The elements of the rear guard usually retire by bounds
based on the progress of the main body and the time limit
set by the main body commander for holding designated lines
They may follow the main body at a steady rate of march
when conditions render the movement by bounds impractical
or unnecessary
h Communication and control -Communication and control
are maintained between the rear guard and the main
body and between subdivisions of the rear guard in the same
general manner as has been previously outlined for advance
guards
58
n
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
38
i Conduct of rear guard -( ) When the distance from the
enemy permits the rear guard retires in march formation
(2) When in contact with the enemy the rear guard moves
on a broad front and opens fire at long range to force the
enemy to deploy and thus delay his advance Unless the
security of the main body requires a stubborn resistance the
rear guard as far as practicable avoids close range combat
and withdraws successively from position to position as the
enemy approaches
(3) The rear guard fights in successive positions
(4) The rear guard commander makes timely provision
for preliminary reconnaissance of new positions and routes
thereto
(5) The successive positions of the rear guard are chosen
at such distance from each other that the enemy is forced
to renew his preparations for attack including forward displacement
of his artillery in each instance
(6) A rear guard position should favor withdrawal by affording
covered routes of withdrawal
(7) When the enemy presses his pursuit closely greater
resistance is offered Full use is made of surprise attacks
and ambushes to slow down or halt the hostile advance
(8) In general the main efforts of the rear guard like those
of any delaying force must be constantly directed toward
barring roads or other avenues of approach and denying or
disputing to the limit of available means their use by the
enemy forces
(9) Hostile mechanized elements usually attempt to attack
from the flank Against such forces care must be taken to
prevent dispersion of the rear guard in order that it may be
able to repel flank attacks and avoid being cut off from the
main body
( 0) Advantage is taken of favorable opportunities to
punish over-hasty pursuit by counterattacks against the heads
of pursuing columns or against hostile forces attacking from
the flank Ambush of leading hostile elements will be effective
in slowing down and punishing a hasty enemy Such
tactics will cause the enemy to be more cautious and consequently
slower in action
( ) A rear guard resorts to such defensive measures for
halting or delaying the enemy as obstructing fords executing
59
38
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
demolitions within the capabilities of the rear guard felling
trees across the road burning stretches of grass or shrubs
or by the use of persistent chemicals
f Duties of rear guard elements -( ) (a) In general
each rear guard element maintains connection with the
next lower element and by fire action or otherwise assists
it in effecting withdrawal
(b) Each element observes or reconnoiters to its own rear
and flanks and furnishes timely information of the enemy
situation to the next higher commander
(c) Each element covers the retirement and cooperates in
the fulfillment of the mission of its next higher element
(d) Each element in falling back avoids masking the fire
or interfering with the action of the elements covering its
withdrawal
(e) Limited flank reconnaissance for their own protection
is performed by elements of the rear guard When special
flank reconnaissance is necessary it is performed by reconnaissance
units attached to the rear guard or by patrols detailed
for this purpose from the reserve or main body
(2) The principal duties of the rear guard elements are
as follows :
(a) Rear point -The rear point is a patrol from the rear
party and follows the rear party en route It adheres closely
to the route of retirement observing constantly to the flanks
and rear to detect hostile moves It discourages pursuit by
firing upon hostile elements
(b) Rear party-The rear party a subdivision of the support
follows and protects the support It endeavors to delay
a closely pursuing enemy by long-range fire It covers the
withdrawal of the rear point by engaging the enemy by fire
alone or by fire and movement When necessary it maneuvers
at distances up to about 800 yards on either side of
the axis of movement
(c) Support -The support is the smallest element of the
rear guard capablie:of offering the enemy serious resistance
It follows the reserve en route or the main body when no
reserve is present When no reserve is present it performs
the duties that normally devolve upon the reserve It delays
the enemy usually by means of long-range fire in successive
positions ; it covers the occupation of delaying positions by
the reserve ; it covers the withdrawal of the rear party by
60
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
38
fire alone or by fire and movement It may operate as much
as mile to either side of the route
(d) Reserve-The reserve normally the strongest element
of the rear guard constitutes its chief maneuvering force
It is a duty of the reserve in particular to detect the presence
of any hostile forces attempting an encircling maneuver
It delays the enemy by means of all available fire power and
when occasion demands by offensive action in cooperation
with the support In case the situation requires the rear
guard to effect a long delay of the enemy force the reserve
under protection of the support occupies strong delaying
positions It maneuvers as necessary to either side of the
route
k Artillery -Field artillery may be attached to the rear
guard for a regiment or larger unit When attached it generally
marches near the head of the largest element of the
rear guard Because of its great range artillery can force
the enemy off roads before he is within range of small arms
fire and can compel him to march across country in deployed
formation or to use circuitous routes in order to obtain
cover
Aviation-While not normally attached to the rear
guard observation airplanes operate in close liaison with its
commander They keep him informed of the strength composition
location and movements of enemy forces They
assist whenever necessary in maintaining liaison between
the main body and the rear guard Some airplanes usually
are placed at the disposal of the artillery with rear guards
to observe their long-range fires
m Chemical troops-Detachments of chemical troops
may be attached to a rear guard for the purpose of delaying
the enemy by the use of persistent chemicals or other chemical
ammunition Smoke may also be used to assist the elements
of the rear guard in concealing their movements during
successive withdrawals When attached chemical troops
should march with the reserve
n Engineers-When available engineers should be attached
to the rear guard to complete demolitions or the installation
of obstacles which may have been prepared by
preceding engineer troops
o Medical troops -Sufficient medical troops are attached
439995`-42-5 6
38-39
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
to the forward elements of the rear guard to care for probable
casualties
p Medium tanks -Medium tank units may be attached to
the rear guard for an armored regiment or larger unit when
there is no artillery attached or when a mechanized threat
exists
q Mortars In the absence of chemical troops the attachment
of at least a platoon of mortars to the support of a rear
guard for a regiment or larger unit to furnish smoke is
desirable
r Reconnaissance units ( ) Divisional reconnaissance
units are seldom attached to rear guards In a withdrawal
divisional reconnaissance units between the enemy and the
rear guard keep the rear guard commander informed of the
strength composition location and movement of enemy
forces
(2) A portion of the regimental reconnaissance company
may frequently be attached When attached to rear guards
these units are of great assistance in performing flank reconnaissance
and in obtaining early information of encircling
maneuvers They generally move abreast of the rear guard
on parallel roads or cross country
s Trains -The unit trains of the rear guard should march
at the rear of main body In general maintenance elements
of the rear guard march as far to the rear as is consistent
with the tactical situation Usually maintenance vehicles
with the reserve will march at the rear of the reserve while
maintenance vehicles of other elements march at the head
of their respective units
t March outposts -Rear guards are used in forming march
outposts (See par 40 )
â 39 FLANK GUARDS-a General -( ) A flank guard is a
security detachment detailed to protect the flank of a marching
force The fundamentals covering flank guards and
flank guard action are contained in FM 00-5
(2) Because of their high degree of mobility armored
units are especially suitable to perform flank guard duty
However tank units must not be used for that duty when such
employment will materially reduce their offensive power
or when other suitable troops are available for such duty
(3) When the protection usually afforded by adjacent units

or obstacles is absent a flank guard may be necessary
b Mission -The mission of a flank guard is to insure the
uninterrupted advance or retirement of a force and to protect
it from attack observation or harassment by hostile
ground forces from the flank Its duties are similar to those
of advance and rear guards
c Strength and composition -The strength and composition
of a flank guard varies according to the situation from
a patrol to a force of all arms When the main body executes
a flank march in proximity of the enemy flank protection
assumes great importance ; a strong flank guard is
detailed
d Distance-U) Since the mission of a flank guard is to
protect the flank of a marching column it is interposed between
this column and the located or anticipated hostile
threats The distance of operation to the flank will vary

advisable to placeoutguards in positions different from those occupied duringthe day Outguards are numbered consecutively from rightto left in each support The number and size of outguardsemployed will depend upon the strength of the support terrain and actions of the enemy Outguards must be readyfor action at all times In every case the outguard commander must understand what he is to do in an emergencyVehicles of the outguard may be with the support or keptunder cover near the outguard(d) Sentinels -Sentinels are posted from outguards eithersingly or in pairs On sentinel posts from the larger outguards it is customary to use one sentinel in the daytime andtwo at night Sentinels are located in concealed positionswhich afford an unobstructed view They must be nearenough to their leader to attract his attention without leaving their post They are charged with the observation of aportion of the foreground of the outpost position with thediscovery of hostile activity and with giving the alarm incase of attack Sentinels are given the following information :Number of their relief outguard and support2 Direction and probable route of approach of theenemy3 Names of features of

powerand facilities for rapid communication of armored forceunits the distance between subdivisions of the outpost maybe considerably greater than in less mobile troops Armoredforce units can quickly support an outpost line of resistanceat a distance from the bivouac of a command The line ofobservation when practicable should be at sufficient distance to keep hostile light artillery beyond the range of thebivouac area9 Communication and contact-( ) Communication between the main body and the outpost and between subdivisions of the outpost are maintained in the same generalmanner as has been previously described for all securitydetachments(2) Within the outpost position contact with advance elements and with adjacent supports and outguards is maintained by patrols(3) Visual signals such as ground projector signals orimprovised alarms may be utilized in accordance with a prearranged code to warn of the approach of hostile ground orair forcesh Conduct -The conduct of an outpost depends primarilyon the contemplated employment of the main body Theplan of action of the main body may require the lineofresistance to be held at all costs or the outpost and securitydetachments may be

" main force
(2) Large flank guards should be far enough out to the
flank to prevent hostile artillery or antitank weapons from
placing effective fire on the main body Small flank guard
patrol should be far enough out to protect the command
from enemy machine gun and antitank gun fire
(3) Distance between elements of the flank guard on the
march may conform to those between elements of an advance
or rear guard When continuous flank protection is required
the flank guard is distributed in detachments to give
protection throughout the length of the main body Critical
areas (key positions) controlling avenues of approach may
be occupied and held until the main body has passed (See
g below )
e Rate of march -( ) The rate of march of the flank
guard conforms generally to that of the main body
(2) When movement of the flank guard is by bounds the
rate of march will be based on the progress of the main body
or the time limit set by the main body commander for holding
specific localities or points
f Communication and control -( ) The communication
facilities afforded by the use of radio aviation motor and
motorcycle messengers enable the flank guard commander to
maintain contact with the main body
63
39 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(2) Where the terrain permits contact with the main body
may be maintained through connecting groups
(3) Contact is frequently gained with flank guards and
their movement controlled by the main body commander on
designated phase lines or objectives
(4) Communication and control are maintained between
subdivisions of the flank guard in the same manner as has
previously been outlined for advance guards
g Conduct of flank guard -( ) Flank guards are conducted
with especial reference to routes or localities which favor
attack against the flanks of a command
(2) When a route generally parallel to the line of march
of the main body exists and more or less continuous flank
protection is required throughout the depth of the column
during the march the flank guard marches parallel to the
main body to cover possible routes of hostile attack Except
as indicated below it is distributed in echelons over
sufficient depth to offer resistance to attack at various points
on the flank of the main body and to prevent inroads of
small hostile detachments
(3) When the locality from which an attack is to be expected
is well defined a flank guard occupies a key position
covering the routes of approach to the main body until the
command has passed
(4) When several such locations must be passed during
the progress of a march echelons of the flank guard move
by bounds from one position to another
(5) Upon arrival at a locality dispositions are made to
hold that position as long as may be necessary to allow the
main body to march out of danger The flank guard or
echelon thereof then moves to the next locality
(6) When the enemy is encountered the flank guard may
act offensively delay in successive positions or defend a
position as the situation may require
(7) In addition to the normal methods of performing flank
guard duties where considerable doubt exists as to the most
likely avenue of hostile approach a flank guard may resort
to a position of readiness at some conveniently located point
If sufficiently strong it may occupy two or more key positions
covering the most probable routes of approach In the latter
case a highly mobile reserve should be held at a convenient

location to move rapidly to oppose the enemy when his line
of approach is known
h Artillery -Artillery is usually attached to flank guards
required to operate beyond effective supporting distance of the
artillery in the main column or to combat hostile forces
likely to be accompanied by mechanized elements
i Medium tanks -Medium tank units may be attached to
large flank guards for a combat command or division when
there is danger of attack by hostile mechanized elements
5 Aviation -Although observation airplanes are not normally
attached to flank guards they cooperate with them in
the same manner as with advance guards and rear guards
In some situations flank guards may be supported by combat
aviation
k Other auxiliary troops -Other auxiliary troops such as
engineer chemical warfare and medical units are attached
in accordance with their need as the situation in each instance
may demand
Reconnaissance units -( ) Divisional reconnaissance
units are seldom attached to flank guards In a withdrawal
these units cooperate with or may even supplant flank guards
(2) A portion of the regimental reconnaissance unit may
frequently be attached When attached to flank guards these
units are used to conduct reconnaissance to locate hostile
threats or to seize and hold critical points prior to their
occupation by the flank guard proper Exceptionally may they be employed to delay the enemy from localities too
distant for the flank guard to occupy
m Trains -Unit trains of the flank guard march with the trains of the main body The maintenance elements of units
performing flank guard duty accompany their units
IN 40 OUTPOSTS -a General -( ) An outpost is a security
detachment to protect a resting command or a defensive position
against annoyance surprise and observation by ground
forces
(2) The presence of hostile mechanized units necessitates
all-around security
(3) In order to obtain cover and concealment against air attack units may ha5e to disperse over a large area
(4) When armored force units are attached to other ground forces they may depend upon the general security furnished
65
40 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
by the force to which they are attached However they provide
their own local security including security against hostile
mechanized elements and aviation
(5) When operating alone or at too great a distance from
the force to which they are attached to be furnished adequate
security by them armored force units provide their own allaround
security This paragraph covers the security of
armored force units when they furnish their own security
b Types-( ) Outposts at halt and in bivouac -At a halt
during the course of a march the advance guard or rear
guard or both establish a march outpost consisting of observation
posts at commanding points and combat patrols at
critical terrain features The support usually furnishes this
outpost In bivouac while the outpost is being established
advance flank and rear guards provide security
(2) Combat outposts-When operations are interrupted by
a halt for reorganization or by nightfall and troops are required
to bivouac in battle formation companies or battalions
cover their sectors by means of a security detachment termed
a combat outpost Provision is made for patrolling the foreground
and intervals between tactical localities Contact with
the enemy must be maintained The action of the several
combat outposts is coordinated by the commander of the
whole force The flanks and rear must also be covered with
security detachments
c Strength and composition-( ) The strength and composition
as well as the disposition organization and conduct
of an outpost depend upon the following considerations :
(a) Special mission assigned the outpost i e march combat
or outpost for a prolonged halt
(b) Proximity strength composition mobility and attitude
of the enemy
(c) Size and composition of the whole command
(d) Tactical dispositions of the main body
(e) Front to be covered and the distance of the outpost
from the main body
(f) Nature of the terrain especially the road net and
natural obstacles
(2) Strength -An outpost is given sufficient strength to
enable it to accomplish its mission but is made no stronger
than is consistent with reasonable security
(3) Composition -Outposts for large armored force units

are composed principally of infantry ments and machine gun ele- augmented by reconnaissance artillery and engineer elements In smaller units such as an armored regiment they are normally composed of machine gun elements For armored units smaller than a regiment see chapter 5 d Outpost dispositions -The degree of organization of the Outpost depends upon whether or not contact with the enemy is remote or imminent or whether forces are in actual con- tact The basic consideration is that a command must not allow itself to be surprised
( ) When contact is remote -The time distance from the enemy varies with the rate of march of the enemy troops that may move against the command When contact is remote security is provided by far reaching reconnaissance ; by depth of depositions and location of units in the bivouac ; and by sending out detached posts to hold critical points on routes of approach from the front flanks and rear These detached posts preferably are along some protective terrain line that the enemy will be forced to pass in his advance (defiles stream crossings) They provide local security by posting outguards and sending out patrols Additional out- guards are posted near the bivouac area (2) When contact is imminent -When the enemy is so close that contact can be expected at any moment a more highly organized Outpost system is prescribed Combat units may be assigned sectors for which to furnish security These sectors are assigned by the senior commander and include the bivouac area of the combat unit When sectors are so assigned the dispositions of troops in the bivouac area must be such that combat units encircle the noncombatant elements present ; and sectors must be contiguous When necessary portions of the main body are held in readiness for immediate action
(3) In close contact with enemy -When in close contact with the enemy a complete Outpost is organized as described in subsequent subparagraphs Such circumstances will be exceptional since armored force units when they pass to the defensive should be replaced by other ground forces and withdrawn to conserve their strength for a resumption of the offensive (See ch ) However when armored force units in contact with the enemy have outdistanced the ground forces to which they are attached it may be necessary to

bivouac to assemble and to reorganize and service the vehicles
pending relief by other ground forces Either an
organized outpost or combat outposts will then have to be
established depending upon the hostile situation The provisions
outlined in FM 00-5 pertaining to supports outguards
sentinels detached posts and patrols applicable to
outpost dispositions are made
e Organization of outposts -An outpost position should be
selected because of its facilities for observation and its suitability
for defense Two lines are usually established I e
a line of observation and a line of resistance The position is
organized in depth in such manner as to place between the
main body and the enemy a series of groups which the enemy
must attack successively as he advances The closer to the
main body the stronger the group
( ) Line of observation The line of observation consists
of small groups (outguards) charged with observing and reporting
any hostile advance This line is extended well to the
front on terrain commanding an unobstructed view of the
front particularly avenues of approach and of the intervening
terrain
(2) Line of resistance -The outpost line of resistance consists
of larger groups (supports) posted on the best defensive
ground encircling the bivouac areas During the hours of
daylight the outpost line of resistance for armored force units
of a regiment or larger are usually at some distance from
the main body Full advantage is taken of all obstacles At
night since it is not practical to build up a line of resistance
in advance of the bivouac by attempting to maneuver heavier
elements of the command forward to that line during the
hours of darkness the line of resistance may be increased in
strength ; or the line of resistance may be established by the
disposition of combat units in bivouac This may be obtained
by providing close-in protection with the guns of the vehicles
sighted for all-around defense with personnel bivouacked at
their vehicles
(3) Subdivisions of outposts-The usual subdivisions of an
outpost from rear to front are reserve supports and outguards
In case of attack the primary duty of each subdivision
in front is to gain time for the element next in rear
to prepare for action Elements in rear reinforce elements
in front In occupying their positions and during relief the

various subdivisions of the outpost conceal their movements
against both air and ground observation The outpost troops
ordinarily stand relieved when the support of the advance
guard passes the outpost line of resistance
(a) Reserve-The reserve which constitutes the main
force of the outpost is held at some central point from
which it can support the troops on the main line of resistance
It renders support by reinforcement or by counterattack
In case the outpost is assigned a delaying mission it holds
a rallying position upon which the more advanced elements
may retire in the event of a hostile attack in force Its
strength varies from one-fourth to two-thirds of the outpost
strength The reserve is marched to its post by its commander
who then sends out such detachments as have been
ordered and places the remainder at rest He stations sentinels
at the post of the reserve He establishes connection
with the supports and nearby detached posts Each unit of
the reserve is informed of its place of formation and action
in case of hostile attack and the general action expected
of the reserve
(b) Supports -The supports constitute a line of supporting
and resisting elements They are usually located on or
near the line of resistance along prominent terrain features
or clearly defined points such as buildings bridges or road
Junctions so as to cover likely avenues of approach Strength
is concentrated at the most important points the remainder
being covered by small detachments patrols and weapons
previously sighted in positions Supports vary in strength
from a platoon to a company The strength armament terrain
and extent of the outpost sector control the distance
between adjacent supports Each support is organized as
a defense area It commands an adequate field of fire the to front and the intervals between adjacent supports
Each support is assigned a sector clearly defined by means of readily distinguishable terrain features Sector bound- aries are so arranged and so designated that responsibility
for covering roads sensitive points and likely avenues of hostile approach is never divided Supports are numbered
consecutively from right to left in the outpost Each sup- port commander stations at least one sentinel at the post of the support details outguards to cover the front of the sup-

port and makes provision for patrolling- including visiting
lateral patrols
(c) Outguards -Outguards are detailed from supports to
occupy vantage points on the line of observation They vary
in strength from four men to a platoon depending on their
location distance from the support and the number of
sentries they are to furnish An outguard of four men includes
a leader and maintains three reliefs of single sentinels
A squad posted in observation maintains single or double
sentinels Larger outguards protect themselves by sentinel
posts of half squad or squad groups and patrols depending
on the situation At night it is frequently advisable to place
outguards in positions different from those occupied during
the day Outguards are numbered consecutively from right
to left in each support The number and size of outguards
employed will depend upon the strength of the support terrain
and actions of the enemy Outguards must be ready
for action at all times In every case the outguard commander
must understand what he is to do in an emergency
Vehicles of the outguard may be with the support or kept
under cover near the outguard
(d) Sentinels -Sentinels are posted from outguards either
singly or in pairs On sentinel posts from the larger outguards
it is customary to use one sentinel in the daytime and
two at night Sentinels are located in concealed positions
which afford an unobstructed view They must be near
enough to their leader to attract his attention without leaving
their post They are charged with the observation of a
portion of the foreground of the outpost position with the
discovery of hostile activity and with giving the alarm in
case of attack Sentinels are given the following information
:
Number of their relief outguard and support
2 Direction and probable route of approach of the
enemy
3 Names of features of military importance such as
roads villages or streams
4 Location of the support or other units of which the
outguard is an outpost element and the location of
adjacent outguards

(4) Detached posts -Detached posts are observation and
combat groups detailed for the purpose of occupying points
which possess special importance to the security of the command
but which are too remote to be included in the normal
outpost organization Detached posts are given sufficient
strength to maintain themselves and to furnish the necessary
observation
Distances -Because of the mobility organic fire power
and facilities for rapid communication of armored force
units the distance between subdivisions of the outpost may
be considerably greater than in less mobile troops Armored
force units can quickly support an outpost line of resistance
at a distance from the bivouac of a command The line of
observation when practicable should be at sufficient distance
to keep hostile light artillery beyond the range of the
bivouac area
9 Communication and contact-( ) Communication between
the main body and the outpost and between subdivisions
of the outpost are maintained in the same general
manner as has been previously described for all security
detachments
(2) Within the outpost position contact with advance elements
and with adjacent supports and outguards is maintained
by patrols
(3) Visual signals such as ground projector signals or
improvised alarms may be utilized in accordance with a prearranged
code to warn of the approach of hostile ground or
air forces
h Conduct -The conduct of an outpost depends primarily
on the contemplated employment of the main body The
plan of action of the main body may require the line of
resistance to be held at all costs or the outpost and security
detachments may be required to delay in order to afford the
main body time to prepare for action or withdrawal The
course of action to be followed is prescribed by the commander
of the force
i Obstacles -Obstacles (road blocks) constructed from
7
40
material found on the ground are placed on roads in front
of outguards and supports where they may effectively delay
the enemy advance Such obstacles must be covered by
fire Obstacles are placed by the outpost troops with the
assistance of engineers They are located to take full advantage
of defiles Mines are used freely (See FM 5-30 )
j Terrain -Terrain feature are utilized to the maximum
extent in providing protection and in making dispositions
Terrain should be selected for positions that will cover avenues
of approach provide an adequate field of fire to the
front and cover the interval between adjacent elements
Covered routes of withdrawals from positions should be selected
and reconnoitered in advance
k Vehicles -The minimum number of vehicles necessary
for patrolling communication and transportation of personnel
remain with the subdivisions of the outpost When
not employed they are concealed Remaining vehicles are
left with the vehicles of their unit
Identification of friendly vehicles -Some means of identifying
friendly vehicles approaching outguards from the direction
of the enemy must be improvised and understood
by all sentinels and the crews of vehicles A simple prearranged
code that can be flashed by a light and seen at a
distance will serve to warn of the approach of friendly vehicles
at night Along routes that are likely to be used by
vehicles It may often be preferable to post an additional
sentinel a hundred yards or so in advance of the outguard
to flash a light on all vehicles to insure identification If
an enemy vehicle is identified the outguard is warned by
the sentinel giving a prearranged signal
m Artillery-Support of the outpost troops is usually provided
by the artillery with the main body or that assigned
to the defense of the main position Batteries are specially
designated for this purpose in case such action is contemplated
If such support is impractical artillery may be
attached to the outpost
n Aviation -Observation aviation provides additional surveillance
and cooperates with outpost troops in the same
manner as with advance flank and rear guards
o Engineers -Engineers are attached to the outpost as
required for the repair or destruction of bridges and roads
and for the construction of obstacles mine fields and other
barriers

p Other auxiliary troops -Other auxiliary troops such as
chemical warfare and medical units are attached to large
outposts in accordance with their needs as the situation in
each case demands
q Reconnaissance units -( ) Divisional reconnaissance
units are seldom attached to outposts They execute distant
reconnaissance regulated by the higher commander (See
sec II )
(2) A portion of the regimental reconnaissance unit may
be attached to extend the zone of reconnaissance of an outpost
to the front and flanks
(3) All reconnaissance elements maintain close contact
with the enemy when combat outposts or outposts for the
night are established During the hours of darkness unless
an emergency calls for other action reconnaissance elements
not in contact are habitually withdrawn to the bivouac area
of the main body Elements in contact with the enemy
maintain observation of the enemy with the minimum personnel
required while the remainder of the element rests
in concealed bivouac in the vicinity
r Trains -Trains of outpost elements remain at the service
park of their unit bivouac
s Supply and maintenance -The feeding of personnel and
maintenance of vehicles on outpost duty in armored force
units at a distance from their bivouac areas and service
parks may offer a difficult problem The following methods
may be taken as a guide :
( ) Rations fuel and lubricants may be transported in
containers to the various elements Necessary servicing is
performed by the crews with vehicles concealed at the outpost
position
(2) In proximity to or in close contact with the enemy
feeding and servicing may have to be accomplished prior
to the element being posted if sufficient warning is given
or after the element has been relieved from outpost duty and
has been withdrawn Elements may have to exist on their
reserve rations and carry the necessary fuel and lubricants
in containers with them in the combat vehicles
(3) When practical and at not too great a distance from
the element in rear : personnel and vehicles may return to
the rear element in relays for feeding and servicing
(4) Maintenance other than first echelon maintenance
73

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
normally is not performed at outpost positions If such maintenance
is essential vehicles requiring it should be replaced
by other vehicles prior to going on outpost duty
a 4 CoUNTERRECONNAISSANcE -a General -( ) Counterreconnaissance
includes the measures to screen a command
from hostile observation Armored force units when operating
alone provide when necessary their own counterreconnaissance
screen The screening of other troops by
armored units is usually incidental to other missions
(2) Counterreconnaissance missions may be assigned
whether the force to be screened is advancing withdrawing
moving laterally or is at a halt
(3) Air superiority is essential to prevent observation by
hostile aviation
b Missions and duties -Counterreconnaissance missions
may be to screen a force in movement (moving screen) ; or
to screen the disposition or concentration of troops (stationary
screen) Specifically the duties of counterreconnaissance
elements are :
( ) To prevent hostile patrols from working through the
screen
(2) To prevent a hostile penetration in force
(3) To engage the enemy in such a manner as to prevent
or limit his observation of a certain area or beyond a certain
line
c Strength -The strength of a screening force as well as
the number of security detachments employed and the frontage
and depth to be covered depends upon the following
principal factors :
( ) Strength composition dispositions and mobility of
the enemy
(2) Kind of screen to be established i e moving or stationary
(3) Size and tactical dispositions of the force being
screened
(4) Nature of the terrain particularly the road net
d Composition --Counterreconnaissance in an armored
division is executed principally by reconnaissance infantry
and attached aviation elements while the remaining combat
elements of the division reinforce from a central location
the screen as necessary In smaller units such as an
74
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
4
armored regiment it is normally executed by reconnaissance
and tank units Units smaller than a regiment may have
appropriate elements attached for the purpose
e Organization o/ counterreconnaissance screen -When a
commander assigns a counterreconnaissance mission to a
force he may designate a zone or sector to be covered by
the counterreconnaissance screen This zone or sector is covered
by security detachments known as counterreconnaissance
detachments which in turn send out counterreconnaissance
patrols Reconnaissance to a distance beyond the
screen under the control of the commander of the counterreconnaissance
force is performed by reconnaissance units
The main body of the counterreconnaissance force marches
or remains in a central location behind the counterreconnaissance
detachments It supports the counterreconnaissance
detachments as the situations may require
/ Zones and sectors -( ) If the mission calls for screening
a moving force a zone of action is usually prescribed
(2) If the mission calls for the establishment of a stationary
screen 'the instructions designate the general line and
sector to be screened A stationary screen is similar to an
outpost
g Frontage and depth -( ) A counterreconnaissance force
is disposed to cover the entire front and in sufficient depth
to give the commander thereof time to concentrate an adequate
force to prevent a hostile penetration of the screen
Those parts of the front or area most vulnerable to hostile
reconnaissance receive special attention in the disposal of
the counterreconnaissance force
(2) The following may be taken as a guide for the frontage
that can normally be effectively covered in a moving screen
by units of the infantry or reconnaissance elements of the
armored division :

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(3) In a stationary screen these frontages may be increased
by approximately 25 percent
h Moving and stationary counterreconnaissance (l) In
a moving screen the elements of a counterreconnaissance
force usually move by bounds Patrols operating on a broad
front move from one coordinating or phase line at specified
times to another Counterreconnaissance detachments
keeping within supporting distance of their patrols and the
main body move from one suitable defensive terrain feature
to another In marches of more than one column the movement
of the main body is usually coordinated by the designation
of specific lines to be reached by heads of columns
at specified hours
(2) In a stationary screen counterreconnaissance elements
are posted to block the advance of the hostile reconnaissance
Maximum advantage is taken of terrain obstacles and defended
road blocks Patrols must be supported promptly to
prevent penetration of the screen
i Counterreconnaissance detachments -( ) The duties of
counterreconnaissance detachments are primarily to prevent
reconnaissance by the enemy's ground troops and to deny
the transmission of information to the enemy They are
habitually assigned zones of action or sectors
(2) The strength of a counterreconnaissance detachment
depends chiefly upon the width of the zone of action or
the frontage assigned and the number of patrols it must
furnish to accomplish its mission These in turn depend upon
the strength of the hostile forces likely to be encountered
the terrain and road net and the nature of the screen to
be established The strength may vary from a platoon to
a battalion
(3) In general counterreconnaissance detachments will
normally be used to :
(a) Prevent smaller hostile patrols from penetrating the
zone of action or sector assigned
(b) Destroy or drive off small hostile detachments
(c) Locate and delay the advance of larger detachments
(d) Reinforce or form rallying points for their own
patrols
(e) Maintain liaison within that part of the screen established
by the detachment as well as with adjacent detachments

deep formation is used Thisformation gives the maximum control and flexibility Whena limited objective attack is to be made such as in withdrawala broad formation may be used This formation is difficultto control Echelon formation is suitable for flank protection units being echeloned toward the flank to be protected(b) Tank units are arranged in the attack formation inaccordance with the plan of attack They advance to theirobjectives by a combination of fire and movement Withinthe platoons the intervals and distances between tanks isnot to be less than 50 yards when supporting other groundtroops , otherwise not less than 75 yards The distance between successive waves must not be less than 50 yards(2) Light tanks -The primary mission of the light tankunits is to close with the enemy and to disrupt the hostileorganization in vital rear areas by fast bold action Thisis accomplished by destroying hostile automatic weapons andpersonnel , disrupting communications , and overrunningcommand posts artillery positions reserves and other installations essential to the enemy(3) Medium tanks -(a) The primary mission of mediumtank units is to assist the attack of the light tank unitschiefly by neutralizing or destroying the hostile antitankweapons When organized resistance is encountered especially antitank guns medium tank units will usually precedethe light tank units for this purpose The use of one or moreplatoons of medium tanks following the attack of light tankunits for supporting fire will frequently be desirable Tanksso employed for short periods should assume turret defiladerpTACTICS AND TECHNIQUE46positions from which they can bring direct fire to bear onhostile antitank weapons as they are found(b) Medium tanks also protect the light tanks against theattack of hostile tanks When the enemy is composed ofmechanized troops a large medium tank component if available is held in the reserve(4) For further details on the employment of tanks seechs 5 7 2 and 3i Heavy tank destroyer battalions -( ) OrganizationThis battalion consists of a headquarters company and threeheavy tank destroyer companies The company has twoheavy and one light platoon of four guns each(2) Missions -(a) The mission of the tank destroyer withthe armored division is to assist either by offensive or defensive action in the protection of the division against hostilemechanized forces(b) The battalion may be used toProtect a bivouac assembly area or rallying point2 Guard an exposed flank3 Protect the rear of the division(c) The battalion may be used as a unit or companies maybe attached to armored regiments or combat commandsExcept wheb actually emplaced to protect a bivouac assemblyarea or rallying point tank destroyer units should be held inmobile reserve prepared to move promptly to any threatenedarea(3) Reconnaissance -Reconnaissance for positions androutes thereto is continuous during the advanceInformation gained is immediately transmitted to the battalion headquarters or the company concerned Battalions and company reconnaissance personnel supplements the reconnaissance of units to which the battalion or its companies areattached Close cooperation must be maintained with observation aviation(4) Liaison -The battalion sends a liaison officer to theunit to which it is attached and each company sends liaisonpersonnel to the unit to which it is attached Close liaisonmust be maintained in order that the tank destroyer unitsmay act promptly(5) Advance -During the advance the tank destroyer unitsmove usually as a unit near the head of the unit to whichthey are attached A detachment or the whole battalion9,,46ARMOREDFORCE FIELD MANUALmay be used to guard an exposed flank In this case theyare usually attached to or act as flank guard When thearmored units go into assembly areas tank destroyers immediately place guns in position to cover likely avenues of approach for attacking armored units A portion of the battalion or company is held in mobile reserve ready to reinforceany threatened point(6) During combat -Tank destroyer units may advancebehind the second echelon of attack usually the second armored battalion in depth They are prepared to repel counterattacks from the flanks and rear The greater part of theunit should if terrain is suitable be near the exposed flank(7) During reorganization -As the attack progresses thetank units in rear will pass through the destroyer units toenter combat After the objective is reached the tank destroyer units move rapidly forward and cover the rallyingpoint to protect the reorganization(8) In defenseIn defense the tank destroyer battalionis usually kept intact in mobile reserve In such position thatit may move promptly to any threatened point to repel acounterattack Tank destroyer units are not ordinarily attached to lower units and emplaced as stationary antitankguns in defense Their mobility is preserved(9) Retrograde movements -In retrograde movementstank destroyer units are usually attached to the rear guardThey are held mobile ready to repel enemy armored units( 0) River crossings -In river crossings tank destroyerunits should cross the river immediately after the infantry inorder to repel hostile armored counterattacks( ) The employment of the tank destroyer company iscovered in chapter 7j Artillery -( ) Role -The role of the armored artilleryis to support the armored division and its elements in theconduct of highly mobile ground warfare primarily offensivein character(2) Sources of fire missions-The sources of artillery firemissions are :(a) Artillery forward observers (with advance elements ofdivision) -The armored vehicle serves as an armored observation post for these observers Radio is the means ofcommunication(b) Air observation -Air observers report directly to theTACTICS AND TECHNIQUE46particular artillery echelon with which they are functioningPrearrangement of plans and definite assignment of zones ofresponsibility for observation and fire are essential(c) Artillery liaison officers -Artillery liaison officers accompany the armored unit commanders Flexibility in plansand fire support by the artillery are thus facilitated(3) On the march -The armored division usually advancesin multiple columns When contact is imminent for any column its advance guard moves on a broad front Artilleryusually supports this type of action by immediate occupationof a position Continuous support is effected by displacementby echelon The artillery must be prepared to place fire onthe principal routes leading toward the marching columnsfrom the front and flanks If no special use for the battery iscontemplated it Is left under artillery control with limitations placed on its employment and displacement(4) In assembly areas and bivouac -When armored forcesare in assembly areas or bivouac artillery is postedto coverall approaches to the area Positions are selected from whichit may bring

such detachments The strength of a patrol varies from half
a squad to a platoon with its organic weapons Normally
vehicles operate in pairs
(2) In general the conduct of counterreconnaissance patrols
whether in moving or in stationary screens is similar
(a) In a moving screen patrols move along routes which
enable them to keep under observation the likely routes of hostile advance They patrol laterally to adjacent patrols (b) In stationary screens patrols are posted at observation points from which they can view routes of hostile approach Active patrolling between adjoining groups is maintained k Instructions to counterreconnÂ¢issance detachments - Instructions to the commander of the detachment include ; ( ) Time of starting
(2) Zone of action (for moving screen)
(3) Sector and line of observation and defense (stationary screen)
(4) Coordinating lines and time to be passed (for moving screen)
(5) Special reconnaissance desired
(6) Procedure if enemy is met in force
(7) Lines of communication ; responsibility for liaison be- tween detachments
Methods of operation -In performing counterreconnais- sance missions units seek to defeat or neutralize hostile re- connaissance forces In the execution of this mission they operate offensively defensively or by delaying action re- sorting to all forms of combat when necessary Hostile avia- tion is fired upon within range unless prohibited in orders
77

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
( ) Counterreconnaissance detachments attack hostile
detachments whenever and wherever found
(2) When hostile reconnaissance forces are superior in
strength or the screen must cover a broad front the screening
force may have to resort to defensive or delaying action
as a means of temporarily impeding the operations of hostile
reconnaissance forces Defensive action is most effective
when the screen or an element thereof can be established
behind an obstacle such as a stream defile or road block
which must be crossed or passed by the enemy
an Artillery -The artillery with armored force units on a
counterreconnaissance mission is used to support the screening
force When the screen is moving artillery generally
accompanies the main body In cases where the defense of
a screen has become necessary or advisable all or part of the
artillery may be placed in position for the support of the
screen or may be held with the main body prepared to move
to the support of any part of the screen which may be
threatened
n Aviation -Aviation assists counterreconnaissance forces
by attacking hostile aviation attempting to cross the area
of counter reconnaissance by reporting hostile ground movements
especially the movement of approaching highly mobile
units and by attacking hostile attempts in force to
penetrate the screen
o Trains Trains of units composing the counterreconnaissance
screen remain with the trains of the main force
0 42 SECURITY AGAINST HOSTILE AVIATION --a General:( )
Hostile aviation presents a menace to operations of armored
force units by attacking them or observing and rendering
reports on their presence location and activity to enemy
ground forces
(2) Armored force units may frequently operate under the
protection of supporting air units or may even have attached
to it combat aviation and antiaircraft artillery for
defense against hostile aircraft (See FM 00-5 ) Regardless
of the security measures taken or furnished by the
higher command all armored force units must be alert to
the probability of hostile air attack or reconnaissance and
must provide appropriate security measures for its own protection
(3) Antiaircraft protection of a column depends initially
78
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
42
on the efficiency of the concealment in its last bivouac
Special security measures must be taken during the time of
exit from bivouac while passing through defiles at temporary
halts and during movement into assembly areas or
bivouac
(4) The principal security measures employed by armored
force units against hostile aviation include passive measures
such as night marches concealment and dispersion or distribution
into small units or groups; active measures ; and
the construction of slit trenches for all personnel except crews
of turreted vehicles
b Warning service -( ) The first requirement of antiaircraft
security is an adequate warning service Warning
of the approach of hostile aviation is provided for as follows :
(a) By air and ground reconnaissance units whose routine
missions include reports on hostile aircraft (See sec II )
(b) By detailing air scouts from all units Air scouts consist
of designated personnel in each unit whose duty observe is to for hostile aircraft and give timely warning On the
march they observe from the vehicle to which they are regularly assigned At the halt they are posted near their
units
Se) Where observation is limited because of the character
of the terrain such as in a defile a flank patrol may be posted or detailed to march along high ground parallel to the column for the specific purpose of warning of the approach
of hostile aircraft
(2) All personnel must be trained in the identification of
hostile aircraft
(3) The air alarm may be transmitted by radio improvised
visual signal prescribed whistle signal firing weapons (see
FM 7-5) or voice Any one or all the methods may be used depending upon the distance at which the warning is given from the command and whether or not the engines of vehicles are running
(4) Upon receiving the air alarm warning or signal units and personnel are governed by the following ruleÂ§ :
(a) While marching large armored force units cannot expect to keep from being observed Since the normal dis- persion of turreted vehicles renders such units an unfavorable target for air attack they continue in motion However if the column consists of open vehicles or these vehicles are
79
42
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
intermingled with turreted vehicles all will halt without
closing up and all possible small arms fire will be brought to
bear on the attacking airplanes Personnel in open vehicles
not manning antiaircraft weapons will disperse dismounted
Movement will be resumed as soon as practicable after the
hostile airplanes have passed Small groups such as patrols
or trucks moving by infiltration cease movement in the
open since they are primarily interested in escaping detection
and are not likely to be subject of an air attack When
columns halt vehicles are moved off the road whenever possible
to cover and are immediately camouflaged This is
done even though the halt is for only a few minutes
(b) In an assembly position or in a bivouac area personnel
remain motionless until the ""all clear"" signal is given
If early warning has been received they may seek cover
and remain motionless Men are trained not to look up
as faces are easily detected At night it is especially important
that these precautions be observed when hostile
aviation uses flares to illuminate an area In addition all
lights not completely concealed should be extinguished during
the period of the air alarm
c Night marches Large armored force units in the combat
zone can best escape detection from the air by marching
during the hours of darkness These night marches are
made without lights or with the use of tactical lights only
d Concealment -The presence and position of troops are
disclosed to an air observer by movement regular formation
or outline reflection of light dust smoke or newly made
tracks and installations Measures taken for concealment
aim to defeat both visual reconnaissance and photography
from the air These measures and the rules governing concealment
are covered in detail in section I Extensive artificial
camouflage rarely will be practicable (See FM 5-20 )
e Dispersion :-A command diminishes its vulnerability to
air observation and attack by adopting dispersed formations
and by distribution into small units or groups Dispersion
may be accomplished by increased width and depth of formations
; by moving in multiple columns ; by distribution in
assembly or bivouac areas into small units or groups to take
advantage of cover ; by halting at extended distances by
clearing roads and moving under nearby cover ; and by in-
80

creased speed of movement between successive terrain lines
affording cover
f Antiaircraft fdre -All units provide immediate protection
against low flying hostile aircraft by using their antiaircraft own weapons and other weapons suitable for fire against aircraft
( ) All antiaircraft weapons are alerted for antiaircraft
fire at all time Troops and personnel charged specifically
with the duty of antiaircraft firing are constantly prepared for immediate action Organic weapons provided for the purpose protect trains in movement and in service parks
(2) Fire is opened promptly upon enemy airplanes within effective range except from a concealed position where it is desirable to maintain secrecy and firing might disclose the presence of troops
g Air-borne troops -The threat from air-borne troops parachute and air-landing requires that special security measures be instituted against them Responsibility for these measures extends down through all echelons of com- mand the measures adopted within each echelon being co- ordinated in such a way as to provide a unified system over the entire danger area In general the security measures adopted are designed to gain early information ; to attack incoming enemy transports by combat aviation and antiair- craft fire ; to destroy parachute troops while in the act of landing when they are most vulnerable or immediately after ; to obstruct all possible landing fields (airdromes open fields and straight stretches of level highway) ; and to isolate and destroy all forces that land by Immediate attack before they can be resupplied and reinforced with supporting weapons See FM 00-5 and 00- 5
h Summary -In order to provide its own antiaircraft security armored force units must ;
( ) Provide timely warning of the approach of hostile airplanes
(2) Rely on dispersed formations or make such appropri- ate use of cover or concealment as conditions offer (3) Keep antiaircraft guns ready for immediate action at all times
(4) Be skillful in the antiaircraft use of its own fire weapons and open fire promptly upon enemy airplanes except

when security is to be gained through concealment rather
than fire protection
(5) Determine when security depends on fire power or on
concealment
0 43 SECURITY AGAINST HOSTILE MECHANIZED FORCES a
General -The inherent characteristics of armored units (mobility
fire power armor protection and shock action) provide
the primary means of protection against hostile mechanized
attacks Certain armored force units however do
not have this protection and additional means are frequently
necessary for their protection as well as for the security of
the command as a whole These additional security measures
are active and passive generally used in combinations
They supplement the normal security detachments provided
for the security of the command as a whole
( ) The active means available to armored force units
include employment of tank destroyer artillery chemicals
and the counterattack Combat aviation when attached
may also be employed (See FM 00-5 )
(2) The principal passive means employed include con
cealment natural and artificial obstacles demolitions and
antitank mines
b Reference -FM 00-5 covers the methods employed to
warn of mechanized threats and the use of antitank guns
artillery and chemicals
c Concealment -The rules set forth in section I governing
cover and concealment apply to all armored force units
d Natural obstacles -Terrain which is unsuitable for the
employment of hostile mechanization is also unsuitable for
the employment of friendly armored force units for offensive
action Consideration therefore must be given to the probable
employment of friendly armored force units Natural
obstacles which restrict the offensive operations of these
units are avoided However the defensive possibilities of
terrain must be studied constantly from the viewpoint of
protection and antimechanized defense in order to utilize
existing natural obstacles to the maximum extent
( ) A map study supplemented by air and ground reconnaissance
may disclose avenues of approach and natural
obstacles such as streams lakes marshes thick woods and
mountainous country which will impede or restrict enemy
82
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
43
mechanized operations During marches halts or when in
Position full use is made of those terrain features restrict the which approach of hostile mechanized vehicles When the enemy's approach is limited to a few routes 'crossing
a natural barrier protection is obtained by blocking these crossings
(2) When approaches are favorable to enemy mechanized
elements and march columns are exposed chief reliance must be placed on active means of providing security
(3) Tank destroyer and artillery units when employed
on antimechanized missions take advantage of local natural obstacles including buildings walls and stump covered or rocky areas
e Artificial obstacles -Artificial obstacles such as barri- cades demolitions and antitank mines normally are em- ployed by armored force units only to block crossings defiles and other routes of approach of hostile mechanized vehicles ; to provide additional security of bivouac areas ; and for local defense of tank destroyer and artillery units and weapons on antimechanized missions
( ) Engineers with armored force units are charged with the placing and construction of major artificial obstacles (For details see FM 5-30 ) When artificial obstacles are em- ployed their location must be coordinated with natural obstacles and with the fire of antitank and other weapons The main effort in the construction of artificial obstacles is made on those parts of the front possessing natural ob- stacles which are susceptible of improvement The bulk of the antitank guns are placed to cover the avenues favorable for tank action A barrier or obstacle loses much of its defensive value unless covered by fire of supporting troops Removal of obstacles can be impeded by contamination with
persistent chemical agents In general obstacles demoli- tions mines and persistent gas contaminations are located where the enemy will come upon them suddenly and be unable to avoid them
(2) Demolitions and mines are useful for quickly blocking defiles and principal avenues of approach They constitute a means for canalizing a hostile mechanized attack Mines have the advantage over demolitions in that mines may pro- duce casualities both of personnel and vehicles The location of mines must be coordinated with natural and artificial
83
43-44
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
obstacles and with the fire of antitank guns and other
weapons
(3) Artificial obstacles demolitions antitank mines and
contaminated areas may restrict the movement of troops
which they are designed to protect A record must be made
of the location and extent of such measures when used so
that the necessary precautions may be prescribed for the
safety of friendly troops
(4) The construction of road blocks is covered in FM 5-30
(a) Employment-A road block is a barrier to block or limit
the movement of hostile vehicles along a road They are
used to protect the flanks of a marching column or an
encircling force ; to delay an enemy to give time and space
for deployment for combat or time to organize the defense ;
and as counterreconnaissance measures
(b) Location -Road blocks are located in defiles where
they cannot be readily avoided To be most effective a road
block should be located so that the enemy will come upon
it suddenly A position immediately around a bend where
vegetation shields it from view of approaching hostile elements
is preferable Covered or concealed positions from which
effective machine gun or antitank gun fire can cover the
obstacle are desirable
(c) Construction -Road blocks may be constructed by
engineers when available However all units must be trained
in the methods of constructing hasty obstacles and in their
removal
(d) Defense -Road blocks must be defended by fire
Strength of the defense depends upon the means available
and extent of delay desired The defense may vary from
two riflemen to several riflemen machine guns and selfpropelled
guns Guns are so placed that their fire will prevent
hostile troops from removing the obstacle or passing
around it Tank destroyer elements may be used The employment
of tanks to defend road blocks is unusual When so
used they should operate by section taking mutually supporting
positions to increase protection against stalking and
to permit rapid withdrawal
44 SECURITY AGAINST CHEMICALS -Security against chemicals
is conducted in accordance with the fundamentals prescribed
in FM 00-5 and procedure outlined in FM 2 -40
84
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
45-46
â 45 SUMMARY --a All armored force units must provide
themselves with the necessary security to protect themselves
at all times against surprise observation and interference by
hostile air and ground forces
b All security measures include an adequate warning service
to prevent surprise
c Security detachments between the enemy and the main
body are detailed to prevent observation by hostile ground
forces
d Protection of the main body against interference is
obtained by making security detachments sufficiently strong
to either defeat the enemy or to hold the enemy until the
main body gains time for deployment to meet the threat
e Reconnaissance is an essential element of security
f Terrain and the road net are important factors in the
security of a command
g A command's readiness for action is facilitated by the
distribution of units in the main body and prior plans to
meet enemy situations
h Special measures must be taken for protection against
hostile aviation and mechanized units and enemy chemical
attacks
i The use of armored troops on security missions except
for theii own security when others 'are available for this
duty is justified only under conditions of extreme emergency
It will be remembered that armored units are first last and
always offensive troops
SECTION IV
OFFENSIVE COMBAT
â 46 GENERAL --a Purpose Offensive combat has object for its the attainment of an objective by means of the attack The organization and equipment of armored force units are designed primarily for offensive combat Units must be im- bued with the spirit of the offensive and must be always on the alert to seize the opportunity for offensive action The at- tack of armored force units should be characterized by bold- ness and speed in striking sudden blows in the most favorable direction
b Scope -Armored force units are employed in accord- ance with the principles of large numbers surprise and ma- neuver (See FM 00-5 )
85
46
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
( ) Large numbers -They are employed in large numbers
in decisive areas which afford suitable terrain and sufficient
space to utilize fully their mobility and shock action Protection
against hostile air attack and antitank weapons is
a prerequisite of successful employment
(2) Surprise -Surprise is obtained by rapid maneuver
secrecy and deception By prompt delivery of the initial
blow the commander places his adversary at a disadvantage
and forces him on the defensive or prevents him from organizing
his defenses A rapid bold attack by a small force
may often accomplish more than a slower carefully coordinated
attack by a larger force By such an attack initiative
is taken from the enemy and his plans for attack or defense
disrupted
(3) Maneuver -The maneuver of units rapidly to project
shock action and protected fire power into the vital part of
hostile rear areas from an unexpected direction must be
sought in all attacks
c Use of terrain -Full advantage must be taken of terrain
favorable for movement concealment and use as observation
points Terrain suitable for operations should provide :
concealed apass=emblyppositiorns (areoas) coaveredcrouteshof
areas for attack sufficiently free of obstacles to permit
movement to objectives at speed and suitable positions and
observation for supporting artillery and other ground weapons
during the attack (See par 26 )
d Initiative -Initiative of subordinates plays a great part
in success in any action Commanders will often be confronted
especially when the situation is obscure with the
problem of making immediate decision and initiating prompt
action Time may but usually will not permit detailed reconnaissance
Mission type orders may be given and leaders
of small units must be relied upon to make a prompt
estimate of the situation arrive quickly at a decision and
promptly and energetically carry out that decision Decisions
made must be in conformity with the general missions
and intentions of the commander hence it is essential
that all commanders be informed of such missions and intentions
Calm and clear yet rapid thinking must be combined
with a high degree of initiative Snap judgment must
be avoided
e Fire and movement -( ) The principal means of attack
86
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
46
for armored force units is a combination of fire and movement to reduce enemy opposition By fire and movement is meant the advance by certain elements or units (maneuvering ele- ment) protected by the fire of other elements or units (base of fire) The object of this form of attack is to advance elements
or units to positions from which stationary fire will
annihilate enemy opposition or to a point where a swift
assault over a short distance strongly supported by fire can be launched to overrun the enemy position
(a) This method of attack is applicable in the largest armored force unit and down to and including the section
For example the regiment attacks by fire and movement
when the armored (tank) battalions advance under the cover of the base of fire established by its machine gun and mortar units and by supporting artillery
(b) Fire and movement is generally employed by the com- ponents of the maneuvering force when enemy fire is en- countered For example a platoon in the maneuvering force
when held up by fire furnishes its own base of fire consist- ing of one of its sections This section preferably from a partially deflladed position fires while the other section maneuvers to a forward position from which it in turn estab- lishes a temporary base of fire to cover the advance of the former
(c) Fire and movement is also employed in displacing for- ward by the force constituting the base of fire For exam- ple the elements of the 'self-propelled gun platoon and mortar platoon displace forward to a new position by echelons each echelon being protected in its advance by the fire from the elements remaining in position
(2) The elements or units constituting the base of fire
deliver fire from either vehicular or ground mounted weap- ons depending upon the cover and the field of fire availa- ble The vehicles of the maneuvering force advance by cov- ered routes where practicable ; weapons being fired from the vehicle when the enemy position is in view Where the terrain permits vehicles move into a partially defiladed position fire a small burst maneuver to a new position and repeat The 37-mm and 75-mm guns are normally fired when the' tank is halted Where the terrain is relatively flat and smooth a large burst of fire may be delivered while the vehicle is moving Even under the most favorable
87
46
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
terrain conditions fire will be more effective if the vehicle is
halted a few seconds while a small burst is fired and then
moves on Firing from moving vehicles should only be attempted
where a swift assault over open terrain for a short
distance (not over 200 yards) is desired ; casualties can only
be held down when this assault is given the maximum fire
support of supporting weapons
Tactical forms of attack -The tactical forms of attack
are covered in detail in FM 00-5 The mobility of armored
force units permits great latitude in the choice of direction
and method of attack Against forces of similar characteristics
and against strongly organized positions the turning
movement is the preferred form Against groups or
positions highly vulnerable to armored attack the attack
may be an envelopment of one or both hostile flanks preferably
the latter When the mission time terrain and
other factors do not favor an envelopment an attack against
the hostile front may be by a penetration A prompt direct
attack may be made to take full advantage of surprise or
of a temporarily favorable situation
g Tactical groupings -In attack 9the combat command
groups generally are disposed into four parts : a reconnaissance
force (consisting of organic reconnaissance units and attack
units) a striking force (the striking echelon consisting of
tanks with engineers attached) a supporting force (consisting
of the support echelon l e the infantry artillery and
tank destroyer units) and a reserve Whether the striking
force makes the initial attack or main attack will depend on
the terrain and the extent and dispositions of the hostile
antitank defenses
( ) Striking force -When terrain is favorable for tank
operation and hostile antitank defenses are not strong the
striking echelon supported by available combat aviation
makes the initial attack This attack is usually by envelopment
the supporting echelon being used as a holding force
or base of fire or a portion of the tank units may be used
for such holding or secondary attack The striking echelon
will make the initial attack in a penetration only when hostile
defenses are very weak or when given overwhelming air and
artillery support Engineers are usually attached to the
striking echelon Infantry may be attached
(2) Support force -When the striking force makes the
88
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
46
initial attack the support echelon follows to seize and hold
objectives taken by the striking echelon When terrain is unfavorable
for tank operation or antitank defenses are the strong support echelon supported by medium tank units may
lead the attack to secure ground from which the striking
echelon may attack The support echelon usually leads the attack in a penetration The support echelon may be used to make an attack initially to serve as a base of fire for the
striking force in an envelopment This attack serves to fix
the enemy and may attract his reserves In this manner it assists the advance of the enveloping or striking force (3) Reserve -A part of the command the reserve is held
out of the combat initially for employment by the commander
of the whole force in furtherance of his plan of attack or for
use according to the development of the action The reserve
is composed chiefly of tank units Its strength usually varies
from one-third to a small fraction of the command A maximum
is held out against an enemy composed of mechanized
troops or strong in antitank weapons Its employment will
vary with existing conditions and opportunities As soon as the reserve is committed a new reserve must be constituted
without delay
(a) The commander of the reserve must be in close communication
with the commander of the whole force
(b) In emergencies he must not hesitate to act without
waiting for orders keeping in mind the mission and general
plan of the commander He must maintain personal reconnaissance
and keep close contact with the attacking troops
He should anticipate possible uses of the reserve and prepare
tentative plans therefor
(c) The commanding officer of the reserve must conduct

or movement
(d) The reserve is located in a position from which it can best support the main effort and protect the flanks To support an envelopment the reserve is located towards the flank enveloped generally in rear of the main attack
(e) When the main attack force reaches the enemy or attains its objectives the reserve must be ready to take
advantage of the situation to give an added impetus to the
attack at a critical moment to clinch the victory or to resist

attack force
h Employment of tanks ( ) General-In the attack the
mobility fire power and shock action of tanks are exploited
to the maximum Tank attacks will be costly or will result
in failure to reach their objective unless employed in decisive
numbers
(a) The width and depth of the formation depe~ds upon
the situation and terrain Terrain may limit the breadth of
the formation and force a unit to attack on a narrow front
When the situation is obscure or great power is needed to
overcome hostile resistance a deep formation is used This
formation gives the maximum control and flexibility When
a limited objective attack is to be made such as in withdrawal
a broad formation may be used This formation is difficult
to control Echelon formation is suitable for flank protection
units being echeloned toward the flank to be protected
(b) Tank units are arranged in the attack formation in
accordance with the plan of attack They advance to their
objectives by a combination of fire and movement Within
the platoons the intervals and distances between tanks is
not to be less than 50 yards when supporting other ground
troops ; otherwise not less than 75 yards The distance between
successive waves must not be less than 50 yards
(2) Light tanks -The primary mission of the light tank
units is to close with the enemy and to disrupt the hostile
organization in vital rear areas by fast bold action This
is accomplished by destroying hostile automatic weapons and
personnel ; disrupting communications ; and overrunning
command posts artillery positions reserves and other installations
essential to the enemy

force This method insures the bestcoordination of the attack and should be usedwhenever existing conditions render it feasible2 A signal visual or otherwise This method maybe necessary when conditions of terrain and theenemy situation are so vague or uncertain as torender the prescribing of a definite hour impracticable When employed care should be taken toinsure that the signal prescribed can be seen andunderstood3 Making the time of attack of one element dependentupon the time or progress of attack of the otherThis presupposes that the terrain over which theattacks take place is clearly visible to one or bothelements or that close liaison existsSuch amethod of time coordination may prescribe thatone element attack in conjunction with the other ;when the attack of one element has been launchedthe attack of the other is made at the same timeor at such time thereafter as to bring the fullweight of both attacks on the enemy4 The secondary or main attack force being directed toattack as soon as in position Frequently this maybe the only feasible method because of difficultiesof terrain uncertainty or rapidly changing conditions in the enemy situation(c) When the command attacks by a double envelopmentany one or combination of the foregoing methods may beemployed that are applicableq Orders ( ) Attack orders for armored force units usually are issued orally They are issued to the assembled staffand available unit commanders prior to the separation ofthe various elements for the attack When practicable orders are issued at a point from which the objective can beseen To those not present orders may be delivered asappropriate orally by staff officer messengers by radio or(written) by motorcycle messengers Fragmentary ordersare frequently used Orders are issued sufficiently far in advance to permit subordinates as much time as possible forreconnaissance for the preparation of plans and issuance oftheir own orders For the form and details of the attackorder see FM 0 -5(a) Orders will designate or prescribe as may be necessary-intermediate assembly positions line of departuretime of attack zone of action direction of attack objectiveor objectives rallying

coveredby orders Leaders must be enterprising and always ready toseize opportunities for the employment of their commands infurtherance of the plan of the higher commanderr Control -( ) The chief requirements of control duringthe attack are simplicity of plans and formations rigid adherence to the procedure of follow the leader reliable radioand visual communication and prearranged rallying pointsor alternate rallying points(2) Control by a commander of an armored force unit during attack is difficult He exercises such control as is p ossibleb y utilizing all practicable means of communication andliaison and by making full use of his staff The commanderof the whole force is well forward until his troops are committed to action He may remain with the force whosemission is of decisive importance to the action or may go to aposition from which he can observe the action of both thesecondary and maneuvering forces He should at all timesbe in close communication with his command post and hisreserve Control is always regained at rallying or alternaterallying points(3) Since mobility of all elements may result in considerable dispersion the greatest possible latitude is given subordinates to accomplish their missions in their own mannerin conformity with the general plan rather than on specificinstructions During the approach march formations are asflexible as conditions of the terrain permit Each tank commander selects his route and rate of march to conform tothe general formation and takes full advantage of covers Formations -Formations of units in the

of small units or when reconnaissance is ineffective Again it may occur when each opponent is cognizant of the other but both decide to attackwithout delay to retain or gain some tactical advantage or togain a decisive terrain feature or because of a knowledge ofsuperiority over the other Except where armored units areemployed to rupture a position collision with hostile forceswill usually be in the nature of a meeting engagementb Plans ( ) Preliminary planning Anticipatory planning is essential to success in a meeting engagement Planning starts with receipt of warning orders for the movementAll available data on the route or routes of march and terrainof the zone of advance is obtained and information concerning it disseminated to commanders The best available mapsare procured and distributed Aerial photographic reconnaissance is used to supplement the maps Reconnaissancestrips and individual photographs are taken of critical pointsand areas By study of these data and maps the commanderplans his march and disposes his subordinate units in variouscolumns so as best to develop for combat He determines thecritical points in the zone of advance and makes plans foraction against the enemy at those points He determinespoints or areas where the enemy may be taken by surprise orat a disadvantage and plans to force combat in such areas ifopportunity arises Plans are made flexible and troops aredisposed for control and to facilitate rapid entry into battleCommanders of the main subdivisions of the command areinformed of these plans and given orders missions or tasksfor carrying them out08TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE48(2) Dispositions Armored units advance usually in multiple columns covered by advance flank and rear guards asnecessary and by reconnaissance elements well to

area
(3) Reconnaissance -Reconnaissance for positions and routes thereto is continuous during the advance Informa- tion gained is immediately transmitted to the battalion head- quarters or the company concerned Battalions and com- pany reconnaissance personnel supplements the reconnais- sance of units to which the battalion or its companies are attached Close cooperation must be maintained with obser- vation aviation
(4) Liaison -The battalion sends a liaison officer to the unit to which it is attached and each company sends liaison personnel to the unit to which it is attached Close liaison must be maintained in order that the tank destroyer units may act promptly

may be used to guard an exposed flank In this case they
are usually attached to or act as flank guard When the
armored units go into assembly areas tank destroyers immediately
place guns in position to cover likely avenues of approach
for attacking armored units A portion of the battalion
or company is held in mobile reserve ready to reinforce
any threatened point
(6) During combat -Tank destroyer units may advance
behind the second echelon of attack usually the second armored
battalion in depth They are prepared to repel counterattacks
from the flanks and rear The greater part of the
unit should if terrain is suitable be near the exposed flank
(7) During reorganization -As the attack progresses the
tank units in rear will pass through the destroyer units to
enter combat After the objective is reached the tank destroyer
units move rapidly forward and cover the rallying
point to protect the reorganization
(8) In defense In defense the tank destroyer battalion
is usually kept intact in mobile reserve In such position that
it may move promptly to any threatened point to repel a
counterattack Tank destroyer units are not ordinarily attached
to lower units and emplaced as stationary antitank
guns in defense Their mobility is preserved
(9) Retrograde movements -In retrograde movements
tank destroyer units are usually attached to the rear guard
They are held mobile ready to repel enemy armored units
( 0) River crossings -In river crossings tank destroyer
units should cross the river immediately after the infantry in
order to repel hostile armored counterattacks
( ) The employment of the tank destroyer company is
covered in chapter 7
j Artillery -( ) Role -The role of the armored artillery
is to support the armored division and its elements in the
conduct of highly mobile ground warfare primarily offensive
in character
(2) Sources of fire missions-The sources of artillery fire
missions are :
(a) Artillery forward observers (with advance elements of
division) -The armored vehicle serves as an armored observation
post for these observers Radio is the means of
communication
(b) Air observation -Air observers report directly to the

particular artillery echelon with which they are functioning
Prearrangement of plans and definite assignment of zones of
responsibility for observation and fire are essential
(c) Artillery liaison officers -Artillery liaison officers accompany
the armored unit commanders Flexibility in plans
and fire support by the artillery are thus facilitated
(3) On the march -The armored division usually advances
in multiple columns When contact is imminent for any column
its advance guard moves on a broad front Artillery
usually supports this type of action by immediate occupation
of a position Continuous support is effected by displacement
by echelon The artillery must be prepared to place fire on
the principal routes leading toward the marching columns
from the front and flanks If no special use for the battery is
contemplated it Is left under artillery control with limitations
placed on its employment and displacement
(4) In assembly areas and bivouac -When armored are forces in assembly areas or bivouac artillery is posted to cover
all approaches to the area Positions are selected from which
it may bring long range interdiction fire on principal routes
of approach for hostile forces It performs counterbattery
missions if within -range of hostile artillery It supplements
the antitank defense of the area
(5) Attack of deliberately prepared hostile position - (a) Fires preceding attack-The division artillery officer is responsible for the coordination of all fire by the artillery
of the division (organic and reinforcing) A short preparation
may precede the attack
(b) Fires in support of the attack -Fires in support of the
attack are planned and executed as follows :
Limited objective -Same as (5) (a)
2 Unlimited objective-The mobility of the armored
division practically precludes complete coordination
of artillery fire in support of the attack Normally
decentralization is effected by attachment of
elements of the artillery to the armored echelons
(c) Normal artillery fires in support of the attack -These
fires include :

gives direct support Artillery of the encircling force takes
positions from which it may fire on retreating hostile forces
It supports the attack of tank units It assists in repelling
counterattacks made against the encircling force
k Mortar units -Mortar fire is coordinated with the artillery
fire to avoid duplication of effort Mortars place smoke
screens at the shorter ranges while the artillery fires smoke
at the longer ranges Infantry mortar units are employed
with the infantry elements Mortar platoons of armored
battalions operate with these units normally under centralized
control In some situations a section of the mortar platoon
may be attached to a subordinate unit For further details
on the employment of mortars of armored force units see
chapter 5
Aviation -( ) Operation of the armored force is facilitated
by control of the air Such control permits free movement
of units in the approach and makes possible the support
of an attack by bombardment aviation Lack of control
of the air although not prohibiting movement makes
operations much more difficult Pursuit aviation is employed
to deny the use of the air to hostile observation and
bombardment aviation
(2) Combat 'aviation supports armored force units by attacks
on hostile supply and command installations reserves
artillery antitank weapons and other resistance holding up
an attack In the advance combat aviation in close support
is used to attack and delay hostile columns In the attack
it supplements the fire of artillery against critical targets ;
attacks targets beyond the range of artillery ; gives close
support to attacking units that have advanced beyond range
of their supporting artillery ; and attacks hostile counterattacking
forces In pursuit it gives close support to pursuing
forces by attack on hostile resistances holding up the movement
; by attacking and delaying withdrawing hostile forces ;
and by destruction of bridges on routes of withdrawal In
defense it attacks hostile attacking forces reserves command
and supply installations
(3) Observation aviation performs battle reconnaissance as
previously discussed in this chapter It is also employed
during a crisis in combat to maintain liaison and coordination
between tanks artillery and combat aviation
m Infantry element -( ) Action of the armored infantry

46 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
in the attack varies Part or all of it may be employed in the
secondary attack A part of it may be attached to the
maneuvering element or be held in reserve It remains mobile
as long as the situation permits and then may be employed as
follows :
(a) To clarify or develop a situation such as attacking to
drive in hostile covering forces or attacking a hostile antitank
zone
(b) To seize terrain from which to launch a tank attack
(c) To make holding attacks while tank units envelop
(d) To follow closely the main attack to overcome the remaining
hostile resistance occupy and hold ground gained
(e) To cover the flanks against a hostile threat
(f) To constitute a new reserve
(g) To protect tank units during their reorganization after
the attack
(h) To protect tank units at night in movement or in
bivouac
(2) The fire of infantry supporting weapons is coordinated
with that of the artillery The fire of these weapons supplements
the artillery direct support fire chiefly by engaging
targets in the immediate foreground
n Engineer units -Engineer units may be employed with
the main or secondary attack forces to facilitate their movement
in the attack Engineer missions will include : removing
or assisting In the passage of obstacles and mine fields ; providing
means for crossing streams ; and protection of flanks
by means of obstacles demolitions and mines Engineer
troops engage in combat when necessary for the accomplishment
of their assigned work (For details see FM 5-30 )
o Use of chemicals -Because of the difficulty of establishing
and maintaining effective chemical concentrations in
mobile operations use of chemical agents other than smoke
by armored force units in the attack is limited The employment
of smoke must be limited carefully in respect to
both time and space and must be coordinated carefully with
other supporting fires and with the action of tanks and sup
porting aviation Under favorable conditions of wind and
weather smoke is used to blind hostile observation posts
antitank guns and infantry supporting weapons to conceal
the approach of the attacking elements and to protect the
96
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
46
flanks of the attack It is especially useful periods during short when troops must traverse exposed ground ' ( ) Smoke may be projected from artillery or mortar shell ; from aircraft or dischargers attached to tanks Smoke placed by mortars frequently will be more effective than artillery fire in neutralizing observation and hostile antitank gun fire within a particular area
(2) Partial loss of control and disorganization may result from tanks passing through smoke It must not be placed on tank objectives or on areas where tanks will be required to pass in the assault unless the wind conditions are such that it will be dissipated before the arrival of the tanks
p Coordination -( ) General-The commander is re- sponsible for coordination of all elements of his command Attacks launched directly from march columns without halt- ing or with a short halt may result In an uncoordinated attack loss of control and a sacrifice of some of the capabil- ities of artillery tanks and other supporting weapons Such attacks will usually be launched in a meeting engagement or against a retreating enemy They may be launched against
an inferior enemy against an enemy not fully organized for defense or against an enemy whose morale is low Ordi- narily an attack in a moving situation may be organized and
coordinated In assembly or intermediate positions
(2) During the attack the action of the light and medium
tank units must be coordinated with each other and with the action of the infantry and other supporting units The
fire of all supporting weapons must be coordinated wherever
practicable with the scheme of maneuver and plan of tank employment In all cases the maximum coordination per- mitted by the situation and time element is sought The measures to insure coordination are prescribed in the attack
order
(3) Line o/ departure -See FM 00-5 and appendix I (4) Intermediate position If the line of departure is at a considerable distance from the assembly position an inter- mediate position may be designated for coordinating the advance of all elements
(5) Attack position -An attack position on or immedi- ately in rear of the line of departure may be designated for the coordination of armored force units with other ground forces they are supporting
97
46
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(6) Rallying and alternate rallying points -Rallying and
alternate rallying points are designated where the unit
assembles after combat for the purpose of reorganization
Rallying and alternate points are announced for each objective
The rallying point is usually just in rear of the objective
The alternate rallying point is farther to the rear and
may be the attack or intermediate position In the exploitation
of a break-through a series of rallying points may be
designated along the axis of advance These are designated
before the movement starts Any change in direction of advance
will require the designation of new rallying points
(7) Obfectives -Each subordinate tank unit in the attack
chould be assigned a principal objective Suitable objectives
are :
(a) Hostile elements or installations the destruction of
which will disrupt most effectively the enemy operation
(b) Enemy reserves
(c) A decisive terrain feature
(8) Time of attack -The earlier an attack can be launched
after gaining contact with the enemy the less preparation
the enemy can make to meet it and the greater the possibility
of surprise Ordinarily the main attack by tank units
should not be started unless there is sufficient daylight remaining
to permit such units to reach their objective by
nightfall The time of the attack will depend chiefly upon
the enemy situation terrain and the time required to organize
and prepare for the attack
(a) The time of attack may be indicated by prescribing
a definite hour or by prescribing that the unit will attack
upon order (radio visual signal or other means) of the
commander ; or on reaching a certain line or terrain feature
(b) When the command attacks by an envelopment the
time of attack may be indicated by:
Prescribing a definite hour for each part of the
attacking force This method insures the best
coordination of the attack and should be used
whenever existing conditions render it feasible
2 A signal visual or otherwise This method may
be necessary when conditions of terrain and the
enemy situation are so vague or uncertain as to
render the prescribing of a definite hour impracticable
When employed care should be taken to
98
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
46
insure that the signal prescribed can be seen and
understood
3 Making the time of attack of one element dependent
upon the time or progress of attack of the other
This presupposes that the terrain over which the
attacks take place is clearly visible to one or both
elements or that close liaison exists Such a
method of time coordination may prescribe that
one element attack in conjunction with the other ;
when the attack of one element has been launched
the attack of the other is made at the same time
or at such time thereafter as to bring the full
weight of both attacks on the enemy
4 The secondary or main attack force being directed to
attack as soon as in position Frequently this may
be the only feasible method because of difficulties
of terrain uncertainty or rapidly changing conditions
in the enemy situation
(c) When the command attacks by a double envelopment
any one or combination of the foregoing methods may be
employed that are applicable
q Orders ( ) Attack orders for armored force units usually
are issued orally They are issued to the assembled staff
and available unit commanders prior to the separation of
the various elements for the attack When practicable orders
are issued at a point from which the objective can be
seen To those not present orders may be delivered as
appropriate orally by staff officer messengers by radio or
(written) by motorcycle messengers Fragmentary orders
are frequently used Orders are issued sufficiently far in advance
to permit subordinates as much time as possible for
reconnaissance for the preparation of plans and issuance of
their own orders For the form and details of the attack
order see FM 0 -5
(a) Orders will designate or prescribe as may be necessary-
intermediate assembly positions line of departure
time of attack zone of action direction of attack objective
or objectives rallying and alternate rallying points and the
limit of pursuit
(b) Orders to supporting units will contain definite instructions
covering the particular support the unit Is to render
As appropriate these orders whl cover positions targets time

ARMORED FORCE FIELD M NUAL
of opening fire any limitations of fire forward displacement
and subsequent action
(2) When conditions require decentralization of command
is encouraged The initiative of subordinates is relied upon
The commander issues mission type orders to those tactical'
groupings in which command is decentralized and attaches
the means necessary to accomplish their tasks
(3) In armored force units it is particularly necessary that
smaller units be familiar with higher plans in order that they
may act promptly and correctly in any situation not covered
by orders Leaders must be enterprising and always ready to
seize opportunities for the employment of their commands in
furtherance of the plan of the higher commander
r Control -( ) The chief requirements of control during
the attack are simplicity of plans and formations rigid adherence
to the procedure of follow the leader reliable radio
and visual communication and prearranged rallying points
or alternate rallying points
(2) Control by a commander of an armored force unit during
attack is difficult He exercises such control as is p ossible
b y utilizing all practicable means of communication and
liaison and by making full use of his staff The commander
of the whole force is well forward until his troops are committed
to action He may remain with the force whose
mission is of decisive importance to the action or may go to a
position from which he can observe the action of both the
secondary and maneuvering forces He should at all times
be in close communication with his command post and his
reserve Control is always regained at rallying or alternate
rallying points
(3) Since mobility of all elements may result in considerable
dispersion the greatest possible latitude is given subordinates
to accomplish their missions in their own manner
in conformity with the general plan rather than on specific
instructions During the approach march formations are as
flexible as conditions of the terrain permit Each tank commander
selects his route and rate of march to conform to
the general formation and takes full advantage of cover
s Formations -Formations of units in the attack should
be simple and flexible in order that units may retain their
ability to maneuver Dispositions should permit control

power in the shortest time with least exposure to hostile fire
t Frontage and depth -The depth and frontage of the
initial combat formations depend primarily upon known
hostile composition and dispositions the terrain and distance
to the objective
( ) The main attack is delivered on the minimum frontage
necessary to overcome resistance to its advance consistent
with the number of tank units employed It is launched in
sufficient depth to insure sustained and successive striking
power
(2) Secondary attacks are characterized by lack of depth
limited objectives and wide zones of action The frontage
of any unit in the secondary attack is based in general upon
its principal weapon strength It varies with the mission or
missions and combat power of the unit the terrain the
amount of fire support available and the probable hostile
resistance that will be encountered
47 CONDUCT OF OFFENSE-a Offensive action -Offensive
situations that armored force units will participate in are
covered under subsequent paragraphs They may be classed
generally as :
( ) Meeting-engagements
(2) Attacks against enemy positions
(3) Exploitation of a success
(4) Pursuit
(5) Special operations
b Development for combat( ) In anticipation of offensive
combat an armored force unit is disposed with the reconnaissance
elements in contact or seeking contact with the
enemy the advance guard furnishing security en route the
combat elements in the main body in the order facilitating
their employment the light maintenance elements close up
in rear and the supply and administrative elements moving
well to 'the rear
(2) Development for offensive combat may be from the
march column direct with the minimum amount of coordination
or if the approach is made at night it will be made
from assembly positions (areas) Should the commander
decide that rapidity of action is essential to retain a tactical
advantage he may dispense with assembly positions decentralize
operations to combat units and issue orders to those

units to develop and attack Normally coordinated attacks
are organized and launched from assembly positions (See
fig 24 )
c Assembly positions (see fig 24) Under conditions
where contact is imminent especially at night and march
formations are no longer safe to continue the units go into
previously reconnoitered assembly positions Assignment of
units to assembly positions is based chiefly upon the cover
and concealment available ; the disposition of units upon their
probable employment ; and to facilitate their initial movement
from the assembly positions Movement into positions
is under protection of the advance guard Guides are provided
to lead units into their assembly positions Depending
upon the available cover positions may be widely separated
They should not be within the range of hostile light artillery
fire Movement into assembly positions is often made under
the cover of darkness Daylight positions will have to be
changed after dark if the command is to bivouac Subordinate
commanders assign assembly positions to the component
units of their command in accordance with the foregoing
principles
( ) While units are moving into their assembly positions
the commander prepares his orders and completes arrangements
for the execution of his scheme of maneuver including :
instructions for further reconnaissance ; arrangements for
coordinating the action of troops in the attack echelon with
that of the artillery combat aviation and other supporting
elements; assignment of artillery units to direct and general
support ; attachments to attacking troops ; establishment of
communications ; and any other necessary measures Before
he decides on his scheme of maneuver for an attack the
commander whenever practicable makes a personal â¢r econnaissance
If possible he should be accompanied by his immediate
subordinate commanders
(2) As each unit arrives in its assembly position elements
take up dispersed formations suitable to the available cover
and concealment and to facilitate movement in more than
one direction out of the position Measures are taken immediately
for security against both air and ground forces
Roads are cleared and exits reconnoitered Communication
is esablished without delay between command posts and
liaison with the next higher unit is maintained Radio com-

(3) Maintenance and supply echelons are brought up to their unit assembly positions Vehicles are refueled last minute inspections are made and necessary maintenance is
performed until the last moment Extra ammunition re- quired is issued Kitchen trucks may be brought up and
personnel fed while in the assembly position
(4) Commanders of troops in the attack echelon and commanders
of units designated to support them coordinate the action of their units Coordination of the plans for maneu- ver and plans of the fire of subordinate units is completed and attack orders are issued promptly
d Phases of attack -Normally the attack passes through several stages These stages are the approach march de- ployment for attack fire fight assault reorganization and pursuit Some of these phases may be omitted For exam- ple in a sudden meeting engagement units may have to deploy for the attack direct from the march formation and be launched in an assault without going through an approach march or engaging in a fire fight There must be a reorgani- zation of attacking units afterwards An attack may be followed by a pursuit
e Approach march -( ) Security -In the approach to the attack a force protects its front by the use of a covering de- tachment Flanks and rear are protected by the utilization of terrain the use of combat patrols tank destroyer weapons
supports and reserves Any element of the command oper- ating at such distance that the security provided by the higher commander is not sufficient must provide its own security groups All subordinate units are responsible for the local protection of their flanks (For details on security see sec III )
(2) Formations -The main body of a combat force moves out from the assembly position in approach march forma- tions at the prescribed distance in rear of the covering de- tachments which move by bounds The enemy situation and terrain determine the fgrmation It should be extended both laterally and in depth in anticipation of the attack and to afford protection of personnel and vehicles from hostile long range fire The formation should be such as to take
03
47
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
advantage of covered routes Smaller units maneuver in
their approach to take as much advantage of cover as the
rate of advance permits Formations may and should be
changed to meet terrain conditions (See FM 7-5 )
(3) Intermediate positions -The approach march continues
to the line of departure except where halts of brief
duration are made at predesignated intermediate positions
for the purpose of coordination or pending further reconnaissance
Units remain disposed insofar as practicable in the
same relative position as in the approach march with vehicles
dispersed under cover
f Deployment for attack -As soon as resistance is encountered
by covering detachments the leading waves take up
attack formations before coming under effective fire Deployment
for the attack generally takes place as the line of
departure is crossed If the objective is at a distance from

thenumber of hostile dead ; by the diminution of hostile artilleryfire ; by the relaxation or cessation of hostile countermeasures ;and from reports that the enemy is withdrawingb Preparation for pursuit-When it is recognized that theenemy is withdrawing the commander should immediately increase pressure on the enemy to maintain continuity of theattack He regroups his reserves and makes plans for encircling and completing the destruction of the enemy Heorganizes his command into a direct pressure and an encirdling forceA reorganization line usually a line of rallying points is set from which to launch the pursuitc Object of pursuit -The object of the pursuit is theannihilation of the hostile forces Pursuit is pushed to theutmost endurance of men and vehicles No opportunity mustbe

"rture approach march formations may be
continued by all or part of the attack echelon until subjected
to hostile fire
( ) Usually if attack formations are not taken as the line
of departure is crossed a partial deployment in anticipation
of the attack formation is made This is done to permit the
continued advance of the rear elements when the leading
waves assume the attack formation For example a company
in line of platoons may change to a wedge formation
(platoons in column)
(2) Within attacking platoons maximum extended intervals
and distances consistent with control are taken to
afford protection to personnel and vehicles and permit them
to reach their objective with minimum casualties Vehicles
are disposed so that they will not interfere with the fire or
maneuver of adjacent vehicles Suitable attack formations
of platoons or companies are the squads wedge or squads
echelon formations (See FM 7-5 )
(3) Security during the attack is provided by reconnaissance
elements and combat patrols Liaison is maintained
by connecting groups (See sec III )
(4) For details concerning the conduct of the attack see
chapters 5 7 2 and 3

primary mission of the units in the secondary attack force
(support echelon) Maneuvering units engage the enemy
during their advance by fire and movement
h Assault -The assault is the final combined effort of the all combat units to overcome enemy resistance
( ) Generally the tank units supported by the maximum
fire of supporting elements launch their assault by a short
swift concerted attack to overrun the enemy It is made
upon the signal of the leader of each wave after the units
have deployed and advanced to a point from which the objective
is readily discernible and the hostile position and
direction of attack is fixed Normally the assault is launched
from 200 to 400 yards from the objective Tanks are driven
at speed delivering a maximum volume of fire from their
weapons as they close with the enemy and overrun the hostile
position Units of the secondary attack force whose fire is
masked are displaced forward
(2) Some medium tank units may be used in turret defiladed
positions to support the assault by fire These positions
should be on the flank of the assaulting wave so that
fire of the medium tanks may be maintained until the last
practicable moment
(3) AfterÂ°overruning their objectives tank units are reorganized
as subsequently described
i Consolidation of positions -Consolidation of positions is
accomplished by infantry and tank destroyer units who hold the captured objective and cover the reorganization of the tank elements Antitank weapons artillery machine guns
and mortars are disposed in mutually supporting positions
to protect the consolidation and reorganization The coordination
of the forward displacement of all units is the
function of the force commander
j Reorganization -( ) After an attack whether successful
or not the commander must reorganize his command
preparatory to further operations This is accomplished by
units reorganizing at rallying points or at alternate rallying
points under the protection of other combat units If pursuit
or another mission has been ordered previously it proceeds
after the reorganization
(a) Depending upon the time available at these points the
tank unit commander makes any necessary reorganization of his unit ; directs the tank crews assisted by the mechanical
05
47
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
crews to make needed repairs ; supervises the repair and redistribution
of weapons where necessary ; checks and redistributes
ammunition ; and regains rapidly a state of readiness
for combat When required supply elements maybe brought
forward Upon the arrival of the supply elements tanks are
refueled and ammunition replaced First aid is rendered at
this time by members of the unit and by attached medical
personnel which usually arrives with the maintenance personnel
Walking wounded are directed to the most conveniently
located aid station
(b) Upon completion of the reorganization each tank unit
commander reports to his next superior the combat condition
of his unit As soon as known he issues instructions to his
commanders covering the future action of his unit with special
reference to the next objective the route the formation
special missions and the time to start
(2) If unable to reach the rallying point or if at any time
it becomes necessary to rapidly reform to renew the attack
or to meet an immediate hostile threat a tank unit is rallied
as prescribed in FM 7-5
k Continuation of attack -The direction and continuity
of the attack is of first importance Continuity of the attack
is mainained by timely movement and employment of reserves
and by rapid reorganization and continuation of the
attack on the next position or movement toward the next
objective after successful assault on a hostile position When
the hostile position is broken through reconnaissance elements
followed by tank units immediately move out and continue
the advance Continuous pressure must be kept on the
enemy in order that exploitation or pursuit may begin at the
earliest practicable moment
Pursuit -The situation determines to what extent pursuit
is carried out The attack order issued by the commander
informs subordinates whether or not to pursue If a pursuit
is ordered the elements to make the pursuit are designated
and the limit of pursuit is prescribed in the attack order
Upon reaching the limits of the pursuit elements are assembled
and conducted to the rallying or alternate rallying points
m Service park -( ) Except for the light maintenance
vehicle the maintenance sections do not accompany their
combat units in the approach march The unit motor officer
selects a position for the unit service park where maintenance
c0
TACTICS AND TE HNIQUE 47
elements assemble when combat units attack The service
park may be established at the assembly position intermediate
position or other suitable position in rear of the line of
departure where water and cover or concealment are available
as dictated by the situation The unit motor officer is
responsible for 'the operation and immediate defense of the
unit service park He follows the course of action of the
combat units by radio or other means so as to be able to meet
conditions promptly Unit maintenance officers direct the
work of their unit maintenance in the service park
(2) Light maintenance vehicles accompany their units as
far forward in the approach as practicable but not beyond
the line of departure When their units cross the line of
departure maintenance vehicles and motorcycles are assembled
at a predesignated place in the vicinity of a supporting
unit command post or at a battalion or regimental service
park
(3) After combat light maintenance vehicles motorcyclists
and heavier maintenance elements may be directed to
rejoin their units at the rallying or alternate rallying points
Maintenance is continued to the last practicable moment before
combat and is resumed at the first opportunity during or
after combat The location of vehicle casualties is reported
to the service park
n Medical unit and detachments -( ) The operations of
the medical unit and detachments are covered in detail in
FM 8- 0
(2) In general regimental aid stations are established in
the vicinity of the service park Battalion sections accompany
their combat units in the approach and establish battalion
aid stations in the vicinity of the battalion service park where
the light maintenance vehicles and motorcyclists are located
Litter bearers of units remain at their battalion aid stations
Litter bearers of infantry units follow closely behind the
infantry and artillery elements Company first aid men of
infantry and artillery elements accompany them into action
(3) The commander of the medical battalion establishes
collecting points in rear of the battalion aid stations and as
near to them as ambulances can be operated with reasonable
safety Provisions are made for collecting platoons to evacuate'the
wounded from the' aid stations to the collecting stations
where clearing companies evacuate them to the rear
07
47-48 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(4) After combat the battalion sections accompany the light
maintenance vehicles when they rejoin their units and establish
aid stations when and where needed
o Trains -The supply echelons are consolidated under the
command of the train commander G-4 (S-4 in smaller
units) directs the employment of the supply echelons in acccrdance
with the situation and plan of supply The train
commander is in charge of their movement and bivouac and
is responsible for reconnaissance of their routes and for their
security (See FM 7-50 )
â 48 MEETING ENGAGEMENT -a General -A meeting engagement
may result from uncertainty or obscurity in the
situation such as In the meeting of small units or when reconnaissance
is ineffective Again it may occur when each opponent
is cognizant of the other but both decide to attack
without delay to retain or gain some tactical advantage or to
gain a decisive terrain feature or because of a knowledge of
superiority over the other Except where armored units are
employed to rupture a position collision with hostile forces
will usually be in the nature of a meeting engagement
b Plans ( ) Preliminary planning Anticipatory planning
is essential to success in a meeting engagement Planning
starts with receipt of warning orders for the movement
All available data on the route or routes of march and terrain
of the zone of advance is obtained and information concerning
it disseminated to commanders The best available maps
are procured and distributed Aerial photographic reconnaissance
is used to supplement the maps Reconnaissance
strips and individual photographs are taken of critical points
and areas By study of these data and maps the commander
plans his march and disposes his subordinate units in various
columns so as best to develop for combat He determines the
critical points in the zone of advance and makes plans for
action against the enemy at those points He determines
points or areas where the enemy may be taken by surprise or
at a disadvantage and plans to force combat in such areas if
opportunity arises Plans are made flexible and troops are
disposed for control and to facilitate rapid entry into battle
Commanders of the main subdivisions of the command are
informed of these plans and given orders missions or tasks
for carrying them out

TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
48
(2) Dispositions Armored units advance usually in multiple
columns covered by advance flank and rear guards as
necessary and by reconnaissance elements well to the front
Usually medium tank units may be attached to light armored
regiments for the movement Medium tank units should be
placed well forward in the columns so that they may be used
to counter hostile mechanized threats and may enter into
combat without passing through the light tank organizations
Infantry may be attached to each column Each column
must be given artillery Tank destroyer elements are usually
detailed to march with flank columns to protect against a
mechanized attack
(3) Scheme of maneuver -Direct frontal attacks are
avoided when practicable and are made only when the hostile
flanks are unassailable The envelopment or double envelopment
is the usual method of attack Tank units seek to
encircle the enemy and attack him from the rear The
advance guard or guards are used to seize vital terrain to
limit the hostile advance to the front while the tank units
move around the flanks Infantry may be used to reinforce
the advance guard or all or part of it used to follow up the
tank attack
c Action as ""combat becomes imminent -As combat becomes
imminent the commander completes his plan of action
and gives final instructions for the operation
( ) Advance guard -Action of the advance guard is characterized
by speed and aggressiveness If Indications show
that the enemy is preparing to organize or is organizing a
defensive position the advance guard drives in the hostile
covering force and seeks to disrupt his defensive organization
If the advancing enemy is in a position unfavorable for our
attack the advance guard may fight a delaying action or
withdraw until the enemy has advanced to more favorable
ground for our attack However the advance guard must
not retire so far as to endanger or restrict the movement the of main body
(2) Artillery -(a) Artillery with advance guard -As contact
becomes imminent the artillery advances by leap frog- ging part of it always being in position to support the advance
guard action It opens long range fire on hostile columns and
09
48
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
interdicts routes of approach An artillery liaison officer
must be with the leading elements of the advance guard and
an artillery airplane furnished
(b) Artillery with main body -Artillery with the main
body is well forward so that it may quickly go into action
As contact becomes imminent the artillery prepares to reinforce
the advance guard to protect the flanks and to protect
the development of the main body When the situation is
obscure artillery advances by echelon part of it always being
in position to protect the column
(c) infantry -The Infantry may be used to support the
advance guards ; to seize and hold terrain to form a pivot for
maneuver It may seize assembly positions on the flanks
from which armored units launch their attacks It may be
held in reserve to follow the attacking echelons and assist in
the mopping up of the hostile forces
d Conduct of attack -( ) Control Control is chiefly
maintained by assigning a direction of attack and objective
In some cases a commander may be given a mission order
assigning him an objective and time of attack The force
commander may assign rallying points where he will regain
control Communication is chiefly by radio Liaison airplane
and messenger may be used
(2) Artillery Artillery gives close support in initial stages
of the attack by preparation fire and successive concentrations
and thereafter is used against resistances holding up
the attack Artillery observers are with forward units Artillery
interdicts routes of approach of enemy reinforcements
A part of it follows the attack closely so that it will be ready
to give close support in assisting in reducing small islands of
resistance holding up the attack
(3) Aviation -See paragraph 46
(4) Infantry -Infantry assists the attack by forming a
base of fire about which the tank units maneuver Where
unexpected hostile organized defenses are encountered and
cannot be avoided by tanks infantry is used to attack such
localities Infantry follows the tank echelon and consolidates
gains made
e Meeting engagement with unarmored troops -In a
meeting engagement with unarmored troops the attack is
pushed to a conclusion without delay If the hostile force
is known to be poorly disposed for defense the attack is

TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
48-49
launched promptly and aggressively with little or no fire support
in order to afford the enemy no time to develop and
concentrate his defensive means Armored units attack on
a broad front against a flank to engage the greatest possible
number of enemy troops simultaneously and permit a maximum
use of shock action combined with fire power of vehicular
weapons After the attack has passed through the hostile
dispositions its direction may be reversed and the
assault repeated Each march column may be given a certain
task in this operation so attacks may be launched simultaneously
Flank attacks may not be practicable in which
case frontal attacks usually on a narrow front in great depth
are made direct from march column Against unarmored
troops small reserves are held out
f Meeting engagement with hostile armored units -In a
meeting engagement with hostile armored units maximum
use is made of terrain to canalize and restrict the enemy's
maneuver If the advance guard is opposed by weak forces
the reserve of the advance guard may be used at once to
turn this attack into the main attack The main attack
force is composed of tank units It maneuvers to attack the
enemy from the flank or rear It has as its objective the
destruction of hostile artillery communication and service
elements Attempt is made by feints to cause the enemy to
dislocate his main body or reserves and thus place himself
in a vulnerable position Medium tank units may be used in
the leading attack echelons against armored forces A large
reserve Its held out and is located so as to facilitate its
employment with either the main or secondary attack
49 ATTACK AGAINST HOSTILE FORTIFIED POSITIONS -a General
-In general armored units avoid attacking enemy defensive
positions If practicable the position is screened by
all or part of the support echelon while the remainder of the
force passes around a flank of the hostile defenses and proceeds
on its mission After passage of this force screening
elements assemble and follow unless they are required to
remain to protect the line of communication Higher commanders
detail motorized infantry units to relieve the armored
infantry when necessary When the hostile defenses
cannot be screened and passed by armored forces seek to
turn the enemy out of position by encirclement Or envelop49-
50
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
ment of one or both flanks An attack of a fortified position
by penetration is unusual for an armored force acting alone
and should be made only when other maneuver is impracticable
or a weak spot can be found in the hostile defenses In
penetrations in cooperation with other large units of the
combined arms the zone of the initial break-through is neutralized
or breached completely by other troops Armored
divisions then enter the breach and launch their attack as a
passage of lines
b Attack by envelopment -When one or both hostile flanks
are vulnerable single or double envelopment is made The
support echelon is used to make the holding or secondary
attack while the striking force envelops or encircles one or
both hostile flanks Direction and time of attack and line
of departure are given for the secondary attack The striking
force is given a direction of attack including an objective
or objectives or it may be given a mission order an objective
and route or routes of approach being assigned It may
attack simultaneously with the support echelon but usually
attacks later The striking force seeks to attack the enemy
from the rear and destroy his artillery reserves communications
and supply installations
I
c Attack by penetration -When an attack by penetration
is necessary the support echelon in conjunction with the
infantry artillery engineers and combat aviation neutralizes
or breaks through the front to be attacked by the tank units
The attack is launched on a narrow front and in great depth
The striking echelon moves rapidly forward through'the gap
created or makes a passage of the infantry lines and advances
through the neutralized zone After passing through the
hostile position some tank units move to the right and left and
attack the enemy from the rear Other units continue to the
rear and attack hostile artillery reserves communications
and supply installations The Infantry assists the tank units
in mopping up the hostile position and in widening or maintaining
the gap (See figs 3 4 and 5 )

to push through the gap created and to exploit the success
gained GHQ reserve tank units operate with units detailed
to breach the hostile defenses
b Scheme of maneuver in break-through -To effect a
break-through and exploit such an operation the higher
commander masses his break-through troops usually special
units supported by large groups of artillery and such engineers
chemical troops and GHQ reserve tank units as are
necessary behind that portion of the line to be penetrated
Armored divisions and motorized infantry or cavalry divisions

are massed behind the break-through troops ready to be
pushed through the gap to be effected in the hostile line
Combat aviation is detailed to assist break-through troops
and delay hostile reinforcements Other troops are detailed
to attack all along the hostile line to confuse the enemy as to
the place and direction of the attack and delay movement of
reserves to meet such attack A feint may be made at some
other portion of the line to draw hostile reserves away from
the contemplated zone of penetration

through This employment is unusual The combat commands
in such operation are used similarly to GHQ reserve
tank units as explained in chapters 2 and 3
d Exploitation of a break-through by armored units -( )
General -The general methods employed in passing through
a gap in the hostile line and in exploiting aa penetration are
the same However in the first case the gap will probably be
found unexpectedly and time for deliberate reconnaissance
and preparation of plans will not be available In such a case
objectives are assigned and mission or task orders issued
In the latter case definite deliberately planned orders are
given
(2) Missions and obfectives -Missions assigned to armored
units in exploitation will be to attack hostile positions from
the rear ; attack and destroy hostile reserves and artillery ;
disrupt hostile communications command posts and supply
installations ; and to seize and hold vital terrain features or
areas until the arrival of other troops
(3) Preliminary preparations -Preliminary preparations
for exploitation of a break-through include reconnaissance
for routes and sites ; planning of movement to initial positions
and preparation of plans for the attack ; arrangements for
coordination with other units particularly with motorized
infantry supporting artillery and combat aviation ; arrangements
for attachment of other troops such as additional
engineer units if needed chemical troops combat aviation ;
and arrangements for supply and maintenance during the
operation
(a) Reconnaissance -Reconnaissance is made to determine
assembly and intermediate positions and routes and
zones of advance Routes to the front line held by friendly
troops are reconnoitered and arrangements made for marking
and for guides It must be remembered that the armored
units may be several miles behind the line of departure and
forward areas will be filled with troops detailed for the
break-through Map and aerial reconnaissance of the zone
of advance must be made
(b) Coordination with other units -Arrangements are
made with the break-through troops for necessary passage
of line Plans of action are coordinated by conference with
commanders of following motorized infantry divisions Liaison
officers should be sent to the headquarters of the break-

through units that are in the zone of the armored force
unit's advance and also to motorized troops that follow

sance units more closely than in other forms of attack Those
units detailed to attack to the right and left fan out as soon
as they emerge from the gap advance rapidly on their objectives
and after completion of their mission rally and proceed
on to the next objective Those units that are detailed
to more distant objectives move rapidly forward in columns

2 5 PURSUIT -a General -The pursuit is launched when
the enemy is decisively defeated A commander recognizes
success by the continued advance of his troops in a decisive
direction and the capture of critical objectives ; by the number
of captured prisoners and abandoned weapons ; by the
number of hostile dead ; by the diminution of hostile artillery
fire ; by the relaxation or cessation of hostile countermeasures ;
and from reports that the enemy is withdrawing
b Preparation for pursuit-When it is recognized that the
enemy is withdrawing the commander should immediately increase
pressure on the enemy to maintain continuity of the
attack He regroups his reserves and makes plans for encircling
and completing the destruction of the enemy He
organizes his command into a direct pressure and an encirdling
force A reorganization line usually a line of rallying
points is set from which to launch the pursuit
c Object of pursuit -The object of the pursuit is the
annihilation of the hostile forces Pursuit is pushed to the
utmost endurance of men and vehicles No opportunity must
be given to the enemy to reorganize his defense Direct pressure
is combined with an enveloping or encircling maneuver
to place troops across the enemy's line of retreat Every effort
must be made to prevent withdrawal of the enemy under
cover of darkness Units continue to advance after dark
d Direct pressure force -The function of the direct pressure
force is to keep continuous heavy pressure on the retreating
hostile force so that the enemy will not be able to disengage
any appreciable part of his troops and send them to
the rear or use them to delay the encircling force Pursuit
is launched without halting direct from a reorganization line
set by the commander when he plans the pursuit Reserves

are sent in to gain the hostile flank or rear and break through
his covering troops
e Encircling force -The encircling force seeks to place
itself across the enemy's line of retreat When practicable it
advances along roads parallel to the hostile line of retreat
and attempts to block the enemy at defiles and other critical
points When the encircling force is unable to outdistance
the enemy it attacks him in flank and delays him so that the
direct pressure force can attack and complete the destruction
If the encircling force is not able to move around a
flank it pushes through a gap in the hostile line and proceeds
on its mission
f Pursuit by armored forces in conjunction with other
arms -( ) General When operating with larger forces the
armored division is employed in the encircling maneuvers
around exterior hostile flanks or through a breach effected in
the hostile dispositions GHQ reserve tank units if available
are usually used with the direct pressure force when armored
divisions are present However some battalions may be
attached to the encircling force The action of GHQ reserve
tank units in pursuit is covered in chapters 2 and 3
(2) Terrain -Unsuitable terrain or secure flanks of the
enemy may limit pursuit operations to direct pressure initially
or may admit of only limited encircling maneuvers to
areas where the retreating columns can be checked until
overtaken and destroyed by troops which are following directly
Encircling forces sent to these areas are usually small consisting
primarily of infantry reinforced by reconnaissance
elements tanks artillery and engineers
(3) Cooperation with other troops Infantry engineers
artillery and chemical troops may be attached to an armored
force unit in an encircling movement Motorized divisions
may follow to consolidate gains made and to assist in the destruction
of the enemy Observation aviation reports on
positions of hostile columns Combat aviation attacks and
delays the hostile retreat ; thus giving the encircling force
time to place itself across the hostile line of retreat
(4) Conduct of the encircling force -(a) Reconnaissance
-Reconnaissance units operate on the flanks of the
retreating columns gain contact and report on the compositlon
and direction of movement -of hostile forces and execute
harassing missions

" units -Armored divisions usually advance in
parallel columns Reconnaissance elements of the armored
regiments precede the advance Engineers are attached each column to to assist in removal of road blocks and construc- tion of crossings Artillery is placed with the advance guard
or well forward In the main bodies The artillery must be prepared to occupy positions from which fire may be brought
to bear on any hostile threat Tank destroyer units are dis- posed In each column If the enemy has mechanized units attack by such units may be expected on the heads and near flank A medium tank unit therefore should be well forward
in the column However the outer flank must not be neglected
because hostile reinforcements may be sent in from
that direction
(c) Infantry --The Infantry with the encircling force fol- lows the armored units closely and takes over critical terrain gained by the tank units It holds these areas to halt or delay the retreating columns
(d) Control -Control is exercised by giving march objec- tives routes of advance boundaries phase lines intermediate objectives to be used as bases for reorganization and by com- munication principally by airplane radio and motor mes- senger
4 Pursuit by armored force acting alone-Q) General - An armored force unit acting alone pursues principally by encirclement applies its strength to hostile weaknesses strikes enemy personnel and materiel at or near the heads of the retreating columns and seeks to gain critical points or areas on the hostile route where the enemy can be halted and destroyed
(2) Direct pressure force -The support echelon is usually
employed as the direct pressure force It may have attached
to it GHQ reserve tank units if available or medium tank units from the striking force It pushes rapidly and aggres- sively forward keeping constant pressure on the hostile cov- ering forces Suitable missions for tank units with the direct pressure force include disorganization or destruction of hostile reserves supporting weapons observation posts and command and communication installations Such tank units are given zones or routes of advance and final objectives They ad- vance without regard to supporting fires using fire and move- ment within the unit They will usually after the initial

SECTION V
THE DEFENSIVE
0 52 GENERAL -a Role -The primary role of armored
forces on the defensive is the tactical offensive Their usual
employment will be in the counterattack However armored
divisions may for short periods organize and occupy a defensive
position
b GHQ reserve tank units -On the defensive GHQ reserve
tank units are employed primarily in counterattacks Their
use on the defensive is covered in chapters 2 and 3
c Types of defensive operations in which armored units
may participate -The usual types of defensive operations in
which armored units participate either when acting alone or
in conjunction with other troops are :
( ) Defense of a position
(2) Withdrawal
(3) Delaying action
â 53 DEFENSE OF POSITION WHEN ACTING ALONE-a General
-(I) An armored force acting alone may be forced to
take up a defensive position temporarily because of superior
hostile forces or it may have been assigned a mission to seize
and hold a critical point such as a bridgehead or a vital area
pending arrival of other troops
(2) The support echelon occupies the defensive position
while the striking force is used primarily for counterattacks
Reconnaissance elements perform their usual mission of reconnaissance
and in addition may be used for counterreconnaisso
nce and security missions
(3) The defense seeks to act by surprise Every effort is
made to conceal the nature of the defense and location of the
main line of resistance Changes in the defensive arrangements
camouflage dummy works and skillful screening by
security detachments in advance of the battle position mislead
the enemy and induce him to adopt faulty dispositions
By causing the enemy to take unfavorable dispositions the
20
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE 53
reserves of the defense consisting primarily of tank units
may be able to strike him a fatal blow
(4) Defense must be mobile The front covered by the
infantry regiment of an armored division will be small
therefore dependence must be placed upon the effective use
of large tank units as mobile r eserves FM 7-40 gives frontages
for infantry in defense
b Selection of position -As the Infantry will occupy and
defend the main battle position selection of such position
will conform to procedures laid down in FM 7-40 Full utilization
of all natural obstacles must be made to restrict the
direction and scope of the hostile attack When practicable
flanks should rest on impassable obstacles When this practicable is not ground should be selected with a view to limiting
as much as possible any flank attack The position should
afford good observation and fields of fire while denying to the
enemy observation over approaches to the position from the
rear Frequently it may be located on reverse slopes where
an adequate field of fire can be obtained
c Distribution of troops -( ) Usually the front is not defended
in uniform density Key points of terrain are occupied
and arrangements made to cover intervening spaces and
flanks by fires and counterattack of reserves Key points are
usually those terrain features that afford good observation
into the defensive position or over the foreground
(2) Troops on the defense are distributed in depth This
distribution provides for-
(a) Security and the necessary time for manning the
defenses of the battle position
(b) Screening the battle position and keeping the enemy
in doubt as to its location
(c) Facilitating 'r--elansce on the flanks and in the rear as well as to the front
(d) Avoiding offering the enemy a vulnerable concentrated target
(e) Providing suitable positions for reserves
(3) Troops are distributed in-
(a) A reconnaissance echelon
(b) A security or counterreconnaissance echelon
(c) A combat echeloh
(d) Reserves

d Reconnaissance -The reconnaissance battalion performs
its reconnaissance missions in all directions It contacts the
enemy and gives information of his strength composition and
movements It withdraws through or around the defensive
position and assists in flank protection It must be ready to
move out on reconnaissance when the offensive is resumed
Observation aviation performs its usual reconnaissance
missions
e Security and counterreconnaissance -Security detachments
protect the battle position from surprise ground attack
and screen it from hostile observation and investigation
Engineers assisted by infantry establish defended road blocks
and demolitions along the principal routes leading toward
the position Strong patrols operate between the obstacles
When necessary to accomplish greater delay than can be
expected by small infantry detachments not provided with
antitank guns tanks and artillery may be used to defend such
road blocks Elements of the reconnaissance company may
be used to defend road blocks and for patrolling between such
road blocks Outposts are ordinarily established within
range of light artillery supporting the main line of resistance
When beyond this range some light artillery is usually attached
to the outpost Local outguards sent out by units on
the main line of resistance are posted within range of infantry
supporting weapons When the battle position is on a reverse
slope it is protected by combat outposts on the crest These
are either made a part of or are protected by the combat
outpost When attack by mechanized forces is expected a
strong natural obstacle in the immediate front is a requisite
The reconnaissance battalion reinforced if necessary by the
reconnaissance companies of the light armored regiments
tank destroyer units may be used to form a Counterreconnaissance
screen across the front It may be reinforced
and employed to delay the enemy to give time for the defense
to be organized
f Battle position -The Infantry organizes and defends
the battle position in accordance with the methods discussed
in FM 7-40 All the artillery tank destroyer units except
that detailed for defense of certain road blocks are-used to
support this position The striking force is used primarily as
a reserve therefore infantry units need not hold out large
reserves This procedure is the reverse of that used by infantry
in an infantry division In the armored division the
tanks furnish the reserve whereas in the infantry division
a large mobile reserve must be held out when a wide
front is occupied In cases where a wide front must be defended
the Infantry may hold out no reserves and may have
attached to it small tank units for local reserves Under
exceptional circumstances individual tanks may when the
battle position is unduly extended be placed in a turret defl-

Crews and weapons of disabled tanks may be dismounted and
used to reinforce the battle positions (See fig 7 )
g Reserves -( ) Composition and location -Reserves
consist primarily of the tank units Depending upon the
terrain and the extent of the battle position reserves are
placed in one or more positions They are located in covered
positions preferably beyond range of light artillery fire
and where they have good routes of approach to counterattack
positions Where both flanks are open the striking echelon

(2) Counterattacks -Plans are made for counterattacking
the enemy from any direction Where flanks are secure the
counterattack will be made to restore the battle position
This attack does not stop at the main line of resistance but
continues on beyond to a limited objective to completely
disrupt the hostile attack When one or both flanks are
open to counterattacks plans are prepared not only against
hostile forces attacking in front but also against hostile envelopin

-(l) When employed in defense with other large bodies
of troops armored force units may be used to-
(a) Counterattack an enemy who has succeeded in penetrating
the position and disrupt his attack
(b) Attack an enveloping or encircling force
(c) Attack a hostile force that has committed itself to an
attack but has not yet penetrated the battle position
(2) Seldom will an armored division when operating with
other forces be assigned to hold a sector of the defensive
line A portion of the tank units particularly medium tank
units may be used to augment the antitank defense by taking
up positions where they may ambush hostile tanks that have
penetrated the position Thq armored artillery may be used
to augment the artillery of the defense However if the
armored division is to perform a semi-independent mission
against the flanks of attacking hostile forces or is to block
an envelopment then it should retain its artillery The use
of GHQ reserve tank units in the defense is discussed in
chapters 2 and 3
b Counterattacks ( ) Positions -If the armored division
is to be used as a whole in the counterattack it should be
located well to the rear in a covered area out of light artillery
range The location should permit of easy access to any
contemplated sector of employment
(2) Plans -By reconnaissance avenues of possible hostile
attack are determined Plans are then made for counterattacking
against any probable place of hostile penetration
Routes from the reserve position to the attack positions are
reconnoitered and assigned to various units Tentative zones
of action and lines of departure are assigned All arrangements
are made for quickly moving to attack positions and
launching the counterattack without delay
(3) Objectives -Objectives in front of the main line of
resistance are assigned in order to break up a hostile attack
formation Where the direction of the hostile attack has been
determined but the full force of the attack has nbt reached
the main line of resistance the armored force attack might
be launched against the flank of such hostile attack
(4) Support echelon The support echelon usually follows
and consolidates the gains of the striking echelon as in
offensive operations
27
54-55
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(5) Artillery -Artillery supports the attack initially by
concentrations on hostile troops All artillery in the area
should be used to support the attack
(G) Engineers -Engineers prepare routes of approach for
the attacking tank units
(7) Reconnaissance units Reconnaissance units are
either retained in reserve or given reconnaissance screening
counterattack or flank protection missions
(8) Conduct of attack -The conduct of the attack is the
same as the offensive (see sec IV) except that after the
attack tank units withdraw to a previously designated area
behind the battle position unless the offensive is to be
immediately assumed
c Attack of an enveloping or encircling force -The attack
of a hostile enveloping or encircling force is similar to an
attack in a meeting engagement Against unarmored troops
the support echelon is used to block the hostile advance while
the striking force maneuvers to strike the enemy in the flank
or rear Against armored troops the support echelon supported
by a part of the striking force blocks the advance
while the remainder of the striking force maneuvers to
attack the hostile flank
d Attack against hostile force that has committed itself
to attack but has not yet penetrated battle position -This is
a defensive-offensive operation The commander of the
whole force may take up the defensive to require the enemy
to deploy and attack By using the armored force from concealed
positions on the flank or even by passing the armored
units through his own line in a certain area the commander
may strike the enemy in flank or rear The enemy should be
struck after he has made his dispositions and launched his
attack but before he has penetrated the battle position This
operation requires careful timing The striking echelon
leads the attack and may be followed by the support echelon
55 WITHDRAWAL FROM ACTION -a General -Tactical doctrine
covering withdrawal from action by armored force units
is contained in FM 00-5 Action of GHQ reserve tank units
in withdrawal is discussed in chapters 2 and 3
b Armored force units in withdrawal -An armored force
unit may participate in withdrawal either as part of a larger
force or when acting alone In withdrawal its use is prima-
28
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
55
rily offensive to delay or break up hostile attacks and by so
doing relieving pressure so that the withdrawal may be
accomplished without undue casualties Armored forces
except the armored infantry are seldom used during night
withdrawal Tank units are used during the day for counterattack
to assist other troops in holding out until night in
order that withdrawal may be made under cover of darkness
c Withdrawal when acting alone-( ) Daylight with- drawal -In daylight withdrawal It may be expected that a
series of delaying actions will be fought The large withdrawal of units in daylight is dangerous and many casualties
may be expected
(a) Scheme of maneuver -A rearward position is desig- nated on which troops will prepare for renewal of resistance or under the protection of which they may be assembled for
further retrograde movement A covering force consisting of a part of the striking force is used to assist in the disengagement
of the infantry The infantry is disengaged and moves to the rear Reconnaissance units assist in flank protection
(b) Rearward position -The rearward position and routes thereto should be thoroughly reconnoitered Its selection is based upon the natural protection it affords against attack of hostile troops It should have good routes leading to its rear
(c) Covering force-The covering force will consist pri- marily of tank units and should be strong in medium tanks A part of the artillery may be attached to the covering force Engineers may be attached for demolition purposes The purpose of the covering force is to slow down or halt the hos- tile attack and protect the rearward movement of other troops
(d) Conduct of withdrawal -Counterattacks are made by reserves to halt or slow down the hostile attack The cover- ing force takes a position from which it may block the hostile advance Small tank units may be moved into turret defilade positions in or in rear of the infantry lines to protect the infantry withdrawal Artillery supports the withdrawal by concentrations on hostile troop concentrations and interdic- tion of critical areas Engineers'destroy bridges and perform other demolitions that will delay the hostile attack Combat aviation assists in the withdrawal by attacking hostile troop

concentrations and reinforcements Trains are withdrawn
first Infantry units in front lines as they are relieved by
tank units move to the rear in small groups entruck and
move to the rearward position Artillery withdraws by
echelon Tank units supported by tank destroyer units fight
a delaying action to protect the withdrawal of the remainder
of the force Reconnaissance units protect the flanks and
if and when action is broken off by the main force keep
contact with the enemy Maximum resort is made to ambush
tactics and delay in intermediate positions
(2) Night withdrawal-Whenever practicable troops hold
out until night to make a withdrawal By counterattacking
before dark with tank units pressure may be relieved and
organization of the night withdrawal made easier Rearward
positions are selected routes reconnoitered and all necessary
plans made as prescribed for a daylight withdrawal The
covering force will consist of elements of infantry tank destroyer
and artillery and operates in accordance with doctrine
prescribed in FM 00-5 Reconnaissance units protect
the flanks and are used as an additional covering force The
reconnaissance companies of the armored (tank) regiments
together with tank destroyer units may be attached to the
reconnaissance battalion for this maneuver When the
covering screen is withdrawn the reconnaissance units close
across the zone and cover the withdrawal They contact and
maintain contact with hostile units Troops withdrawn to
the rearward position may organize that position or retire
under the protection of a rear guard It will be unusual to
assign tanks to such'a force
d Withdrawal when opposed by unarmored troops -When
opposed by unarmored troops in a withdrawal the striking
force attacks to disrupt hostile forces Other units disengaged
by the tank attack move to the rear The striking
echelon then moves to the rear followed by the reconnaissance
elements
e Withdrawal when acting with other large bodies o}
troops -( ) General -When operating with other large
bodies of troops armored units are used primarily In daylight
withdrawal The support echelon may be used as a covering
force The artillery may and usually will be used to augment
the artillery of the defense The tank units may
be used either as a unit or in two or more units for launching

counterattacks In some cases the armored division and in
large forces the armored corps may be used to make a wide
encircling movement to move behind the hostile lines to
attack the hostile rear and break up and disorganize the
hostile attack Conduct of such forces is the same as in the
offensive Armored force units reinforced by tank destroyer
elements will be particularly effective as a covering force
acting against hostile armored units
(2) Counterattacks -The primary use of armored force
units in the withdrawal in conjunction with larger bodies of
troops will be in the counterattack Such attacks may be
made by the entire striking force or any portion of it The
piecemeal employment of tank units is wrong ; they must be
used in large numbers in a coordinated effort When hostile
mechanized forces are expected medium tank units should
be assigned each attack force and used primarily to lead the
attack Counterattacks in withdrawal are usually limited
objective attacks made on a broad front to delay and disrupt
the hostile attack
(3) Scheme of maneuver -See paragraph 54
56 DELAYING ACTION -a General -Procedure governing
delaying action ii;' covered in FM 00-5 The purpose of
delaying action is to give the main force time to retire to
consolidate positions or time and space to deploy for offensive
action GHQ reserve tank units may be attached to motorized
infantry or cavalry divisions engaged on delaying missions
A portion or all of an armored division reinforced by
tank destroyer units may be used on delaying missions
When advancing hostile columns contain armored units armored
units should be used against them The methods
employed vary from use of small groups to defend road
blocks or temporary defense of a natural obstacle to methods
involving offensive action by tank units such as limited objective
attacks and ambush Armored force units may be
employed alone or in conjunction with other forces It may
delay in one or successive positions If acting alone delay
in successive positions will be normal terrain permitting
b Scheme of maneuver -In delaying action by armored
force units one combat command is used to occupy delaying
positions to check the hostile advancing columns while the
other echelon with engineers threaten or attack the hostile

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
flanks or rear Combat aviation is used to attack hostile
columns troop concentrations and artillery Reconnaissance
elements keep the columns under constant surveillance
When operating with larger forces against hostile armored
units tank units together with tank destroyer units are used
to protect the flanks of the troops on the delaying position
to limit penetrations and to deliver counterattacks
c Selection of position -Good -observation long-range
fields of fire covered routes of withdrawal and secure flanks
are desirable for a delaying position When opposed to hostile
armored troops a position covered by natural obstacles
is highly desirable Successive positions should be separated
by such distance that hostile artillery will be forced to displace
in order to fire effectively Infantry units may however
have to occupy intermediate positions for mutual
support
d Delaying action when acting alone -When operating
alone as a delaying force armored units may be required to
cover a broad front in order to delay the various hostile
columns It will usually operate in two or more groups
against the heads flanks and if practicable the rear of
hostile columns For such operations an armored division
utilizes its combat command groups consisting of tanks infantry
artillery tank destroyers engineers and reconnaissance
units Each combat command group will be given a
certain column or a zone to delay
( ) Delay of hostile unarmored units--In the delay of hostile
unarmored units infantry and engineers will usually be
used to block the advance of the hostile columns while tank
units attack the flank and rear of such columns Some engineers
and reconnaissance units should be attached to the
maneuvering force The tank attack as in withdrawal is
characterized by quick powerful blows to disorganize the
enemy
(2) Delay of hostile armored units -In the delay of hostile
armored units enemy effort is made to locate each delaying
position behind a formidable natural obstacle The infantry
supported by artillery and tank destroyer units occupies the
position Engineers place obstacles in front of the position
Tank units are held in reserve to protect the flanks and to
execute counterattacks These counterattacks are characterized
by rapid blows to disorganize the enemy attack They

may be launched before the enemy has reached our own front
lines They are usually followed by rapid withdrawal to a
reserve position
e Delaying action in conjunction with other troops ( )
Against unarmored troops -Against unarmored troops armored
units when acting in conjunction with other troops
are used as in d( ) above
(2) Against armored troops --When operating in conjunction
with other troops in delay against an enemy having
armored elements armored units are usually left in reserve
to be used to protect the flanks and to counterattack The
counterattack is usually conducted as in d(2) above However
armored divisions may be used to move around a flank
of the delaying position and attack the enemy in flank
f Withdrawal -Withdrawal in delaying action is accomplished
as previously described Withdrawal starts before
units become heavily engaged in order to avoid losses If the
delaying force does become heavily engaged every effort should
be made to hold out until dark for a night withdrawal
SECTION VI
SPECIAL OPERATIONS
â¢ 57 GENERAL -The general procedure governing special
operations is contained in FM 00-5 Armored units participate
in special operations primarily by employment of offensive
action Such operations include attack or defense of a
river line attack in woods attack and defense of towns and
cities and to a limited extent night operations The fundamentals
of attack and defense discussed in sections IV and V
apply to these operations
â¢ 58 NIGHT OPERATIONS a General -In general night
operations of armored units will consist of night marches
movement into position and defense Collision with hostile
tank units at night will be rare because of the protective
reconnaissance and security elements However in pursuit
armored units continue the advance to the limit of their
ability at night
b Infantry in night operations The technique of employment
of infantry in night operations is covered in FM
00-5' and 7-40 Infantry in the support echelons of

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
armored forces may when the division occupies a defensive
position make a local night attack to gain information to
seize defiles or to secure ground from which tank units may
launch a daylight attack Again infantry may be used at
night to seize and hold vital terrain features on a flank to
protect advancing armored columns In some cases infantry
might even make an attack to throw a hostile column into
confusion Hostile tank bivouacs' or assemblies may provide
remunerative objectives for infantry night attack
c Reconnaissance units -Use of reconnaissance units is
covered in chapter 4
d Tank units -The use of tank units in night operations
will be limited to local defense except in delaying action and
pursuit Observation from a tank is poor at the best and in
a night attack they would be very much at the mercy of

an infantry attack It may be used to fire against hostile
troop concentrations and for interdiction Use of artillery

â 59 ATTACK AGAINST RIVER LINE ---a General -Procedure
in attacks against a river line is covered in FM 00-5
Armored units may take part in such operations as part of a
large force or may when acting alone find it necessary to
force a river crossing (see eh 9 for combat command groupings)
GHQ reserve tank units must be reinforced by other
troops particularly engineers when the necessity for crossing
of unfordable streams can be foreseen Armored divisions
carry some bridging equipment but must be reinforced by
additional engineer troops when wide rivers are to be crossed
or crossings are to be made at several points simultaneously
b Types of action -Operations in the attack of a river

line may be classed as hasty crossings of small streams streams or large where bridges can be seized intact and forced cross- ings of large streams
c Surprise - Surprise in a river crossing is as essential as in any other operation Every effort must be made to deceive the enemy as to the actual point or points of crossing so he w ll not be able to mass his defensive means against the
operations Frequently feints are made at two or more points
while the actual crossing is made at another point The first troops usually cross just before daylight Smoke may be used to coi:coal Lhe crossing or used at the place where feints are made
d Security-Air superiority is essential in forcing a cross- ing of large strearns Antiaircraft artillery protects the bridging operations
r
e Reconnaissance -Prior to any operation all available data are assembled concerning streams to be crossed This includes width depth swiftness of current condition of bot- tom and banks fordability location of fords and bridges observation on each side of the stream and natural defen- sive strength of positions on hostile side Preparations are then made to provide the necessary units and materiels to cross the streams Engineers and tank destroyer units are attached Extra bridging equipment may be necessary All preparations praci~cable are made in order that a rapid crossing may be made
f Hasty crossings -( ) General -This type of crossing will occur frequently in pursuit exploitation and enveloping
movements Minor hostile resistance may be encountered or the enemy may be prepared to give deliberate resistance to crossing Bridges will usually be found destroyed and fords mined or damaged Engineers protected by infantry and tank destroyer units must be prepared to give prompt assist- ance in repairing or improvising crossings and in removal of obstructions and mines Advance units must act with
boldness and energy to seize bridges before the enemy is able to damage them
(2) Fordable streams-(a) Streams fordable for great
distance-Reconnaissance elements endeavor to locate un- defended or lightly defended crossing points They seize such points and hold them until arrival of other troops The attacking unit may cross on a broad front Part of the unit

by either firing from vehicles in covered positions or by using
weapons in dismounted positions cover the crossing by fire
while other vehicles are pushed rapidly across the stream and
attack the enemy from the rear Smoke if available is used
to screen hostile weapons and observation points Artillery
when present supports by concentrations on hostile defenders
and by counterbattery fire Medium tank units may be used
to support the crossing When the enemy has organized a
defense on the opposite bank the Infantry with tank destroyers
and engineers are used to effect the crossing (See
FM 7-40 )
(b) Stream fordable at only few points -In this case fire
is brought on the hostile defenders as previously described
Dismounted men infantry and engineers or a portion of the
crew of the vehicles are used as a dismounted maneuvering
element to move across up or down stream from the hostile
defensive position and attack from the flank or rear to destroy
or neutralize antitank weapons These men are armed with
personal weapons and vehicular weapons such as caliber 30
machine guns Armament includes subcaliber machine guns
and grenades In attacking a defended stream the support
echelon supported by all the artillery tank destroyer and
engineers forces the crossing The bulk of the tanks are
kept in covered areas prepared to move across when the crossing
has been effected
g Crossing of unfordable streams by armored unit acting
alone-(I) General-In general armored units smaller than
a division unless reinforced by engineers rarely attempt to
force a river crossing when acting alone Armored divisions
and smaller armored units move forward rapidly and seize
the necessary crossings and bridgehead on the enemy's side
of the river Parachute troops may be used to seize bridges
initially They are rapidly relieved by armored troops If
it is impossible to seize a bridge intact armored units move
quickly to weakly or undefended portions of the river line and
effect a crossing Action is rapid and bold Usually limited
time will be available for detailed reconnaissance Anticipatory
planning is essential to the success of the operation
Rapid communication and exploitation of local successes are
also essential Crossings may be made either during the day
or at night

started to force a crossing in case the bridgehead desired
cannot be secured
(a) Scheme of maneuver -The scheme of maneuver is as
described in FM 00-5 After the Infantry has secured the
opposite bank and the bridge site from hostile small arms
fire some artillery tank destroyer and light tank units will
be ferried across The engineers build the bridge for the
remainder of the unit to cross Air superiority must be obtained
in daytime except in surprise crossings and antiaircraft
protection is furnished to troops building the bridge
(b) Infantry -The Infantry crosses in assault boats initially
Assigned objectives are seized and defensive positions
to secure the bridgehead are occupied Preparations are made
to break up hostile counterattacks Antitank guns and tank
destroyer element must be ferried across in the leading waves
(c) Artillery -All the artillery supports the attack initially
by concentrations on hostile positions counterbattery and
interdiction
(d) Tank destroyer -Tank destroyer elements are ferried
across early in the operation to assist the Infantry in antitank
defense The tank destroyer battalion crosses as soon as the
bridge is constructed and before tank units
(e) Engineers -Engineers with the reconnaissance units
reconnoiter the bridge sites and construct the bridges The
bridge company must be well forward in the column in the approach
so that assault boats will be available to the Infantry
at once and ponton equipment available for starting bridge
construction and for ferrying when needed The engineers
operate the assault boats and construct the bridge
(f) Reconnaissance elements -If hostile resistance is
slight reconnaissance units are crossed behind the Infantry
and continue on reconnaissance If hostile resistance is
heavy reconnaissance units are crossed after the tank units
(g) Tank units -Tank units are crossed as soon as the
bridge is constructed and follow the reconnaissance units
Artillery may be crossed with tank units
(h) Trains are crossed after all other troops and only when
the bridgehead is secure
(i) Time of attack -In this action time is essential Surprise
is essential and is obtained by secrecy deception and
speed of action The crossing Is forced at the earliest time
that preparations can be made A bridgehead must be ob-

tained during daylight hours of the day the attack is launched
It Attack of river line by armored forces in conjunction
with other troops -(l) General-When operating with other
troops in forcing a river crossing armored units are usually
held well to the rear in covered positions until other troops
have secured the bridgehead However armored divisions
may be used to effect a surprise crossing as previously described
and attack the enemy from the rear The armored
artillery may be used to reinforce the artillery of the bridgehead
troops It must however be ready to move forward
with the division
(2) Plans -When armored forces are to cross after the
bridgehead has been established plans are made and tentative
objectives are set so that it may best be employed to
exploit the crossing Plans must be flexible to take advantage
of the enemy situation Assembly positions of such armored
forces are selected with a view to rapid movement to any
point where a successful crossing has been made
â 60 DEFENSE of A RIVER LINE -a General The general
procedure for defense of river lines is covered in FM 00-5
A river is often used as an obstacle in front of a defensive
or delaying position It may be used as an aid in defensiveoffensive
action
b General scheme for defense of river line -Usually a river
line is not held in strength as a defensive position Units
are assigned such wide sectors that strong defense along the
river bank is impracticable The entire river line is covered
by patrols stationed to give warning of an attack Certain
favorable crossing points may be held by strong detachments
The bulk of the force is held in one or more reserve positions
ready to move to defend any threatened point of crossing or
to counterattack any hostile forces that have crossed
c Employment of armored forces in defense of river lines -
In defense of a river line armored units are most effectively
used as a powerful mobile reserve to attack hostile units that
have succeeded in crossing the river Both GHQ reserve
tank battalions and armored divisions may be used for this
purpose GHQ reserve tank units will seldom defend a river
line alone Armored divisions may defend a river line in
conjunction with other troops either being employed as a
reserve or to hold a sector on the river or they may defend
38
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
a river line alone pending the arrival of other troops
d Employment as reserve of a larger force in defense of a
river line ti) GHQ reserve tank units -In defense of a river
line GHQ reserve tank units are habitually employed in
reserve They may be attached by battalion unit to infantry
or cavalry divisions for operation with the reserves of such
units They are seldom employed in units smaller than a
battalion
(2) Armored divisions -Arrpored divisions employed reserve as a of larger units may be employed as a whole or used in two or more combat command groups each consisting
of reconnaissance light and medium tanks artillery tank
destroyer infantry and engineer units The most effective
use will be to counterattack the main enemy forces while they
are in the midst of crossing or before they have had time
to organize or consolidate after crossing The division should
be kept Intact when the road net and other conditions permit
(3) Position of reserves -The road net and condition of cross-country approaches as well as cover concealment and the tactical situation determine the position of armored
units in reserve In general reserve positions must fulfill the same conditions as those in the defense of a position They must facilitate speedy entrance into combat in any planned
area of operation GHQ reserve tank units usually are held near the general reserve of the unit to which they are
attached
(4) Plans -Procedure in planning for the use of the reserve
in defense of a river line is the same as in the defense of a position After receiving the plan of the sector commander
in whose sector he is operating the commander of an armored
unit by detailed reconnaissance and conference with unit
commanders in whose subsector he may operate makes plans
to meet all possible action by the enemy As in defense de- tailed plans are made for counterattacks and full coordina- tion of effort and a plan of supporting fires is made in cooperation
with other ground unit commanders When the armored
unit' is located in two or more groups situated to support the defense of different subsectors plans are made for the
speedy movement of such reserves to support the movement of any one unit (See fig )

tact with the hostile force on the enemy side of the river
(6) Artillery -The artillery should be left with the armored
units to be employed by them in the counterattack When
the armored division is divided into two or more combat
command groups each may require some artillery
(7) Engineers -Engineers are employed to prepare routes
of approach and some are attached to each group in reserve
(8) Infantry -Infantry is employed as indicated in FM
7-40 The armored infantry should remain with the armored
division and should not be used as a separate reserve for
other units A part of it may be attached to armored regiments
detailed in separate reserve locations â¢
(9) Tanks -Light and medium tank units are used in the
counterattack As the enemy will ferry antitank guns across
early medium tank units should be used in the leading waves
of the attack When attack is made to reduce a bridgehead
hostile tanks may be encountered The fundamentals of
tank versus tank combat then apply (See par 43 )
( 0) Control -Prior to an attack communication is primarily
by messenger Telephone may be used between larger
units In attack radio is the principal means of communication
Control is exercised as in the counterattack
( ) Conduct of attack -The attack is conducted as a
counterattack in defense of a position When the attacking
force reaches Its objective usually the river bank where bridging
work is in progress or a bridge has been built the tanks
attack the enemy byy fire while infantry and engineers destroy
the bridge Tank units are then withdrawn to a reserve
position
( 2) Time of attack -The attack is preferably launched
Before the enemy has established a bridgehead and started
bridging operations It is launched as soon as the location
of the hostile main effort is determined
e Employment in defensive-o ffensive -In defensive-offensive
operations attempt is made to strike the enemy while
he is astride the river Some armored units may cross the
river and attack the enemy in rear or flank Action will be
similar to a meeting engagement in the offensive Other
units may counterattack troops already crossed
f Defense of river line when acting alone -( ) Scheme of
defense When acting alone an armored force defends a

the hostile side of the river ; local patrols along the bank ;
local defense elements at most favorable points of crossing ;
local reserves in defensive sectors ; and a large general reserve
No attempt is made to hold the river line in strength
at any one point
(2) Reconnaissance elements -Reconnaissance elements
operating against advancing hostile forces delay the enemy
and report his movements Air observation is used to the
maximum When forced across the river reconnaissance
elements assist in patrolling the river line and protecting
the flanks
(3) Engineers -Engineers prepare bridges for destruction
and routes of approach for tank units
(4) infantry -Infantry patrols the river line and furnishes
local reserves at the most likely crossing points
(5) Tanks -Tank units are held in reserve for counterattack
use
(6) Artillery -Some of the artillery supports the Infantry
but the bulk is held in mobile reserve prepared to support the
striking echelon
(7) Destruction of fords and bridges -Fords and bridges
are prepared for destruction Those not to be used by withdrawing
reconnaissance and delaying elements are destroyed
Others are prepared for destruction These points are defended
by fire of automatic weapons and tank destroyer elements
When reconnaissance units have withdrawn the
bridge or ford is destroyed An officer must be stationed at
the bridge or ford prepared to instantly destroy it if it is in
danger of falling into hostile hands This officer must act
upon his own initiative and not wait for instructions from
higher authority
(8) Conduct of defense -The defense is conducted as in the
defense of a position
6 COMBAT IN TowNs --a General -In general armored
vehicles are not suitable for combat in towns particularly
large towns Towns offer concealment to large forces observation
is limited fire effect is reduced and combat deteriorates
to that of small groups Such localities enable the
enemy to effectively use antitank weapons barricades
demolitions and mines
b Attack of a town -Armored units if practicable avoid
42
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
6 -22
attacking towns If attack must be made the town circled A is en- direct frontal attack is resorted to only when
encirclement is impossible
( ) Attack by encirclement -The support echelon with part of the artillery makes the direct assault on the town while tank units move around one or both flanks to cut off the forces in the town from reinforcements and isolate it from hostile
supporting forces â¢ When no infantry is present part of the tank units supported by machine gun elements is used for the main attack
(2) Frontal attack -This form of attack is resorted to only as a last resort or when the locality can be surprised The Infantry supported by all the artillery makes the attack Tank destroyer and tank units will usually be used only to repel counterattacks after the town has been taken When
no Infantry is available elements of the reconnaissance and
battalion headquarters companies may be used in the assault while tank and artillery units cover the advance by fire
(See FM 7-5 )
c Defense of town -In defense of a town infantry supported
by artillery and tank destroyer units are used to de- fend the town itself while tank units are held in reserve to attack enveloping forces When a tank unit is acting alone it uses its mobility- to attack the enemy before he reaches the
outskirts (See FM 7-40 )
62 COMBAT IN WooDs --a General -The effect of woods
upon movement of tanks has been previously discussed
Woods may be both a help and a hindrance to armored units
in combat They are a help in that they afford cover and concealment However observation in woods is limited ; large closely spaced trees slow down or prevent movement
except on roads or paths Control in woods is difficult direction
is easily lost and mixing of units often results Tracts
of heavy woods tend to canalize an attack Woods facilitate
enemy antimechanized defense The concealment of antitank
guns is easy Demolitions barricades and mines can
be used to good effect
b Attack on woods-( ) Hostile defenses -Owing to the
excellent artillery target presented by the edge of a woods
defensive works are either placed some distance in front of or
back from the edge The position will depend largely on the field of fire
43
62-64
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(2) Scheme of maneuver -Tank units seek to avoid heavy
woods Smoke is used to blind observation and antitank
guns in the front edges and flanks Where woods must
be
attacked frontally the Infantry when available supported
by heavy artillery fire makes the attack When infantry is
not available tank units supported by artillery tank destroyers
mortars and other tank units make the attack
(3) Conduct of attack -When tanks reach their objectives
they must not halt in the edge of woods Directions may be
given and tanks push on through the woods In heavy
woods when trails only can be used antitank mines and antitank
guns may and probably will be encountered and ambush
may be expected After the initial assault and when the distance
through the woods is great reconnaissance units may
precede the tanks When emerging from woods tanks must
be deployed
c Defense of woods-The support echelon defends woods
as outlined heretofore for the defense Tank units are held
in reserve to counterattack hostile attacking forces Tanks
may be concealed in woods through which they may move
by previously reconnoitered routes to attack a hostile force
in flank This maneuver is especially effective in counterattacking
hostile tanks that seek to avoid heavy woods
0 63 ATTACKS IN MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY -Operations in
mountainous terrain usually limit tanks to defiles which are
easily defended by antitank guns and antitank mines Infantry
and engineers supported by artillery clear the defiles
and the tanks attack the enemy after debouching from the
passes Air superiority is a requisite to moving through
mountain passes during daylight hours (See FM 3 - 5 )
2 64 TANK VERSUS TANK COMBAT -a General ( ) Large
tank units and armored divisions are highly effective means
to counter hostile mechanized forces They are used in an
offensive manner in large numbers in execution of definite
missions The employment of these units on such missions
must be closely coordinated with and supported by all other
available antimechanized means including tank destroyer
units and combat aviation Tanks must not be used as stationary
pill boxes
(2) When tanks are assigned a mission that does not con-
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE 64
template the engagement of hostile tanks they should not be
diverted from such mission except-
(a) When forced to engage hostile tanks as a matter of
self-preservation
(b) When it is apparent that the hostile attacks will
seriously disrupt the operations of other troops
(3) When hostile tanks are superior in armor and armament
combat is avoided if practicable When these conditions
exist effort is made to draw the enemy into our own
mine fields or into areas covered by friendly tank destroyer
weapons
(4) Maneuvers should be planned and executed so as to
destroy the enemy in detail Flank attacks in close formations
to bring a great volume of fire on successive waves supported
by tank destroyer elements are most effective Speed
is used to maneuver to a deflladed or covered position from
which accurate fire from a halted tank may be brought to
bear on hostile tanks When the hostile armament outranges
that of our own closing within range of the enemy guns is
avoided unless effective fire can be brought to bear from
defilade Attack with a view to collision is avoided unless
out of ammunition or almost out of gasoline Tanks so used
will probably be sacrificed Under exceptional circumstances
when other means are not available and time is a
deciding factor a tank may be used to block a defile
(5) Medium tank units owing to their superior armor and
armament are used to lead attacks against hostile mechanized
units They are supported by tank destroyer units
(6) Tank crews must be carefully trained in-
(a) Recognition of hostile and friendly tanks by silhouette
(b) Characteristics and capabilities of hostile tanks pertaining
to armor armament and speed
(c) Vulnerable parts of hostile tanks upon which fire will
be effective
(d) Range at which our weapons are effective against
hostile vehicles
(e) Hostile methods of tank employment
(f) Methods of combating hostile tanks such as use of
speed defilade and cover and ambush
(g) Cooperation with tank destroyer elements
b Offensive action -( ) Tank units on the offensive will
be used to deliberately attack hostile mechanized forces
45
64 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
Tank versus tank combat may result from contact with hostile
attacking units Tanks are most vulnerable to hostile
armored fighting vehicles when actively engaged with other
elements of the enemy and when undergoing reorganization
(2) In planning his action a tank unit commander must
consider the probability of hostile mechanized attack and
terrain where such attacks are possible Plans are made for
countering hostile mechanized attack and definite orders
given to units as to action in case of attack Flanks and rear
are particuiarly vulnerable Medium tank units and tank
destroyers when available are used not only to lead the
attack but also some units are detailed to protect the flanks
and rear Tank destroyer units also protect the flank and
rear When hostile mechanized attack is expected a large
reserve consisting prinrarlly of medium tank and tank destroyer
units should be held out This reserve must foilow
the attack by such routes as to be readily available to counter
hostile tanks
c Defense -( ) In the defensive tank units supplement
the employment of tank destroyer units in the antitank
defense They are used in large nunibers to counterattack
hostile mechanized elements that have penetrated the battle
position and to attack hostile forces in their assembly positions
or when they have launched the r attack but have not
yet reached the battle position
(2) The counterattack of tank units against hostile tanks
must be supported by fire of all available tank destroyer
weapons and artillery Support of bombardment aviation is
desirable and should especially be used when the attack is
made against hostile units that have not yet reached our
lines After contact has been made with hostile tanks fire
of large caliber supporting weapons will be limited because
of the danger of hitting friendly tanks
(3) Counterattacks are planned as described in section V
In counterattack against mechanized forces all available
cover is used to c ppi-oach those forces from the flank If
practicable ambush may be prepared Tank destroyer units
are espec ally suitable for use in ambush When used from
ambush tanks halt in covered or defiladed positions for
short periods to fire their heavy weapons
(4) Hostile tanks that break through the defensive position
must be attacked immediately by tank destroyer and

tank units They should not be allowed to penetrate deeply
into a position before counteraction is taken GHQ reserve
tank battalions supported by tank destroyers are suitable
for such missions The battalion will be given a certain
defined sector to cover It will in turn divide this into company
sectors The battalion as a whole is located in a central
reserve position from which it or any of its elements may
move quickly to any part of the sector to search for and
destroy hostile tanks As soon as an element has completed
its mission it returns to the central reserve position In this
way the greater part of the battalion will be ready for other
missions Liaison officers with the headquarters of the troops
holding the sector and battalion reconnaissance elements are
used to report locations of hostile tanks
SECTION VII
MARCHES
6 5 GENERAL -a FM 7-50 covers technique of marches
both administrative and tactical
b The armored division habitually marches in multiple
columns disposed so as to readily enter combat in accordance
with the plan of the commander It is preceded by
the reconnaissance battalion the reconnaissance companies
of the tank regiments and advance guards for each column
Columns are formed so that entry into bivouac assembly
areas or combat may be made with the least practicable
delay and confusion Doubling of units on the road must
be avoided
c The number and composition of columns varies with the
road net the tactical situation and the plan for employment
The columns are composed of combat command groups both
tanks and infantry artillery engineer and tank destroyer ;
light tanks usually lead Infantry with tank destroyer units
are placed in the lead ; during the hours of darkness ; when
the situation is obscure ; when the plan of employment
contemplates commitment of the infantry prior to the tanks ;
and when the employment of the tanks cannot reasonably
be foreseen Artillery is placed well forward in each column
Tank destroyer elements are disposed to protect the and flank rear Depending upon the condition of routes and the necessity for clearing hostile road blocks engineers are

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
attached to each column including a detachment with the
advance guard Infantry should be attached to the advance
guard when their use in reducing road blocks can be foreseen
d Control is maintained by designating march objectives ;
zones or routes of advance ; phase lines to be passed at designated
times or when ordered ; and by prescribing rates
of march
e Air superiority is a requisite for a successful daylight
march When air attacks are expected increased distance
must be taken between elements and in some cases advance
is made cross-country in small groups
f In the presence of hostile aviation and when secrecy
is vital night marches are habitual The infantry with
tank destroyer unit usually leads the march to secure assembly
areas for the division
66 FORMATION a (See â¢ ch 7 ) The armored division
may march in regimental columns or it may be formed
into combat command groupings with tank battalions as the
nucleus of each group Each such group may consist of light
tanks medium tanks artillery tank destroyers engineers
and infantry Within each column the light tanks usually
lead The artillery is placed well forward usually following
the light battalion
b Unit trains with the columns are usually grouped and
follow in rear of the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

their units The division trains march on a route away
from the exposed flank or in the center column where they
will have the maximum protection afforded by the combat
