"Will it be harder to protect utilities as customers embrace smart grid technologies?

There have been 25 serious incidents investigated involving nation-state attackers going after Canadian critical infrastructure. (Ryan Pilon/CBC)
Electrical utilities around the world are under increasing attack by nation-states, organized crime, terrorist groups and activists, all seeking the capability to cause widespread disruption and chaos. 

With two confirmed massive power outages in Ukraine now attributed to successful attacks by nation-state backed hackers, what used to be something out of a Hollywood movie has become a real threat to power utilities around the world. 

And as utilities and their customers embrace smart grid technologies and internet-connected thermostats, refrigerators, heating and cooling units, televisions, lights and so much more, protecting an increasingly connected electrical system is about to get much more difficult. 

What does Ukraine hack matter?
In 2015, a group with suspected ties to the Russian government launched a fairly basic hack that took out power to 200,000 customers in Ukraine for a few hours. That was the first wakeup call.

In 2016, they launched a second attack that was much more automated and used software that showed signs it could be adapted to target electrical utilities in North America. 

In 2016, an access to information request revealed that Public Safety Canada had investigated 25 serious incidents involving nation-state attackers going after Canadian critical infrastructure, including our power grid. 

And in 2016,  there were concerns raised by the opposition that the 4.6 million smart meters there were vulnerable to hacking. 

Are there risks for New Brunswick?
We know from warnings from the intelligence agencies in the U.S. that groups like ISIS are working day and night to figure out ways to turn off the lights in North America. Their lack of success to date has more to do with the fact they're still bad at it than it does with how secure or robust our systems are. 

And keep in mind how integrated the power grid in North America is  remember the great northeastern outage of 2003? That was caused by a small utility in the United States becoming unstable, then a cascade failure that crippled large cities and communities from Toronto to New York. It affected 10 million Canadians in Ontario and another 45 million in the U.S.


Protecting electrical utilities from hackers is a concern. (CBC)
There are more than 3,000 utility companies in the U.S. and they range in size from large utilities with decent cybersecurity teams to small firms with fewer than 50,000 customers who don't have the full set of resources to combat modern sophisticated cyber threats.

And that's with our present level of technology. As we embrace smart grid, the challenge in defending our electrical system will grow. 

It's one thing to defend our current centralized power plants and distribution, it's another to defend the future smart grid. 

Why is smart grid such an issue? 
The first risk comes from so-called smart meters  these are the next generation power meters that would be attached to homes and businesses. Unlike today's meters, which function to measure electric and aren't networked, these new devices are networked computers that can send and receive information from the utility. 

The ideal purpose is to optimize energy usages and energy supply planning, making sure the utility has just enough power to meet current and peak demand and providing ever more accurate forecasts.

Future benefits, including being able to access energy stored in every home to help balance the power grid load, taking from homes that need less and turning your home (or your connected future electric or hybrid vehicle) into a giant battery. 

For-profit energy companies love the idea of smart meters because they have another feature  they can remotely turn your power off if you're behind in payments without the expense of sending a crew out to your home or business.

But if these devices provide that capability, how do we ensure that a malicious person or software doesn't gain this same power?

Even worse than temporarily disabling the power, what if the smart devices are corrupted (accidentally or on purpose), when they fail? Will the power still flow or will it stop, causing a potentially larger impact than any storm outage we've ever seen?

The next major issue aside from the smart meters, is all the so called smart devices or internet of things devices in a home.

What happens if tens of thousands of New Brunswick refrigerators that are all internet-connected in the future all start drawing maximum power in an age where we've so closely analyzed supply and demand that we don't have the spare plants to spin up to meet the sudden and unexpected spike? 

Or what if all these smart devices, which home users are expected to patch (but don't) are used to successfully attack the smart meters attached to the home and its devices? 

How is New Brunswick handling this?
The good news is we have some of North America's top minds in cybersecurity in NB Power, and we have some of the world's leaders in smart grid technology doing research in our province.

I know NB Power is keenly aware of cyber risk, and it treats cybersecurity as an important management issue, which is a fantastic place to start. 

But keeping our grid safe involves all of us, so we all need to understand the issues and the risks. Our politicians and media need to ask the right questions so that we can know we're getting the most out of the new technologies and approaches but also appropriately managing our risks. 

Should we slow down smart grid? 
The short answer is no.

Smart grid and smart devices have tremendous benefits when it comes to helping us optimize energy supply and demand and for making our lives convenient, but we need to ask the right questions and demand the right kind of resiliency from device manufactures and energy utilities.

As we've now seen with hacking cars and hacking health care, we can't (and absolutely shouldn't) assume this has all been thought out and is 100 per cent secure and redundant. 

One key question our legislators should be asking is whether the smart meters we want to put in New Brunswick will fail open or closed in the event of a software issue, hack or device failure.

Preferably, we'd like it so that the smart components if they fail would revert to a traditional ""dumb"" power meter that could still deliver energy to a home or business. 


What is the province doing to protect the hacking of its electrical utilities, asks columnist David Shipley. (Jason Turnbull/CBC)
Another key question for legislators and regulators and utilities is how they will secure smart devices from tampering, monitor the network of these devices constantly for any oddities, and patch them on a timely basis when bugs or vulnerabilities are found, so that we reduce the risk as much as possible.

And we also need new cybersecurity standards for smart devices and the internet of things, requiring manufacturers to fix defects in a timely fashion and clearly informing customers of their responsibilities to protect devices/patch devices to prevent their abuse. 

We shouldn't say no to the promise and benefits of smart grid, but we need to be clear about the risks and to be clear about how we are going to manage them. 

Otherwise, our smart grid might feel like a super dumb idea when we're all shivering in the cold because our power got hacked.",1/1/2015,sindh govt decides to cut public transport fares by 7pc kti rej,business
"Town estimates 40 per cent of its residents experience some form of 'energy poverty'

Bridgewater has applied for the $5-million prize to try to reduce ""energy poverty."" (The Canadian Press)
Bridgewater is the only Nova Scotia community to make the short list for the federal government's Smart Cities Challenge for innovative solutions.

Federal Infrastructure Minster Amarjeet Sohi released the names of 20 communities to make the cut at a national conference of municipalities in Halifax Friday morning.

Bridgewater has applied for the $5-million prize to try to reduce ""energy poverty."" In its pitch, the town describes energy poverty as when a household spends more than 10 per cent of its income on energy to heat and power a home, as well as fuel needed for commuting. 

Energy poverty: the hidden technology gap
The town estimates 40 per cent of its residents experience some form of energy poverty and, with energy prices on the rise, the town predicts those numbers will increase. 

The town proposes reducing the effects of energy poverty in the community through implementing clean energy initiatives. 


Making the short list means the town will receive $250,000 to further develop its proposal.

More than 200 communities across the country submitted ideas in three categories: $5 million, $10 million and $50 million.

Halifax applied for the $50-million prize but wasn't selected.

The only other proposal from Atlantic Canada to make the short list is a joint submission from St. Mary's First Nation and Fredericton in the $10-million category.

Finalists for the funding will be announced next spring.",1/2/2015,asia stocks up in new year trad,business
"New initiative paves the way for Ottawa to become a 'smart city'

(iStock)
Whether you're thrilled or frustrated by your internet connection, the City of Ottawa wants to hear about it.

Delivered in partnership with the Canadian Internet Registration Authority, a new online portal allows Ottawa residents to put their internet connection through its paces. The tool is available on the CIRA website here. 

At the click of a button, residents will receive information about the speed and performance of their connection, allowing them to compare results from across the city.

Becoming a 'smart city'
Matt Eason, an economic development officer with the City of Ottawa, said the city is considering several ""smart city"" initiatives, from internet-enabled traffic management systems and street lights, to amplified 5G signals for mobile devices.

As Eason put it, the test results will help the city increase the number of services available online, including parking and other permits.

""At a basic level, you'd be looking at things like services that right now you have to physically go to a client service centre to access,"" he said. ""We'll be looking to move a lot of those online. There will be a number of opportunities to provide services in a mobile-friendly way, beyond just kind of your standard desktop website.""


The City of Ottawa says results from the Internet performance test will help improve delivery of city services online, including on mobile devices. (Mike Segar/Reuters)
Rural connectivity also a concern
The city is also hoping the test results will provide a better understanding of broadband connectivity in Ottawa's rural communities.

""Obviously, there are some areas where connectivity is faster, easier  there are more provider choices,"" Eason said. ""But again, because of the unique nature of our geography, there are more rural areas where there may not be the same diversity of choice.""

While results from the project will be shared with the city, residents on the outskirts of the city can also test their connection using the online portal.

Jim Pine is the co-lead of the Eastern Ontario Regional Network, an organization that aims to improve broadband access and speeds across 13 counties surrounding the City of Ottawa proper.

""In rural areas, it was pretty bad in spots. We've made some big improvements through the project, but we always know that there's more to do,"" Pine said. ""The demand for bandwidth over the internet, it grows exponentially  as you probably know  whether you're a rural customer or whether you live in an urban city like Ottawa.""

'The demand for bandwidth over the internet , it grows exponentially.""
- Jim Pine, co-lead of the Eastern Ontario Regional Network
Between 2010 and 2015, the Eastern Ontario Regional Network invested $175 million in infrastructure to improve access for roughly 425,000 homes and businesses across Eastern Ontario.

The Eastern Ontario Regional Network has not yet decided whether to pursue a similar test with the Canadian Internet Registration Authority, but Pine said they continue to work to improve the quality of service in the area.

""We're thinking about how best do that,"" he said. ""We've talked to residents and businesses around the region about what kind of services they're getting. We regularly work with the private sector partners who helped us build the network.""

Last December, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission declared broadband internet a basic telecommunications service, ordering providers across the country to boost service and speeds in rural and isolated areas.

Internet service providers are now expected to offer download speeds of at least 50 megabits (Mbps) and upload speeds of at least 10 Mbps.",1/5/2015,hong kong stocks open 0.66 percent lower,business
"Pilot project at four locations in Edmonton to start in October

Electric autonomous shuttles will be piloted on closed-off streets in Calgary and Edmonton in October and November. (PWT)
0 comments
Edmontonians and visitors may have to pinch themselves next month when they see a shuttle go by  with no driver.

The city will test electric autonomous shuttles at four closed-off sites in Edmonton in a two-month pilot project starting in October.

The public will be able to take one-kilometre, six- to seven-minute rides and tell the city what they think.

Coun. Andrew Knack said the pilot project brings home the reality of smart technology.

""We talk about the word autonomous vehicles or self-driving vehicles,"" Knack said. ""It's one thing to talk about it, it's something entirely different to actually go into that vehicle, sit in it and realize, 'Wow, this is already here.' ""

The ELA (Electric Automation) pilot is a partnership with Pacific Western Transportation, the company that runs the Red Arrow buses. It's also being tested in Calgary.

The company pitched the idea to the city in April.

ELA is made by EasyMile, an autonomous vehicle company that has supplied shuttles in more than 20 countries across Asia, the Middle East, North America and Europe.

Stephanie McCabe, manager of the city's corporate strategy branch, said the shuttles will use technology from the University of Alberta's Active Aurora project.

""Vehicle technology that speaks to infrastructure,"" McCabe said. ""You can optimize the transportation system when you have vehicles speaking to infrastructure, and vehicles speaking to each other."" 

Coun. Andrew Knack has lobbied for smart technology at traffic signals. (CBC)
The shuttles can hold about 12 people. Though completely automated, each will have an attendant on board.

The pilot is being conducted in the early winter to see how the technology works in a cold climate.

Later this month, the city will reveal the locations where the shuttles will be tested.

The pilot project will cost about $30,000.

Smart Transportation Action Plan
It is one component of the city's new smart transportation action plan, a framework to prepare for more autonomous vehicles, smart traffic signals and electric charging stations.

City council's urban planning committee adopted the plan at a meeting Tuesday.


""It's a transformational time,"" Coun. Michael Walters said. ""A long time ago, we changed from the horse and buggy to the car, and over time cars have become more sophisticated.""

Knack said companies like GM have announced they will start releasing driverless fleets in cities by 2020.

""For a lot of people it sounds [like], 'What world are we talking about?'' he joked. ""These are what the companies are investing billions of dollars in, and will likely be operating in less than 10 years.""

Personal rapid transport
Smart technology allows vehicles to communicate with each other. 

Manager of corporate strategy, Stephanie McCabe, said the city will announce the locations of the shuttles later this month. (CBC)
""They can join up, sort of to the size of a bus, and move the amount of people as what a standard bus would have,"" Knack said.

He said the shuttles are able to break off into separate pods people can ride home or to work.

""The actual vehicle then starts breaking off into its independent shuttles.""

Traditional transit stations will also likely change, Knack said.

Mobility as a service
Instead of selling individual driverless vehicles, Knack expects automotive companies will start branding their products under a service model.

""Everything we do as consumers now is typically service based. We subscribe to Netflix, we subscribe to Spotify, we subscribe to all these services.""  

All major vehicle manufacturers are planning to use subscription services ""that can be as efficient if not more than driving our own personal vehicle,"" he said.  

The city is working with ATCO to install up to 10 curbside electric charging stations by March 2019.

ATCO is using a grant from Natural Resources Canada, said Mike Mellross, the city's program manager for energy transition.

The city is also in preliminary talks with EPCOR to own and operate the sites.

Mellross said electric vehicles haven't caught on in Edmonton the way they have in other cities, such as Vancouver. 

""The penetration rate of those vehicles is quite low right now,"" Mellross said. 

There are about 400 electric vehicles registered in Edmonton, he said. 

Some people say access to charging stations in the city has stopped them from buying electric. Mellross said the city hopes to change that.

He said Edmonton should consider a user-pay system for charging stations.

""It's definitely a trend in the automotive industry right now to electrify their fleet.""

Electric vehicles can typically go 150 kilometres on one charge, depending on how much heat is being used. Batteries range from company to company.

Some stores already have charging stations in their parking lots.

""I see nothing wrong with the status quo.""
Coun. Jon Dziadyk voted against adopting the transportation plan, calling it ""virtue signalling.""

""This seems to be more about our climate goals than moving people,"" he said.

Dziadyk said the city should focus on getting more people to take public transit and the LRT.

""I see nothing wrong with the status quo.""

Dziadyk was the only dissenting voice at the meeting on the smart transportation action plan.  

Coun. Scott McKeen said it was dangerous for council as a whole to send mixed messages to administration about the future transportation plan, which will inevitably include smart technology.

""I think this work is critical,"" he said. ""They will do to transportation what the internet did to communications.""

Walters said the plan is not only about climate but congestion and movement of goods and services, calling the report thoughtful and prudent.

""I disagree vehemently in the assertion that this is virtue signalling,"" he said.

Walters said taxpayers are not on the hook for electric charging stations or the plan.

He suggested the city will end up saving a lot of money in the future by getting away from fluctuating fuel costs.

""Be prepared for the future,"" Walters said to the committee.

The city's corporate strategy branch will ask council at upcoming budget talks to approve salaries for one to three staff positions. The employees will keep up with emerging technologies related to the smart transportation plan.",1/6/2015,asian stocks sink euro near nine year ,business
"Adaptive signals analyse patterns, make real-time adjustments to smooth traffic flow

About 400 intersections in Edmonton are slated for basic upgrades. (CBC)
4 comments
Edmonton intersections are destined to be smarter, likely starting next year after city council approves the next four-year budget in September.

The city's operations branch told the urban planning committee Tuesday that it plans to install smart technology, also called adaptive signals, at intersections already slated for upgrades.

Coun. Andrew Knack has been a proponent of the technology and said he's pleased to hear the city has a plan.

""We know there's a need now,"" Knack said Tuesday. ""We know there are intersections across the city and more importantly corridors across the city where this technology would start benefiting us right away.""

Currently, conventional signals are pre-programmed to adjust to different times of the day such as rush hour, but they can't adjust to actual traffic flow and vehicle volume. 


Coun. Andrew Knack says smart signals can collect data on traffic volume and flow on a daily basis, helping the city plan better for infrastructure. (CBC)
""These [smart signals] are very different in that it is counting how many vehicles are coming through a particular intersection, how many are approaching the next intersection, and then it is able to adjust on the fly based on that data that's coming in.""

The signals will be collecting data the city can use in future planning, Knack added.

""It's ridiculous as a city that we do vehicle counts typically once every two years on a roadway,"" he said. ""This will give you daily traffic counts as well. You can also use that data to help inform future infrastructure work.""

About 400 traffic signals around the city need upgrades at an estimated cost of $200,000 each. It's not clear how much more it would cost to include the smart technology.

Councillors on Tuesday also passed a motion to look at traffic corridors where they can test the technology as a connected system.

City staff will report back Sept. 11 with options for a synchronized corridor.

One congested area that comes to mind for Knack is 149th Street, while Coun. Michael Walters identified 111th Street as another troublesome stretch.

Knack sees the financial and environmental win behind the smart signals. He said it will benefit pedestrians because the system will give them the green light when no vehicles are heading through an intersection.

Councillors have other options to consider for the future.

Warren Sheydwasser, president of Soltare, a company that develops transportation technology, showed up at the meeting to pitch his product  technology that would enable traffic signals to ""hear"" fire trucks and ambulances and change accordingly.

""Create a green path for emergency vehicles to navigate through an intersection as opposed to having to run red lights,"" Sheydwasser explained. 

Sheydwasser has contacted automotive companies with a proposal to have his technology installed in individual vehicles. 


Warren Sheydwasser wants to partner with the city on a pilot project to test his technology, which he says can detect emergency vehicles. (CBC)
""This really is must-have technology for the autonomous vehicles,"" he said.

Sheydwasser is hoping the city will eventually partner with him to do a pilot with his technology.

The city's operations branch is scheduled to present a Smart Transportation Action Plan to City Council in September along with requests for funding in the 2019-2022 budget for smart signals.",1/6/2015,us oil prices slip below 50 a barr,business
"Professor says it's a marriage between smart vehicles and smart infrastructure

The University of Alberta is developing technology that allows vehicles to talk to each other through an integrated traffic system controlled by the city. (CBC)
The University of Alberta and the City of Edmonton are lending new meaning to smart cars.

Researchers from the university's engineering department are working on a pilot technology called ""connected vehicles,"" aimed at creating a safer, quicker and more efficient commute.

With the integrated system, vehicles will use wireless internet to share information, or ""talk"" with each other, through a central communications hub.

Lead researcher Tony Qiu, an associate professor of transportation engineering at the U of A, describes it as a ""marriage"" between the ""smart vehicle and the smart infrastructure to improve our daily life."" 

Dr. Tony Qiu of the University of Alberta's engineering department has been working on the Active Aurora project for five years. (CBC)
Vehicles with the technology will be able to inform each other about road conditions, how long a green light will last or when pedestrians are about to cross the road.

Qiu explained that the Chinese government aims to have these smart cars make up 50 per cent of its new vehicles by 2020. Smart vehicles, as opposed to self-driving vehicles, can collect information from inside and outside the vehicle and process data in real time.

Aalyssa Atley, spokesperson for the university's Active Aurora project, said they've placed sensors along the roadside on the Anthony Henday, Whitemud Drive and 23rd Avenue. 

These pick up on the activity around them and transmit the information to a central hub. 

Jerry Zhang, left, a civil engineering co-op student, works on the connected vehicle technology. Aalyssa Atley, right, is the communications coordinator with the project. (CBC)
""There's a lot of interest right now in this kind of technology that makes the driver more aware of the environment around them,"" Atley said.

She said the the technology will improve safety and travel times by regulating traffic and allowing people to get to their destinations more quickly.

""A lot of car manufacturers are starting to put this technology in the vehicles.""

Coun. Andrew Knack said the technology will enhance what he's expecting will be artificial intelligence installed at intersections around the city. 

""I think it's critically important to being prepared as a city for the future of transportation,"" Knack said.

Knack has asked city staff to compile a report on how the signals are operating, how they're designed to adapt to a change in traffic patterns, and compare information with new traffic signal infrastructure.

He points to Pittsburgh as a prime example of where artificial intelligence is used to apply real-time information to what's happening on the road.

There, technology has reduced wait times by 40 per cent, travel times by 20 per cent and, in turn, emissions by about 20 per cent, Knack said. 

""The goal is to ensure people and goods are moving as efficiently as possible in the city,"" Knack said. 

Cell phones may be a stepping stone to making sure the technology is available to the most drivers.

The team has developed an app for people who don't have newer vehicles.

Industry players
""We're seeing how quickly companies are advancing self-driving vehicles, connected vehicle technology,"" Knack said.

General Motors, he said, aims to operate a fleet of self-driving vehicles by 2019.

Knack thinks it's important to get a head start on shaping policy and preparing to develop the city's 10-year transportation plan. 

Sensors set up along Anthony Henday, Whitemud Drive and 23rd Avenue send signals to connected vehicles that allow them to share road information. (CBC)
""The new ways that people are going to move will dramatically impact how we grow as a city."" 

The federal government has invested $1.3 million to the Active Aurora project, with other levels of government and private investors contributing $2.36 million.

Most recently, the Active Aurora project got a funding boost of $934,000 from Western Economic Diversification Canada to explore clean technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The next phase of the project will be to recruit about 100 volunteers to drive around with the technology to test it on a larger scale.",1/7/2015,oil hits new 5.5 year lows as saudis defend ,business

As Edmonton redesigns its bus system and paves the path for more LRT lines, two companies are asking the city to include autonomous transit in Edmonton's future network.

Pacific Western Group of Companies, which operates the Red Arrow bus service and has 25 transit contracts across the country, wants to partner with the city to run self-driving shuttles.

The company's director of sales and business development, John Stepovy, told the urban planning committee Tuesday they will run an autonomous vehicle in Calgary this September to shuttle people between the zoo and Telus Spark science museum.

Stepovy hopes to do something similar in Edmonton during the CFL's Grey Cup this November. They've also reached out to Fort Edmonton Park, he said.

I think this is coming a lot quicker than people think
- Coun. Andrew Knack
""We believe that Edmonton's got a great opportunity to be a leader in this space,"" Stepovy said. ""There's technology out there that can enhance the system.""

City staff said they're willing to work with the company to figure out a small test site this year.

Maglev-based technology 
Edmonton-based Magnovate Transportation is pitching an even more state-of-the-art project.

Dan Corns, president and CEO, said his company uses existing Maglev train technology, which runs in Germany and China.

Short for magnetic levitation, Maglev trains are considered faster, more efficient, less expensive and more environmentally friendly than traditional trains, he said.

Instead of a train, Magnovate proposes light-weight vehicles that would require their own track in ""seamless, on-demand networks, where you're not running into traffic jams.""

""What we're looking to do is to create something revolutionary,"" Corns said Tuesday. 

Magnovate Transportation is developing on-demand autonomous network system it hopes Edmonton will invest in within four to five years. (Magnovate Transportation)
He said the company is developing prototypes and wants to partner with the city for an urban pilot project, suggesting a network from downtown Edmonton to the airport.
""You have lighter vehicles that show up every 30 seconds to a minute,"" he said. ""With express vehicles going directly to your destination without stopping at each station along the way.""

Dan Corns, president and CEO of Magnovate Transportation, is pitching an urban pilot project with the city, suggesting a network from downtown Edmonton to the airport. (CBC)
The company is setting up North America's first Maglev-based system in Toronto, starting with a one-kilometre track in the next six to eight months, stretching to a five-km trip. 

Corns estimates a short system could be up and running in Edmonton in four or five years. 

He said the first step is for the city to look at the company's third-party cost study and technology to see if they're interested. If they are, he'd then look for sites for a pilot project and ask the city to help lobby the federal government for funding.

Changing labour field
Coun. Andrew Knack was curious how autonomous vehicles may impact companies and jobs.

Stepovy said positions may have to adjust to the new industry but he believes people won't lose jobs, at least not right away.

""We don't envision this being totally unmanned, unoccupied,"" he said.

Red Arrow, which runs several buses a day from Edmonton to Calgary and Fort McMurray, for example, would still require an attendant.


""If that becomes an autonomous shuttle going up and down the highway, rather than having a driver, you're going to have a customer service attendant on board,"" he said. ""So you're still going to help people with their luggage, you're going to answer questions.""

Knack brought the subject to the committee meeting.

""I think this is coming a lot quicker than people think,"" Knack said. ""In the way we move goods throughout the city, in the way we move people throughout the city.

""It would be nice to be the ones who are at the front of this.""

The committee agreed that Edmonton should be ready to test autonomous vehicles by January 2019 at the latest.

Tesla crash
Despite recent news that the Tesla vehicle involved in a fatal crash last week in California was operating on autopilot, Knack said the city must move forward.  

Knack said the technology is not going to be 100-per-cent perfect but is meant to reduce serious collisions.

""We often forget about the fact that there are thousands of deaths on Canadian roads every year in motor vehicle collisions,"" he said. ""It's become almost so common that we don't report on every traffic fatality across this country.""

Right now, he said testing in Alberta requires a ""perfectly enclosed roadway network,"" which makes it difficult to test anywhere.

The province is expected to release its updated framework by June, after which the city can formulate a more specific outline for automated vehicle testing.",1/9/2015,bullish kse jumps over 33000 psychological barrier,business
"Underdeveloped waterfront ideal location to start building smart city

Toronto could be Google's first digital city. (David Donnelly/CBC)
Google has its sights set on piloting its vision for the smart city of the future in Canada's largest urban centre. But its reasons for picking Toronto are not necessarily the ones we might first assume.

Alphabet, Google's parent company, is eyeing Toronto for its foray into digital city-building. At first glance, it makes perfect sense. After all, Toronto is Canada's largest city and Canada is having a moment right now. The city has a lot going for it: it's a growing metropolis, a multicultural epicentre, and a new tech hotbed.

Making Canada's capital a 'smart city'
Your smartphone might help you build a better city
But to understand the real reason Google is eyeing Toronto, it's important to look at their intent and take them at their word. Google says it wants to use technology to ""fix"" cities. Before news of the Toronto plans leaked, the company was said to be eyeing Detroit, a city of another era, now devastated by the fallout of a crumbling auto industry.

Through that lens, the allure of Toronto as a venue for piloting a vision shifts slightly. One of the greatest appeals for Google isn't what Toronto has built, but what it hasn't. Namely, the city's under-developed industrial waterfront. Even if you've been to the city, you may not know that this part of the city even exists; with few businesses and fewer attractions, there's little to bring people to the area, despite its proximity to both the city centre and to stretches of Lake Ontario beach front. In other words, it is a 12-acre ghost town, inside of a growing, urban metropolis.


Toronto's underdeveloped waterfront could be a perfect location for Google to begin developing a smart city. (CBC)
""Toronto has all of the conditions of being an innovative city that Google would be looking for,"" says Christopher De Sousa, the Director of Ryerson University's School of Urban and Regional Planning, adding that this ""could be the catalytic spark that the city needs to get them to act on this inactive and underdeveloped area once and for all. There has been disagreement about what to do with the area for a hundred years, whether it is residential or business-driven  a smart city would bring both employment and housing  and do it in a futuristic innovative pilot model.""

The premise of Google's smart city is appealing. A city built from the ground up promises not just the convenience that comes with new technologies, but also the potential of environmental sustainability, health benefits, and even affordability of housing. The vision entails high-speed internet access and free wifi across the hub, self-driving cars, ride-sharing, and sensors throughout that automate the way people engage with their surroundings, making everything from street lights to air conditioning smarter and more efficient.

'From the internet up'
If anyone can do it, it's Google. Having started as a search engine, they quickly expanded to help us communicate, navigate and even work. For the past year, they have been brainstorming what their version of this smart city might look like. And based on how quickly they've been able to saturate the online world, once they have the get-go from a city, this futuristic hub could become a reality pretty quickly. After all, the component parts aren't revolutionary: self-driving cars are already hitting the market, communities are opting for their own Fibre networks, and Amazon has taken care of some of the heavy lifting by testing out how sensors and data can change the retail experience with fully automated cashierless stores. Google just needs to bring it all together.

The internet giant's plan is to build this new city ""from the internet up."" In that context, Toronto is the ideal place to begin, because it presents the perfect opportunity to showcase what the company is capable of without ruffling any feathers or raising real red flags.

""You're not displacing low-income residents; you're not displacing high density jobs,"" says De Sousa.

Should their proposal be successful, they'd have buy-in from the city, which is currently seeking bids to revitalize the waterfront area, which would suggest an openness to adapting city bylaws to help this vision come to fruition; in fact, Google's vision goes beyond brick and mortar or digital bells and whistles, with hopes of reimagining zoning to make urban living more affordable. Surely, when it comes to setting themselves up for success as they venture into city planning, they couldn't have dreamed of anything more perfect than a sprawling no-man's land, just minutes away from the downtown airport and the financial district?

But imagining this city-building venture in other Canadian cities, like Montreal, Ottawa, or Vancouver, brings to light some of its challenges, and some of the ethical issues we'll need to take into account sooner than later, should a pilot like this be successful and scale across the country with the same rapid growth that made the internet ubiquitous in the first place.

Challenges in other cities
Theoretically, if this demo comes to fruition, any of those major Canadian cities could be next. ""Fixing"" a city is one thing when you have under-developed urban land to work with. But as De Sousa points out, it's a whole different scenario when it entails changing the city's existing infrastructure.

""Many big Canadian cities are under such development pressure already that to try to integrate this concept into existing neighbourhoods would be difficult; you have to consider long time residents, gentrification concerns, the displacement of high density jobs and the limitations of existing infrastructure. You don't have that when you're working with an under-developed area of land."" 

Bordered by water, Vancouver may not have the capacity for urban sprawl to allow for this kind of ""from the internet up"" approach without demolishing existing neighbourhoods. While the eventual smart hub might have a lot of appeal, bringing it to life in an already crowded urban centre would require displacing residents and local businesses. 


Vancouver doesn't have the advantage of being underdeveloped the way Toronto does. (Christer Waara/CBC)
And Montreal? Well, that's tricky for the same reason that building a city of the future in a European capital like Paris or Rome might be, where there is historic architecture built according to the plans of another era. Installing a strong fibre optic network is a lot more complicated when the city's architecture is protected by historical preservation efforts.

And that's the point: to truly build the city of the future from the ground up necessitates that we demolish the city of the past. And that requires some thoughtful considerations about the trade-offs being made, questions that conveniently won't need to be asked if Google gets lucky and wins the bid for Toronto's waterfront.",1/12/2015,oil falls further in asian trad,business

A southeastern Ontario city says it is teaming up with Bell Canada to implement new technology that will monitor certain municipal operations in what it's calling a ""Smart City"" program.

The project will collect and organize data from internet-connected items to help the city of Kingston, Ont., keep track of things like energy use.

Making Canada's capital a 'smart city'
Do you have a smart idea worth $10M? The City of Fredericton wants you
In San Diego, a lamppost can tell you where to park
A joint statement from Kingston and Bell says the project will help the city make better informed decisions on matters like municipal operations and infrastructure.

Kiosks, more data
Kingston says the first two parts of its Smart City program will roll out this spring.

The city will introduce digital kiosks that provide Wi-Fi access, real-time event updates and charging services, as well as 911 emergency buttons among other features.

The city will also begin closely monitoring energy data, which it says will help reduce carbon emissions and meet municipal environmental targets.

It says it will also help the city better co-ordinate maintenance.

Kingston and Bell note that the federal government announced $300 million in funding for Smart Cities over 11 years in its 2017 budget.

""This partnership with Bell will create cutting-edge technology for us and put Kingston on the map as being one of the most innovative cities in Canada,"" said Kingston Mayor Bryan Paterson in a statement.

"How can municipalities use the technology at residents' fingertips to make life easier?

'Ten years ago, what you were able to do with your flip phone and what you're able to do with your phone today are like night and day, and could you have predicted that 10 years ago?' asks the City of Ottawa's John Smit. (Mike Segar/Reuters)
A number of civic, academic and business leaders will gather today to envision how Ottawa and Gatineau can become ""smart cities"" of the future.

Transit riders can already track when buses will arrive and drivers can add money to parking meters via their phones.

Driverless cars could be tested on the streets of Kanata this summer.

How do you position yourself to take advantage of the new opportunities that are coming through the interconnections?
- John Smit, City of Ottawa
But things are moving quickly.

Data analytics, cybersecurity and the internet of things are transforming business, and cities are grappling with how to use those interconnections to help their residents, according to John Smit, acting director of economic development for the City of Ottawa.

Smit will be speaking at the conference put on by Library and Archives Canada and the University of Ottawa. The mayor of Gatineau and CEO of the National Capital Commission, as well as researchers and business executives, will all weigh in on what the future could look like.

""Ten years ago what you were able to do with your flip phone and what you're able to do with your phone today are like night and day, and could you have predicted that 10 years ago?"" Smit said.

Sensors and 'smart' devices
In the same way microwaves were a new convenience a generation ago, connected technologies should make life easier for people, said Campbell Patterson, a Kingston-based consultant who will also speak at Monday's event.

Patterson sees a future where technology allows people to receive health care, education, and do work without leaving home, which will mean less wear and tear on roads and fewer greenhouse gas emissions.

Smart technologies are already allowing cities to gather data to manage everything from garbage, to water, to traffic, and help them save money and time, he said.

For instance, in Barcelona, Spain, the municipality has sensors in garbage bins so that trucks only empty them when needed, he said. 

""The prediction is there will be 50 billion sensors deployed [worldwide] by 2020,"" said Patterson.

For instance, autonomous vehicles could lead cities to install sensors on roads, Smit suggested.

Broadband is this century's railway: consultant
But in such an interconnected world, Patterson said a city that doesn't invest in broadband service stands to leave its residents and businesses behind.

""A municipality needs to be thinking about equitable access to the internet, and broadband infrastructure to support that, in the same way they think about investments in roads, water and electricity systems, that these are fundamental to the well-being of the community,"" he said.

And municipalities shouldn't leave it up to private telecommunications companies to beef up networks when they see fit, Patterson said.

""As long as downtown Toronto has better connectivity than everyone else, then the people who live there have a competitive advantage over everyone else,"" he said.

At the City of Ottawa, Smit knows consistent broadband access for everyone is one piece of the puzzle.

Staff are figuring out where to focus the municipality's efforts to make Ottawa a ""smart city,"" and how to tie that in with the steps being taken by Hydro Ottawa and the economic development agency Invest Ottawa.

That overarching strategy is expected to be presented to councillors this spring or summer, Smit said.",1/14/2015,oil extends losses as world bank cuts growth for,business
"Halfway through a year-long consultation, little is known about how Toronto's 1st 'smart' district will work

Cars are parked in the Port Lands, located along Toronto's eastern waterfront, where the Alphabet-owned Sidewalk Labs is developing a plan for a new technology-driven neighbourhood. (Mark Blinch/Reuters)

Sidewalk Labs  which has proposed the construction of an ambitious, technology-driven neighbourhood on Toronto's eastern waterfront  held its second public roundtable on Thursday night. It was an opportunity, in part, to address concerns about data and privacy. 

But the company, which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet and bills itself as an ""urban innovation organization,"" still offered little in the way of specifics about what exactly it has planned, and those details are not expected until summer at the earliest.

Sidewalk Labs has partnered with Waterfront Toronto, a government agency, on a smart-cities project along the eastern waterfront of Lake Ontario in Toronto's downtown. The project, dubbed Quayside, will transform a 12-acre parcel of L-shaped land into a test bed for smart city technology  one that could include everything from intelligent traffic cameras to garbage cans and recycling bins that keep track of when and how often they're used. 

But questions about privacy have emerged. Chief among them are concerns about the extent of the data that will be collected, whom it might be shared with, whether the data will be stored in Canada and the possibility that even anonymized data could still be linked back to individuals.


Sidewalk Labs has proposed the redevelopment of what's currently a stretch of parking lots and former industrial space along Toronto's eastern waterfront. But its plan  still in development  will need a green light from the city. (Sidewalk Labs)
Commitment to protect privacy but few details
Thursday night, Sidewalk Labs offered little in the way of answers to those concerns, only abstract commitments to collect only as much data as is necessary and to put people's rights and needs first in principle. 

Representatives from the New York-based company acknowledged frustrations with the lack of detail.

Halfway through a year-long consultation period, the company insists it is on track, and that a lack of specifics is to be expected at this stage. Because no other smart cities exist on the scale that Sidewalk Labs has imagined, the company says it's still figuring things out and taking the time to get things right.

Alyssa Harvey Dawson, the company's legal counsel, told the crowd that the lack of specifics about how exactly the company will protect residents' privacy was ""not because we don't care, but because we care so much.""

Sidewalk Labs will present its final plan to the city by the end of the year  and the company says that citizens will get more specifics before then.

'Meaningful consent' and no data sold to advertisers
In the mean time, the company has taken a number of recent steps that suggest it is trying to take privacy concerns seriously. A third-party group will be advising the company on data use  though it will only offer recommendations that won't be binding.

And earlier this week, the company released its ""Responsible Data Use Policy Framework""  not the policy itself, but an outline of principles and commitments that the company says will inform the policy's eventual creation, which will evolve over time. 

""One of the challenges that collectively we face in this process is thinking about privacy and responsible data use in the abstract,"" Micah Lasher, the company's head of policy and communications, told CBC News.

""It's very hard to come up with policies that govern a project as complicated as this without concrete examples of how they would apply.""


Without specifics on what Sidewalk Labs has planned for the site, pictured here, it has been difficult for outsiders to know how the privacy principles laid out at Thursday's meeting will be applied in practice. (Mark Blinch/Reuters)
The document contains a list broad principles that few would take issue with  such as how Sidewalk Labs will seek ""meaningful consent"" before it collects personal information; will be as transparent as possible about how data will be used; and won't sell personal information to third parties or make it available for advertising purposes (what will happen to non-personally identifiable information is less clear).

But while it is useful to have such commitments written out, they say nothing about Sidewalk Labs' actual plans for Quayside  the specific site to which these principles will have to be applied. 

Thursday's meeting could have been a chance to explore the applications of these principles further. Instead, the company merely reiterated the policy framework it had already released before turning the floor over to the audience for questions.

Rit Aggarwala, the company's head of urban systems, deflected when asked about how the company plans to make money off the neighbourhood.

""It's so early days we haven't really thought about the specifics of the business model yet,"" Aggarwala told the audience during the second of two Q&A sessions.

Ditto for how the company plans to handle the sharing of data with police and government agencies. Lasher, the company's policy head, couldn't say one way or another whether the company has met with Toronto police to discuss how they might benefit from the data collected in the Quayside project.

""We have lots of people that are engaged with lots of different government agencies,"" Lasher said. ""I couldn't tell you offhand.""

Specifics still to come
Without specifics, it's difficult  for citizens but also advocacy groups, lawyers, academics and journalists  to meaningfully consider how the principles Sidewalk Labs laid out Thursday are applied in practice.

Sidewalk Labs says that citizens will hear more about its plans before the public consultation process is through  and before a final plan is delivered to the city toward the end of the year. But there is a legitimate concern that mere weeks or months may not be enough time for citizens to engage with what is being proposed  and, importantly, for Sidewalk Labs to take feedback into account.


A mixed use path for runners and cyclists passes through the proposed development site for Sidewalk Labs' smart neighbourhood project, which could include intelligent traffic lights that adapt to the flow of traffic and heated paths that deter the build-up of snow in winter. (Mark Blinch/Reuters)
Facebook's recent troubles around data privacy provide a timely, cautionary tale of the potential disconnect between principle and practice. Facebook has long painted itself as a benevolent company that, like Sidewalk Labs, puts the privacy of user data first  and yet the Cambridge Analytica scandal undermined that image.

Similarly, Facebook's mission to help its users forge more meaningful connections seems to be contradicted by some of the activities the platform has facilitated. The social platform has been used to spread hateful messages that some say have helped fuel violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.

That and other examples illustrate why it's difficult to have discussions about the impact of a product  let alone a neighbourhood  on principles alone.

Facebook's principles  even if envisioned with the best of intentions  have frequently been at odds with how Facebook has functioned in practice.

""We didn't take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is, and that was a huge mistake,"" Zuckerberg has said in response to criticism.

And in the absence of more information from Sidewalk Labs, it's difficult to say whether it's taken a broad enough view of its responsibility, either.",1/14/2015,tokyo stocks open 0.74 percent lower,business
"Critics hungry for details about the futuristic Quayside neighbourhood proposal will have to wait

Critics still have few details about what Quayside, a tech-focused, futuristic community on Toronto's waterfront, will actually look like. This sketch was released when the project was announced some six months ago. (Sidewalk Labs)
?The public will have to wait until late July to see ""initial sketches"" of a plan for a proposed high-tech community in the city, while a more detailed proposal is set to be released in October, Sidewalk Labs and Waterfront Toronto said Thursday at a consultation meeting that offered scant new information.

And it won't be until sometime in the new year that citizens will see the full picture being envisioned by Sidewalk Labs, which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet. 

In October, Waterfront Toronto announced it had chosen Sidewalk Labs to present a plan to design a brand new area of the city from scratch, with innovative technologies and infrastructure that's expected to include roads designed for driverless cars.

Bianca Wylie, co-founder of Tech Reset Canada, said the new timetables given for releasing real details about the project will leave the public with little time to assess them.

""They're going to have to have more public meetings or there's no legitimacy,"" Wylie said. ""You cannot assess something until you see it in its technical detail.""

While the public was originally promised a year of ""extensive community and stakeholder consultation,"" that could be extended, said Kristina Verner, vice president of innovation, sustainability and prosperity for Waterfront Toronto.

""That one year is not written in stone, it could be a little longer than a year, the reality is we need to take as much time as it's going to take to make it right,"" she said.

""It's not a race to the finish, it's a race to getting it right and, if it takes a little bit longer than what had been articulated ahead of time, there's a commitment on both sides to make sure that time is taken to get the community's voice to be heard and actually answer the questions that come forward as a part of the process.""

'They're very slick' 
Molly Sauter said she came away from Thursday's event feeling no more informed about the process and called the presentation ""an exercise in salesmanship.""

A group of companies, including tech giants like Microsoft, is opening a new hub devoted to turning Toronto into a what it calls a ""smart city.""

The facility will focus on developing high-tech products and services that the companies hope will improve the quality of life for people in big cities.

Toronto's new 'smart' traffic lights will sense congestion and adjust themselves
Led by IBI Group, an architectural and engineering company that's already involved in major projects like the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, the ""Smart City Sandbox"" will also assist with bringing smart-city technologies to market.

So what will Torontonians see?

The organization is already thinking of traffic lights that sense congestion and adjust themselves accordingly, a mobile app to report potholes and batteries large enough to store energy at night and reduce demand on the city's power grid during peak times.

""The sandbox is a platform for different organizations to come together to address some of the challenges that are faced by urban environments,"" IBI Group CEO Scott Stewart told CBC Toronto.

Stewart hopes to support ""new, innovative solutions that touch on the planning, design, implementation and operation of cities.""

The announcement is the latest in a series of recent moves by organizations in Toronto that make it a major centre for research and development of smart-city technology and urban planning expertise.

The University of Toronto recently created the School of Cities, for example, which brings together academic experts from different fields to address the problems facing Toronto and other cities around the world. Additionally, Toronto may soon have a futuristic, technology-driven neighbourhood created by Sidewalk Labs, which is owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet.

Approximately 55 per cent of people in the world live in urban areas, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. That number is expected to rise to 68 per cent by 2050.

City planners and technology companies have developed the concept of a smart city as one way to manage the burdens of urbanization.

A city sandbox
While major companies are leading the way on the Smart City Sandbox, the hub will look for ideas from smaller companies, too.

An application process will open in September to small- and medium-sized businesses, entrepreneurs and start-up companies worldwide. The Ontario Centres of Excellence will help to identify prospective candidates.

Each cohort will focus on a specific urban theme  health, mobility, energy, living, among others  and participants will have three to six months to work on their ideas.

Companies that are accepted will receive workspace at IBI Group's headquarters in Toronto. The corporate partners will provide help in the form of software, consulting services and data to help participants develop their ideas.

One of the most attractive parts, says Stewart, is the access to the machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities of Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing platform.

Participants will also have the opportunity to present their innovations to venture capital funds at regular presentations every six weeks.

Stewart said IBI Group has already put aside $500,000 to invest in the project. He estimates the total cost to run the incubator at around $3 million per year.

A holistic approach to urban development
Chris De Souza, director of the School of Urban and Regional Planning at Ryerson University, says Toronto's openness to new ideas makes it fertile ground for technology companies to experiment.

""There has historically been a lot of interest in this city in trying out different types of development,"" said De Souza.

De Souza pointed to the sustainable design requirements of the Green Standard and the public-private partnership that implemented the Regent Park Revitalization Plan as examples of Toronto's embrace of innovative urban planning.

"If you moved away from London today and came back in a decade, what changes would you notice?

London, Ontario skyline photo taken on June 1, 2017. David Donnelly/CBC (David Donnelly/CBC)
If you moved away from London today and came back in a decade, what changes would you notice?

We asked London's top city planner about the projects that will transform London. Here's what John Fleming told us:

Urban Design
When planning major projects, approving developments and thinking about neighbourhoods, Fleming said his team focuses on designing the urban landscape with people in mind.

""All of our public realm spaces need to be beautiful, and we need to make a city that people want to live in, to enhance our quality of life,"" Fleming said.

""It doesn't mean that we have the same street treatment, the same tree treatment, in all of our spaces, it means we have flexibility to create the type of city people want to live in and that can attract talent.""

The River
The forks of the Thames River are the starting point for London, and will be transformed by the Back to the River project, a partnership between the city and the London Community Foundation.

The ambitious project will see five kilometres along the river downtown redeveloped and turned into destination for Londoners.

A 5 km stretch at the Forks of the Thames could undergo a major redesing (provided: City of London )
""We're lucky we have a river running through our urban core,"" Fleming said.

The $5 million project will include a giant ribbon-shaped boardwalk built atop the Thames downtown. 

""We're trying to create more excitement and a more dynamic space for the community to consider as a prime gathering place,"" Fleming said.

The SoHo (South of Horton) neighbourhood is also included in the plans and will completely transform the current grounds of the former South Street hospital.

""We're planting the seeds of a new urban neighbourhood, with a promenade along the river, and possibly a link from the foot of Colborne Street across the river to Watson Park.""

Downtown
The Dundas Place flex street will turn London's major core street into an attraction, Fleming predicted, attracting people to not only visit downtown but to also move there.

A rendering of the flex street planned for Dundas (City of London )
""Downtown is our image. As with the river, what we really need to think about is our economic labour force and attracting workers. They're looking for great cities to work in and live in and the flex street will be a wonderful addition to making the downtown more attractive,"" Fleming said.

Students will fill the downtown as the former Kingsmill building fills up with classes, he said, and the flex street will see restaurants and cafes ""spill out on to the sidewalk"" when on-street parking is removed at certain hours.

""We hope it will be a new living room for London,"" Fleming said. ""The programing for the flex street will be crucial, the concerts and the entertainment will draw people.""

Transportation
Let's assume the bus rapid transit plan doesn't get tossed out the window after the municipal election. 

The new transit plan will get people downtown faster, but it's more than just a way to move people, Fleming said. 

""It also helps us to grow inward and upward, makes us think about agricultural land and environmental areas and not always hopping into the car,"" he said.

Proposed Bus Rapid Transit lanes on Wellington Road at Commissioners Road. (Supplied photo)
""It's a way to encourage those mid-rise and high-rise forms of development that might not occur otherwise.""

The plan is expected to be fully operational by 2028. 

But the city is also working on connecting parts of the Thames Valley Parkway, the city's multi-use pathway system, to allow for easier commuting for cyclists, Fleming said. Current gaps north of the Western University gates, in the south end by Kiwanis Park and Pottersburg Creek, and in the west end are also expected to be filled. 

""We're also working to put up protected bike lanes to get a safer context for biking on the roads, to make commuting another way of getting around that is a viable option,"" Fleming said. 

Smart City
Politicians have asked city planners to look at how London could become a ""smart city."" 

That could mean anything from taking our data and using it to improve the morning commute or when recycling is being picked up. 

""We have to be collaborative. The city has to work with institutions, with businesses, with NGOs, to provide an environment for innovation to occur,"" Fleming said. ""It will be a big part of the city of the future. All cities are starting to think about this."" 

Stratford, for example, has become a testing ground for autonomous vehicles. A Toronto neighbourhood might become a testing ground for Google, a new community where technology will be impeded into daily life. 

""It's something to keep an eye on,"" Fleming said. 

London 2028
Those coming back to the city in a decade will see a vibrant downtown, a community using its core for commercial purposes and more residents downtown. 

""I hope that people would see a transportation system that is significantly evolved and a really progressive, smart city, with technology integrated into everything we do, with a great pulse of economic activity going on,"" Fleming said. ",1/19/2015,brent crude steady around 50,business
"MONTREAL  As Montreal plays host to the Smart City Expo on March 25-27, the co-founder of the Intelligent Community Forum is offering some tips on how to get our city engaged in creating a sustainable future.

Lou Zacharilla is the co-founder of the New York City-based Intelligent Community Forum, which works to revitalize communities for the 21st century.

Zacharilla spelled out the five criteria that make an intelligent community:

1. New infrastructure: are we supporting broadband and information technology?

2. Workforce: are we creating a knowledge-based workforce?

3. Innovation: particularly at the local government level, are we facilitating these changes?

4. Digital inclusion: are libraries, schools, hospitals and other community organizations hooked up?

5. Advocacy: how well do we tell our stories and market them to the rest of the world?

The Smart City Expo is an international conference on the city of the future, bringing together public administrators, international experts and firms specialized in developing urban policies for smarter cities.

Montreal hit the smart 21 list in 2014, but still lags behind Toronto, which was voted Intelligent Community of the Year last year.

What makes a smart city?
The best smart cities focus on making their communities work better by metering and monitoring water, electricity and roads to make everything run cheaper, faster and more efficiently.

What makes an intelligent community?
Intelligent communities go one step further than smart cities by focusing on re-energizing the grassroots movements that reinvigorate a city.

Intelligent communities are cities that take a closer look at their problems and tackle them head on to address the most important natural resource  human brain power.

The idea is to harness the skills of community leaders on all levels, including economic, social and cultural.",1/20/2015,report presented to pm holds ogra responsible for fuel crisi,business
"Transportation staff with the City of Edmonton have committed to begin shifting traffic signals to new smart technology.

Members of city councils urban planning committee were told on Tuesday that this September, council will get a report that spells out a set of test corridors.

As well, when the next four-year budget is adopted this fall, plans will be to begin shifting over to new signal lights for those times when the old ones are replaced.

Thats now going to be the standard, which is that they will build that, said an encouraged Councillor Andrew Knack who has been pitching this technology. So the next four-year budget, if they were going to spend X amount of dollars for replacement of traffic signals, itll now be X amount plus the incremental cost to make sure theyre fully smart, AI- (artificial intelligence) enabled traffic signals.

Watch below: On Feb. 27, 2018, Quinn Ohler filed this report about Edmonton looking at ways to move traffic more efficiently through trouble spots on city roads using artificial intelligence.


Councillors were told that there would be double-digit savings in travel time, idling time at intersections, and as a result, reductions in emissions.

Youre moving efficiently through, so to me, this is a financial win for the city because it helps people move efficiently  thats good for business, thats good for people and its an environmental win, Knack told reporters.

Base figures will need revising based on the amount of work that will be done at any given time, however, the initial range is from $100,000 for those intersections that would already be compatible, to $200,000 for older locations.

The most expensive upgrades would be $400,000 at some intersections with ageing signal poles and fixtures, according to the report that councillors debated.

In these cases, administration would co-ordinate with other capital rehabilitation projects to optimize savings.

Deputy city manager Gord Cebryk told councillors that the technology is at a point where it can be a benefit to Edmontons traffic operations.

It is taking real-time data and adjusting the signals to accommodate that real-time data  whether its pedestrian volumes or vehicle volumes  and it is basically providing a level of service that is more aligned with what the actual demand is.

Knack added that it can do traffic counts on a daily basis instead of once every couple of years.

We know that theres a need now, he said, We know that theres intersections across the city, and more importantly, corridors across the city where this technology would start benefiting us right away.

The technology has already been tested in Pittsburgh and Toronto. Knack said even if Edmonton sees just a five-per cent improvement, it would be worth it.",1/21/2015,notification issued for reduction in electricity charges for karachi nepr,business
"Digital initiatives could soon be hitting Ottawas streets with the goal of turning the capital into a smart city, according to a report going before the citys Finance and Economic Development Committee next week.

Smart city strategies have been gaining momentum worldwide, says the report prepared by city staff, and Ottawa is well-suited to build on its existing infrastructure in developing a connected city.

While smart cities have been a topic of conversation for years, advancements in the Internet of Things and analysts forecasts for the future of the field have brought the concept closer to reality. According to the report, an estimated 50 billion devices will be connected to the internet by 2050.

In this not-so-distant future, autonomous vehicles will need to communicate with smart infrastructure, and a connected home could call a plumber on its own if the basement pipes spring a leak. The city sees these developments as an opportunity to improve service delivery for residents and accelerate Ottawas digital economy.

If the report is approved by FEDCO, the next step would see an action plan commissioned, ordering priorities and detailing how suggested initiatives might be implemented.

Below are a few of the initiatives suggested by the report. Empowering knowledge-based businesses, integrated municipal services and higher connectivity speeds are all facets of staffs vision for a smarter Ottawa.

Connected city
Smart cities are quite literally better connected through broadband networks. The report outlines Ottawas strengths in this sector, as the city has an already-extensive fibre optic infrastructure and accessible 4G mobile connectivity in most areas.

It also suggests building on the work of numerous telecom companies and the CENGN, where a great deal of research is already going towards the development of 5G connectivity commercializations.

The report recommends piloting state-of-the-art services in newly-built communities by partnering with developers. New residential developments could integrate technologies connected to the internet that monitor service delivery, collect data and send analytics back to the city to refine those services.

To better connect citizens, the report also suggests expanding access to public Wi-Fi, minimum connectivity standards and improving access to low-cost broadband options.

Smart economy
Smart cities need smart workers. To this end, the report puts a spotlight on talent, and mentions Invest Ottawas Work in Ottawa campaign as a driver for building knowledge-based businesses.

Invest Ottawas Bayview Yards home may see an expansion under the smart citys plan as well. In addition to the often-discussed second phase of the Innovation Centre development, which would see an office tower rise from the space, the report also mentions a potential innovation district at Bayview Yards. The area would be a mixed-use housing, retail and office space focusing on housing startups and entrepreneurs in a compact geographic area.

Another aspect of Ottawas smart economy could focus on precision agriculture in order to engage the citys agricultural sector and meet rising demand for tools that help to maximize farmers yields.

The report also indicates support for Ottawa as an autonomous vehicle testbed, a movement that has generated significant momentum in recent months.

Innovative government
The third piece of Ottawas smart city plan revolves around improving the processes of government. Sample initiatives include a mobile-first strategy, improving access to the citys open data and generating better feedback through service delivery analytics.

The city would also investigate how artificial intelligence and machine learning could improve and scale city operations.

The report suggests one method of improving services would be better engaging the citys knowledge-based businesses. This could be achieved by refining procurement models, the report says, where private sector partners suggest improvements rather than responding to city requests.

Ottawa has already made a series of investments in smart infrastructure for the city, according to the report. Examples include OC Transpos real-time service updates, an automated water meter reading process and a partnership with Rogers and Ericsson on an IoT connected water solution to maintain the quality of the citys watershed.",1/22/2015,asia stocks mostly higher ahead of ecb meeting,business
"It can be a major source of frustration in Edmonton: waiting for the bus and not knowing when it will arrive. That is now a thing of the past for Edmonton Transit. As Vinesh Pratap reports, all buses can now be tracked through your smartphone or a computer.

The City of Edmonton is showing off its Smart Bus technology now that all of its 928 buses are equipped with it, completing the $18-million project.

On Tuesday afternoon, ETS branch manager Eddie Robar demonstrated how Smart Bus technology works.

One of the primary features is that riders can track their bus in real time on every route in the city before waiting at any one of the 7,300 bus stops in Edmonton. It also provides riders with automated stop announcements, automated vehicle monitoring, and GPS location services.

A full bus fleet with Smart Bus technology is an incredible accomplishment for ETS, Robar said.

It improves the reliability, predictability and accessibility of transit service. The collection of data also assists transit planners when designing how service is delivered to citizens.

Wi-Fi now available at all LRT stations on Edmontons Capital Line

The city said ETS surveys have found an internationally used third-party app called Transit is popular with riders. The smartphone app has real-time schedules, departure alarms and system maps.

The smart bus technology was launched in Edmonton in January 2011 after city council approved $3.4 million to start the project. During the first phase, 45 buses were equipped with the technology. During the next several years, the city purchased new buses that were equipped with smart bus features.

Edmonton Transit going more high-tech

In 2014, ETS started to retrofit its existing fleet of buses with funding approved by council. At the end of 2014, city council approved additional funding to add the technology to another 500 buses.

In December 2015, council approved funding to install smart bus technology to the remaining 125 buses.",1/23/2015,ecc approves export of 1.2 million tons of ,business
"TORONTO  Mandatory smart meters are dumb, Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak said Monday in promising to scrap the program he called just another tax.

Smart meters allow people to shift electricity-consuming chores to off-peak times when power rates are lower, thereby saving money and easing the overall load on the system.

But Hudak said too many families simply end up paying the higher rates because they cant shift their power-usage habits.

What I hear from families is theyre nothing more than tax machines, Hudak said of the smart meters.

Not every family can get up late at night to do the laundry. Not every family can have all the kids showered and fed and ready for school before 7 a.m. when the higher rates kick in.

With smart meters, or time-of-use pricing, consumers pay significantly more  as much as 150 per cent more  for power used at higher-demand times.

The Liberal government maintains the meters are a valuable conservation tool in that they force people to think about the power they use.

Smoothing out the demand also keeps overall hydro costs down because it lessens demand at peak times that drive prices up and strains the system, they say.

During the six months ending Oct. 31, for example, the on-peak rate of 10.5 cents a kilowatt-hour is charged between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.

By contrast, off-peak price  between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. and on weekends  is just 5.9 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Hudak did not say why he considers after seven in the evening to be late at night.

Nor would he say what power would end up costing if the system was scrapped but said it would be a flat-rate set as an average of the other rates.

The Liberals pointed out that the average would mean a cut of 20 per cent on peak rates, but a 44 per cent jump over off-peak times when, they said, most residential usage happens.

Hudaks failure to understand this basic fact will result in families paying the price of his ill-conceived policy, the Liberals said.

NDP Andrea Horwath refused to say if she would scrap the smart meters, despite saying they have been ineffective in promoting conservation.

A New Democrat government would encourage energy-saving measures by diverting money that would otherwise go into new nuclear power plants to grants, loans and rebates for consumers, she said.

People could use the funds to do things like replace old windows or inefficient furnaces, Horwath said.

Hudak said people who like the idea of time-based power can opt in if they want, but said no one should be forced to have a smart meter.

No one should be gouged for daring to live what he called a normal lifestyle, he said

"MONTREAL  The city of Montreal is experimenting with a new way to clear snow off the streets.

City officials want to implement a new technology to make snow-removal more efficient and less expensive.

The $6.7 million plan will add GPS and electronic readers to around 200 snow clearing vehicles so officials can measure exactly how long it takes to clear a street, as well as judge how much snow is removed.

The new system will also install measuring devices on dump trucks belonging to subcontractors that work for the city to record their weight, capacity and ownership.

When these trucks arrive at the dump sites, operators will be able to calculate how much snow the truck is carrying and where it comes from.

Notices will also be set up through social media so residents know in advance when plows are rolling down their streets.

In the past, Montreals snow-clearing system has long been criticized for being expensive and inefficient.

This is because each of the 19 boroughs was responsible for its own operations and the city had no control over which boroughs fell behind in their snow removal.

There are nine boroughs slated to be the first to implement the new snow-clearing technology.

These are Cte-des-NeigesNotre-Dame-de-Grce, the Sud-Ouest, PlateauMont-Royal, RosemontLa-Petite-Patrie, AhuntsicCartierville, Rivire-des-PrairiesPointe-aux-Trembles, MercierHochelaga-Maisonneuve, VilleraySt-MichelParc-Extension and Ville-Marie.

"Video:  Engineers from the University of Toronto say theyve combined artificial intelligence with game theory to come up with a smart solution to traffic lights that just dont seem to get it right. Christina Stevens explains.

We all know the feeling, stuck at what feels like a never ending traffic light in the midst of rush hour, or sitting at a red light late at night when there is no one going the other way.

A pair of Toronto engineers think they have a solution. The University of Toronto professor and Phd student have come up with a traffic light which uses artificial intelligence to speed things up.

A virtual test on 60 Toronto intersections found the system, dubbed MARLIN, could cut wait times by up to 40 per cent. Both academics and municipalities are taking notice.

Samah El-Tantawy said she was inspired to work on the project by seeing the impact of traffic jams in Toronto and her hometown, Cairo, Egypt.

Currently most traffic lights are controlled by timers or they use sensors hooked up to a centralized system. El-Tantawys concept uses cameras and computers in each individual intersection to instantly read traffic data in all directions and adjust the length of the green light accordingly.

It takes the appropriate action by adjusting the times in real time to minimize the delay in the intersection while also coordinating with the intersections in the neighbourhood, she said, adding it employs something known as game theory concept.

Picture a hockey team, each player knows where the other is and is constantly making decisions based not just on what is best for them, but what is best for the rest of the team. They know when and where to pass. That is how this works. Like humans, MARLIN learns. The more it learns, the better it works.

The traffic light keeps adjusting itself, its timing every second, every second there is a new decision, then observing the impact of that on traffic. Am I making things better or making things worse? If I am making things better the queue lines are reducing by how much? said Professor Baher Abdulhai, head of the Intelligent Transportation Systems Centre at U of T.

He explained this is all kept in memory, in a mental map, until MARLIN gets to the point where it knows exactly what to do on a second-by-second basis. Thats when you get the 40 per cent decrease in time at traffic lights and Abdulhai said that translates into a reduction of about 25 per cent off of your total commute time.

Why is this so important? It is about a lot more than driver frustration. Several studies have found congestion takes a toll on the economy, the environment and even our health.

The C.D. Howe Institute has taken a hard look at the economic toll. One common estimate is that traffic jams in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton area cost the Canadian economy about $6 billion per year. However the C.D. Howe Institute found it could be even pricier than that, estimating additional costs of between $1.5 billion and $5 billion a year.

Study author Benjamin Dachis points out the problem is much larger than just traffic lights, and says Substantial infrastructure and public transit investments have to be made and other solutions like tolls considered.

Abdulhai and El-Tantawy dont dispute that, but say improving the time spent at intersections is still a factor. El-Tantawy has won two prestigious, international academic awards for MARLIN (one from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Intelligent Transportation Systems Society, the other from the Institute of Operations Research and Management Sciences).

El-Tantawy and Abdulhai are currently in talks with a number of municipalities about rolling out pilot projects in hopes of keeping traffic rolling right along.

"TORONTO  Close to 5,500 smart meters in Ontario will be replaced because of a risk they could catch fire.

The Eletrical Safety Authority is directing local utilities to replace the smart meters as a preventative step after a review of problems associated with smart meters in Saskatchewan.

The specific meter is the iConA Generation 3.2 remote disconnect meter manufactured by Sensus. The ESAs review found the model was susceptible to failure when there was a build of water and contaminants in the meter.

The probability of a serious safety incident in Ontario is low, said David Collie, ESAs president and CEO. Were issuing our order as a proactive, preventative step. Even if the risk is low its better to react now and remove that risk altogether.

SaskPower, Saskatchewans power authority, recalled some smart meters from homes in that province due to the risk of fire last year. More than 100,000 meters had to be removed as a result of nine fires associated with the meters.

The Ontario Energy Board said in August, 2014 the same model is not used in Ontario but 36 of the provinces 77 utilities use other models by the same manufacturer, Sensus Corp.

There have been no serious safety events reported in Ontario.

None of the smart meters which have to be replaced were in Toronto.

The recall is the latest controversy to spring from Ontarios smart meter program. The provinces Auditor General reported in December the program cost nearly $1.9 billion  double the original estimated amount.

"Scientists in one of Canadas snowiest cities will help a sunny Caribbean island switch to a green energy grid, leaving fossil fuels in its wake.

University of New Brunswick researchers have received $4.3 million from Ottawa and Emera Inc.  the parent company of Barbados Light & Power Co.  to develop potentially breakthrough renewable energy technology.

The five-year project, led by electrical and computer engineering professor Liuchen Chang, will be based at the universitys smart-grid research lab in Fredericton.

At this stage, were getting the data from Barbados and doing the research and modelling, Chang said Wednesday. In the next stage, we are going to bring the technologies to Barbados and work with Emera on the installation and testing in the field.

With roughly 120,000 power customers and a grid capacity of 240 megawatts, the Lesser Antilles island is the right size to test green technology in a small-scale, energy-hungry market.

What we want to do is use the island as a demonstration project and showcase these technologies, said Chris Huskilson, Emera president and CEO.

The reason were talking about Barbados is because its an economy that actually has the opportunity to go 100 per cent renewable more rapidly than most other places. It has a mandate from the government to do that, and also a tremendous solar resource and a very good wind resource.

In 2010, the islands electricity generation was 100 per cent oil-fired, which has since been reduced by about 20 per cent. The country has pledged to transition to a fully renewable energy grid by 2045.

However, one of the long-standing issues with renewable energy is its intermittent nature  the sun has to be shining or wind blowing for energy to be produced.

Its one of the challenges Chang and his UNB team plan to address through electric vehicle storage systems, shaping customer demand and encouraging a proliferation of small-scale generation.

Were focused on  battery storage and electrical vehicles, small generators such as rooftop (photovoltaic) systems and customer load, Chang said, adding that the smart-grid technologies can enable an electricity grid to shift to 100 per cent renewable energy without being crippled by the intermittent nature of renewables.

A focus of the Barbados project is so-called distributed energy resources, which includes small-scale renewable projects like rooftop solar or wind systems.

About three-quarters of the solar energy that is being produced today is from rooftops, so there will be a combination of larger scale and distributed, Huskilson said. Part of what the smart-grid technology being developed at UNB will allow us to do is to control those rooftop devices and add storage and the ability to actually have them support the grid in a much better way.

Chang said rooftop solar and wind may be small in size but you aggregate them together and they are huge.

Barbados Light and Power plans to offer incentives to customers to plug in their electric vehicles as a cost-saving measure.

The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency is investing $2.8 million through the Atlantic Innovation Fund while the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada has contributed $82,100. Emera has put $1.4 million towards this project.

Huskilson said the smart-grid technology being developed at UNB can be deployed anywhere in the world, including in Atlantic Canada.",1/27/2015,petrol price expected to be slashed by rs 10 per litr,business
"Imagine if you could fold up your tablet or smartphone. As Allison Vuchnich reports, UBC researchers have invented a flexible sensor that has the ability to detect touch while being stretched and bent.

Imagine being able to fold up your tablet or smart phone and put it in your purse or pocket.

Foldable touchscreens and robotic skins could soon be part of a new reality, thanks to a new flexible sensor developed by a team of researchers at the University of British Columbia.

Using a conductive gel between two layers of silicon, theyve created a flexible sensor that can also sense a hovering finger as well as touch, including swiping and tapping.

 There are other stretchable and bendable sensors. What really makes us unique is that we can stretch and bend and detect the finger while doing that, said UBC electrical and computer engineering professor John Madden.

The sensor could be wrapped or folded around the body, offering new possibilities in the world of interactive consumer products and environments.

An interactive drug patch, for example, could allow someone to control their dosage using touch. That data could then be collected and sent to a device, such a computer or smartphone.

In a hospital setting or care facilities, the sensors could be placed under carpets to detect falls, or under bedsheets to prevent bedsores.

Mirza Sarwar, an electrical and computer engineering PhD student at UBC, said they have high hopes for this technology.

Without the bulkiness of current electronics, Sarwar said wearables of the future will feel more like an extension of our bodies.

You [could] have it on your arm then you would actually feel as if its an extension of you. Its an extension of your skin, so you can interact with it much more seamlessly. And it wouldnt feel like a bulky additional device, he said.

The UBC team says the prototype, which was outlined in Science Advances, measures 5 cm x 5 cm but could be easily scaled up. Besides its flexibility, the sensor is made with affordable and widely available materials  gel and silicone. Madden estimates it could cost as little as a dollar per square metre.

"As anyone who ever rode Torontos King Street streetcar before 2017 can tell you, speed is of the essence.

But speed was one thing notably absent from North Americas busiest surface transit route, at least until the King Street pilot project, which gives priority to transit vehicles over cars, was implemented last November.

Jesse Coleman, who leads the City of Torontos Big Data Innovation Team, says that after monitoring the abysmally slow traffic conditions along Torontos third busiest transit artery, after the citys two main subway lines, something had to be done. After trying moves such as prohibiting left turns at certain intersections, the King Street pilot project, which allows vehicles to travel only one city block before they are required to turn off the busy artery, was born.

We have the data that shows [the streetcar] was moving essentially at five kilometres an hour so people were literally like, Why would I get on that thing? I might as well just walk,  he says. So something new had to be tried.

While data has played an important part in the strategy and deployment of the King Street pilot, its application will have many varied uses, including those yet to be discovered, in building the cities of tomorrow. Mr. Coleman and other experts elaborated on that potential at The Globe and Mails Innovation Summit, held on Wednesday in Toronto.

Using a Bluetooth reader, Mr. Colemans team was able to collect travel times downtown at every intersection, picking up a signal from each cars in-dash Bluetooth unit and identifying its unique media access control (MAC) address. That process was also applied to tracing the MAC addresses of smartphones belonging to pedestrians and cyclists, to discover whether the King Street pilot is resulting in more people using the road for walking and riding.

It also gave the city insight into how the shutdown of much of King Street to regular traffic was affecting travel times on other roads in the downtown core.

Probably counter to a lot of peoples expectations is that traffic for cars has not really been affected by the pilot on parallel streets in downtown, Mr. Coleman said. We have a lot of hard data that shows that travel times are up and down plus or minus a minute from Bathurst [Street] to Jarvis [Street] on all the parallel streets downtown.

One of the major concerns about this large-scale harvesting of data in any smart city is privacy and the possibility that individuals might be tracked.

Beth Coleman, associate professor of experimental digital media at the University of Waterloo, says it is vital that cities make the consumer, or the person receiving the benefits that come from pulling data, a collaborator or participant in the process. That way they will be able to understand the greater good that comes from gathering the data.

If we can move toward that, then I think we will be doing better, and we will have an actually smarter city, she said.

WE Charity, one of Canadas foremost youth organizations, certainly leaned heavily on data when it was planning its new global learning centre, which opened at the intersection of Queen and Parliament streets in Toronto last year.

The former furniture store was more than 100 years old, but a $15-million retrofit dragged it into the present day and beyond.

As a result, the 43,000-square-foot interior is now home to 40 different microclimates in which the temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide levels are constantly adjusted to provide the best working conditions for occupants. WE also installed a daylight harvesting system that saved around 25 per cent of its energy costs on lighting.

We really wanted to be future forward, says Jeff McLeod, WEs director of the global learning centre. We really wanted to set ourselves up so that we could be a little future-proof, because who knows what 20 or 30 years is going to look like?

Thats the pivotal question that so many city planners and developers are desperate to answer.

At First Gulf, which is leading the redevelopment of the former Unilever soap factory site on the east side of the Don River in downtown Toronto, technology will be relied upon to create a more comfortable, energy efficient and sustainable environment for customers and tenants.

While that will extend to HVAC, lighting and other such systems, the rise of autonomous vehicles adds another wrinkle to the smart cities of the future. Uber announced on Thursday that it would invest more than $200-million in Toronto over the next five years to open an engineering office and to expand its self-driving car centre.

How that all plays out will have a direct impact on how smart cities are built, with First Gulf planning on making its East Harbour district at least 80 per cent non-car, and possibly more depending on the implementation of autonomous vehicles.

What do you do with a parking garage in the era of autonomous vehicles? asked David Gerofsky, chief executive officer at First Gulf. There are places like [Londons] Canary Wharf that have turned their parking garages into retail, but whats going to happen to retail in the next 20 years?

The possible introduction of Googles tech-reliant Sidewalk Toronto district in the citys docklands might provide an interesting blueprint for smart cities of the future, but Mr. Gerofsky is quick to point out that while his company is happy to use data, First Gulf is not in the data business.

"Drivers on Highway 401 near Pickering, Ont., can be forgiven for thinking that a new art installation has opened up at the citys busy GO commuter train station.

At night, the stations recently completed, 250-metre pedestrian bridge  which crosses 14 lanes of traffic to connect to the Pickering Town Centre mall  is a dazzling sight. Awash in 297 undulating blue and purple lights, its an oasis of colour splashed across an otherwise drab environment.

Its also the latest example of a trend sweeping cities around the world: the replacement of dull, single-purpose outdoor lights with dynamic LEDs that promise a host of benefits, swirling colours among them.

It takes a public space that was really boring and makes it very dynamic, says Venkat Venkataramanan, director of scientific operations of the Impact Centre at the University of Toronto and head of the Smart Sustainable Lighting Network. It contributes to the overall vibrancy and happiness of the city.

Canadian municipalities are full-in on the trend, with buildings, bridges and landmark attractions in Toronto, Montreal and Calgary  such as the Bloor Viaduct, Autoroute 20 and the Calgary Tower, respectively  adding or converting to LEDs over recent years.

Creating something interesting out of nothing is one of the key drivers, made possible by relatively new lighting technology.

LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, are capable of changing colour because they are tiny  just a few millimetres in size  and can be rapidly switched on and off by computerized microcontrollers.

A grouping of three red, green and blue lights can therefore quickly simulate a wide range of colours in programmed sequences. Deployed in large numbers, LEDs can be used to dynamically transform exteriors and mark special occasions.

The CN Tower in Toronto, for example, can glow red and white on Canada Day or in rainbow colours during the citys annual Pride festival.

LEDs dont necessarily have to change colours, but their programmability, better quality and efficiency are also driving municipalities to replace existing mundane street lighting nevertheless.

LEDs generally cost more upfront than traditional fluorescent and halogen bulbs, but they use an estimated 20 to 40 per cent less energy. They also last longer  up to 10 or 20 years, compared to just two to four years for older types. Cities are finding those potential cost savings appealing, especially given that many are growing and having to add more lighting over time.

Montreal, for example, expects to cut its lighting energy bill by 35 per cent and its maintenance costs by 55 per cent after its current conversion of 132,000 street lights is complete. Calgary, which completed a conversion of 80,000 street lights last year, expects $5-million in annual electricity cost savings.

The psychological effects of converting to exterior LEDs, meanwhile, are still being studied, but evidence of positive trends is also emerging.

Los Angeles, for example, attributed a 10.5-per-cent drop in street crime to better visibility resulting from its conversion of 140,000 LED street lights since 2013, according to a report published last year by the World Council on City Data.

The same report also expects clearer visibility on roads to result in a 30-per-cent decrease in night-time car accidents.

If the lighting quality is better, people make fewer mistakes and they misbehave less. Thats what you see happening, says Harry Verhaar, head of global public and government affairs at Signify, a unit of Philips Lighting, which sponsored the report. People go out more often, they feel safer.

Concerns have arisen, however, that LED lights can also result in negative effects if incorrectly deployed. The American Medical Association, for one, warned in 2016 that blue-rich LED lights  which appear as harsh white to the human eye  can actually decrease visibility and public safety.

Municipalities that have converted, or are in the process of doing so, have had to adjust their plans as a result.

Montreal, for example, initially planned to deploy LEDs with a temperature rating of 4,000 Kelvin, but ultimately decided on a warmer 3,000K. The city of Davis, Calif., also recently had to replace its 4,800K LED street lights with warmer 2,700K options at a cost of US$350,000 after residents complained.

Cities that have been slower to convert are thus benefiting from the mistakes made by early adopters. Toronto, for example, is looking to switch hundreds of thousands of street lights over the next few years, but planners are aware that theyll need to avoid overly bright LEDs.

The city last year issued a best practices report that suggests any conversion will need to be dark sky compliant, or keeping with standards issued by the International Dark Sky Association. Such rules would require LED street lights to be on only when needed, to point down and be fully shielded, and to minimize the amount of blue light emitted.

We do still need to be careful with how theyre designed, keeping in mind issues such as glare and light trespass, says Kelly Snow, an environmental policy planner for the City of Toronto who authored the report. Were learning as we go with these things.

Despite the early issues, lighting experts nevertheless believe that switching to LEDs will result in better cities overall.

Things look brighter, Mr. Venkataramanan says. People are starting to see things differently, more vibrantly.

"Expansive public spaces, roads that can change in colour and use, and buildings that act as open malls are some of the design ideas Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs shared in a public meeting Tuesday evening, as part of the consultation process for its proposed smart city development on Torontos waterfront.

The five-hectare parcel of land known as Quayside, which sits at the end of Parliament Street, will be comprised of a dense collection of mid-rise buildings surrounded by a network of narrow, walkable streets that focus on pedestrian access while barring regular cars, representatives from Sidewalk Labs LLC, a unit of Google Inc. parent Alphabet Inc. explained in a media prebriefing ahead of the meeting on Tuesday.

After months of talks, Sidewalk and Waterfront Toronto, a corporation comprised of three levels of government, released a plan development agreement on July 31, detailing some of the companys plans for its futuristic proposal and naming Sidewalk as the funding and innovation partner. Sidewalk has so far put up a US$50-million investment, some of which is being spent on a series of public consultations and planning.

Waterfront streets will be renamed as places with distinct identities, to act as lively urban connections as well as traffic arteries, Pina Mallozzi, director of design with Waterfront Toronto, said on Tuesday, adding that streets also need to function as a part of the environment. ""Streets are an integral element of our public realm, said Ms. Mallozzi, ahead of the third of four planned public roundtables on the project.

That means that many of the streets within the development will be pedestrian-only, while others only allow bicycles and, in the future, slow-moving autonomous vehicles. As The Globe and Mail reported last week, Sidewalk Labs is testing plans for a unique road surface made up of hexagon-shaped tiles that can change colour and be swapped out to add green spaces or other uses for the street.

But details on how this technology will operate and what kind of data it will need to actually function are still sparce. Sidewalk Labs was unable to give any estimates on potential costs and faces many hurdles before being allowed to develop a multi-use district that could run contrary to local zoning bylaws. Even the companys plans to build timber structures more than six storeys high are not yet approved in Canada.

The development will incorporate the use of a number of sensors that gather complex data about peoples movements, and interactions with the neighborhood, and it is unclear how that data will be handled and protected. This remains a contentious issue among critics like Bianca Wylie, head of the Open Data Institute Toronto, who says that its deeply troubling that the owner of all this data hasnt been established.

The fact that it hasnt been defined is problematic, said Ms. Wylie. Those are things that Waterfront Toronto could have made requirements, and now were sitting in an unknown.

Hundreds of visitors showed up at the public consultation Tuesday night, the third such event since the project was announced in the fall, where an hour-long presentation described some of the design aspects of the Quayside development.

Questions ranged from the availability of public housing  20 per cent of land will be dedicated to affordable housing  to the safety of wood as a building material. Residents also asked about the ability for emergency vehicles to access some of the smaller streets. Sidewalk said all buildings will be accessible to emergency services.

By designing streets without cars, Sidewalk Toronto says its trying to make their streets more livable. Cars will instead be able to access the general area through larger roads on the outer edges of the Quayside development, which will also feature transit thoroughfares. They envision the ground floor of every building as an extension of the public realm. Sketches of the development show buildings with completely open foyers, which will house retail and food facilities, as well as community spaces such as libraries.

Making all of this possible in Torontos four-season climate will involve new technologies like road tiles with sensors that can detect when a person is walking on them and can heat up to melt snow. The open foyers in each building will be automatically shielded by barriers during cold weather, high winds or rain, Sidewalk staff said.

We believe we can actually double Torontos usable outdoor hours and plan to test this in Quayside, said Rit Aggarwala, head of urban systems with Sidewalk Labs.

"A new agreement for Alphabet Inc.s Sidewalk Labs to develop a Toronto neighbourhood has reignited concerns over how the U.S. tech giant will be able to use data generated by Canadians.

Sidewalk has heralded its Quayside neighbourhood proposal as the future of smart, connected cities: a sensor-laden community that would collect data from the citizens living and moving within it to make city living easier, in large part by developing new technologies from that data. But as The Globe and Mail reported in February, because the original agreement had not been made public, few details have been available about how that data would be stored and who would be able to innovate with it.

A new plan development agreement released on Tuesday offers many promises about data stewardship and innovation, but few specific details about its implementation, extending long-running frustrations among Canadian innovators.

As it currently stands, someone experienced in commercialization can drive a truck through the language on IP and data in the new agreement, said Jim Balsillie, the smartphone pioneer who  as the former Research in Motion Ltd. (now known as BlackBerry Ltd.) co-chief executive and chairman  is one of the most prolific commercializers of IP in Canadas history. In an e-mail, he continued, ""Between Google and [Waterfront Toronto], I think we can guess who is more experienced on matters of IP and data.

Data sets about how people live and go about the world are becoming recognized as a new natural resource: huge, untapped potential sources of wealth  for those who have access. Some tech leaders in Canada have become deeply concerned that Sidewalk, a corporate cousin of data-hungry Google, might introduce data structures that would hinder Canadians from accessing data here and innovating with it ahead of American competitors.

The original framework agreement with Sidewalk contained little detail on how Waterfront Toronto  and the citizens represented by the three levels of government that run it  would benefit from any intellectual property derived from the project. The new agreement, on the other hand, says the parties recognize the project could be an economic catalyst for open innovation and promises to explore novel forms of data governance, including an independent trust to manage data generated by the project.

Kurtis McBride, CEO of Kitchener, Ont., traffic-monitoring company Miovision Technologies Inc., raised concerns earlier this year about how projects such as Sidewalks Quayside should use non-proprietary, open-data architecture to allow Canadians to innovate with the data generated there.

The new agreement appears designed to recognize such concerns, suggesting the project will foster the development of global standards for urban digital architectures and structure its data to encourage open innovation.

Mr. McBride said in an interview on Tuesday the new language is directionally promising, but needs more detail, as it leaves open the possibility some proprietary data storage and management would give Alphabet an advantage in innovating with it. (He is now a member of Waterfront Torontos digital strategy advisory panel, but agreed to speak solely in his position as Miovision CEO.)

The sooner they can get out of vagueness into specifics, even if its couched as a draft, a starting point, an idea, the better, Mr. McBride said.

Waterfront Toronto, however, insists the agreement with Sidewalk is deliberately structured to focus on broad principles, not specifics, so that details can be determined over time and not rushed.

It is setting a marker for the relationship between the two as to how intellectual property [rights] will evolve, said Chantal Bernier, the former interim privacy commissioner of Canada and senior counsel with Dentons LLP who is advising Waterfront Toronto on the project. This is a principle-based approach that makes sure that Waterfront Toronto secures its rights in relation to this project.

Sidewalk has said it will not commercialize data generated by the waterfront community, but CEO Dan Doctoroff told The Globe earlier this year the company has not ruled out ultimately licensing the technology developed in Toronto as a way to monetize the project.

While the agreement does say that Waterfront Toronto will seek to ensure that the public is reasonably compensated for the opportunities the project would generate, Ottawa patent prosecutor Natalie Raffoul warned the language has great potential to leave Canadians in the dust.

Nothing in this agreement spells out monetization from our own data, Ms. Raffoul said in an interview. The benefit to Google is going to be enormous.

Among the issues she finds concerning include the lack of concrete language around IP co-ownership.

If Sidewalk Labs' or Googles engineers are the inventors, the ownership defaults to them, unless you have an agreement that states otherwise. If Googles grabbing our data from our smart city and we dont have an agreement in place that we co-own any innovation that comes out of that, the default is Sidewalk Labs owning the innovation from that.""",1/31/2015,finance minister announces five percent increase in gst on pol produ,business
"Jim Balsillie is a former chairman and co-CEO of Research In Motion, where he commercialized Canadian intellectual property in more than 150 countries.

With politicians rushing to show Canadas innovation chops, smart cities have emerged as their new frontier. Most consequential of these is a high-profile agreement between Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Googles parent company Alphabet. A year ago, Canadians were treated to an announcement involving the leaders of all three levels of government gushing and fawning about an enlightened urban partnership with a foreign company whose business model is built exclusively on the principle of mass surveillance.

The most insightful comments during the public announcement came when Eric Schmidt, Googles former executive chair, said they had realized their long-running dream for someone to give us a city and put us in charge. He also thanked Canadian taxpayers for paying, creating and transferring the core artificial-intelligence technology he credits for Alphabets success, making it the worlds third most valuable corporation. The Google parents past and future growth are based on the intellectual property (IP) they own and the data they control.

The 21st-century knowledge-based and data-driven economy is all about IP and data. Smart cities are the new battlefront for big tech because they serve as the most promising hotbed for additional intangible assets that hold the next trillion dollars to add to their market capitalizations. Smart cities rely on IP and data to make the vast array of city sensors more functionally valuable, and when under the control of private interests, an enormous new profit pool. As Sidewalk Labs chief executive Dan Doctoroff said: Were in this business to make money. Sidewalk also wants full autonomy from city regulations so it can build without constraint.

You can only commercialize IP or data when you own or control them. Thats why Sidewalk, as a recent Globe and Mail investigation revealed, is taking control to own all IP on this project. All smart companies know that controlling the IP controls access to the data, even when its shared data. Stunningly, when Waterfront Toronto released its updated agreement, they left the ownership of IP and data unresolved, even though IP experts publicly asserted that ownership of IP must be clarified up front or it defaults to Sidewalk. Securing new monopoly IP rights coupled with the best new data sets creates a systemic market advantage from which companies can inexorably expand.

A privately controlled smart city infrastructure upends traditional models of citizenship because you cannot opt out of a city or a society that practises mass surveillance. Foreign corporate interests tout new technocratic efficiencies while shrewdly occluding their unprecedented power grab. As the renowned technologist Evgeny Morozov said: That the city is also the primary target of big tech is no accident: If these firms succeed in controlling its infrastructure, they need not to worry about much else.

What happens with Torontos waterfront infrastructure will have profound and permanent impacts on the digital rights and prosperity of all Canadians because IP and data  our centurys most valuable extractive resources  spread seamlessly. Data has already been used as a potent tool to manipulate individuals, social relationships and autonomy. Any data collected can be reprocessed and analysed in new ways in the future that are unanticipated at the time of collection and this has major implications for our privacy, prosperity, freedom and democracy.

From the start, this project should have been debated publicly and involved experts in IP and data. Instead, Waterfront Toronto continues to weaponize ambiguity while making irreversible decisions that will have major negative effects on all Canadians. Is this how we want our cities and the future of our country managed?

WATERFRONT TORONTO  A PROFILE IN MISMANAGEMENT
In a recent brief to the federal government, the National Research Council warned that Canada was at risk of becoming a nation of data cows, leaking our most valuable national resource to companies such as Amazon, Google and others. Waterfront was undeterred by such warnings and rushed to create a contract with Sidewalk without any input from city staff. The agreement was so flawed Waterfront Torontos board tried to keep it secret for months while the Toronto City Council got a report making it clear the council didnt know what Waterfront was doing. The unsuspecting public and public office holders were alerted to it by the boards only elected official, city councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong, who said: I know enough about the agreement that I think you would like to know more about the agreement.

The charitable among us would call these approaches incompetent, given that Waterfront has no experience or expertise commercializing either IP or data. The more astute would say this is a pattern of deliberate effort to make sure that Sidewalk comprehensively claims all the project-related IP and systemically extends its control of citizen data. After all, a Waterfront board member recently quit in protest over their relinquishing too much control to Sidewalk.

Sidewalk is currently hosting public consultations on Waterfronts behalf, a curious governance arrangement to say the least. As media outlets including Wired reported: The planning process is being paid for by Google, and Google wont continue funding that process unless government authorities promise theyll reach a final agreement that aligns with Googles interests. Those interests include Sidewalks desire to expand its Toronto experiments beyond the projects 12-acre Quayside plot to adjacent land.

Meanwhile public consultations have been called a masterclass in gaslighting and arrogance because they deliberately avoid addressing citizen concerns about data and IP. For its part, Waterfront struck a committee of digital experts but cynically made their advice non-binding and mandated that they sign aggressive and overreaching confidentiality agreements which compelled resignations from prominent independent experts. It has also engaged a privacy expert who remains silent on the questions of ownership and residency of data, key determinants of privacy. On the issue of data collection and control, Waterfront Toronto is promising meaningful consent  whatever that means. No sooner than these empty declarations were made, an Associated Press investigation revealed that Google tracks users even when they dont consent to being tracked.

SMART CITIZENS DESERVE SMART LEADERSHIP
A year later, we are at a point where a secretive, unelected, publicly funded corporation with no expertise in IP, data or even basic digital rights is in charge of navigating forces of urban privatization, algorithmic control and rule by corporate contract. Civic and data experts have called Waterfronts public engagement a fundamental lack of democratic participation in the process, and in her resignation from the Digital Strategy Advisory Panel on Thursday, Saadia Muzaffar pointed to Waterfront Torontos astounding apathy and utter lack of leadership regarding shaky public trust and social licence. Also this week, The Logic reported that the Ontario Auditor-General is investigating Waterfront Toronto. But if we want Toronto to be truly better governed and to have a more vibrant and prosperous future, we also need investigations into Waterfronts RFP process for Quayside, its governance, its secrets about secrets in public engagements and value for money.

If we are to build viable digital cities for the benefit of Canadian citizens, we will need transparency and accountability between the government and its citizens, not a secret deal between an unelected, rogue public corporation and a foreign multinational in the business of mass surveillance. Waterfronts current approach needs more than a complete overhaul. It requires a restart with a new RFP that accurately frames the urban issues Toronto is trying to resolve and the vision its citizens have for this particular piece of land, their demands for municipal control of data and digital infrastructure and the protection of their digital rights. If this project is to be a model to be exported around the world, as the Prime Minister said it will be, then maybe we can try engaging with Canadian innovators already providing smart cities technologies around the world rather than growing Alphabets bottom line.

Smart cities need to involve experts who protect us from enamoured politicians who continue to give away Canadas most valuable intangible assets to foreign tech giants. As parent company, Alphabet, reminded us at the announcement a year ago, if Canada retained ownership of the taxpayer-funded IP and data we recently transferred to them, we would still have untold billions of dollars available for our cities' infrastructure and services. A sovereign strategy for smart cities presents an enormous opportunity for Canadians to develop new technologies, and new physical and digital infrastructure to serve the public interest, promote inclusive prosperity and even create new and better models of urban governance.

As long as Waterfront remains clueless about IP and data while deferring to Sidewalk on all the critical decisions, Canadians will continue to be treated to glitzy images of pseudo-tech dystopia while foreign companies profit from the IP and data Canadian taxpayers fund and create. Sidewalk Toronto is not a smart city. It is a colonizing experiment in surveillance capitalism attempting to bulldoze important urban, civic and political issues. Of all the misguided innovation strategies Canada has launched over the past three decades, this purported smart city is not only the dumbest but also the most dangerous.",2/2/2015,us probes moodys rating agency,business

THE CANADIAN PRESS

Somehow, were at risk of losing the plot on Sidewalk Toronto, Waterfront Torontos joint effort with Sidewalk Labs to create a new sustainable, affordable neighbourhood by the lake through forward-thinking urban design supported by leading-edge technology. Or, should I say, to develop a proposal for such a neighbourhood. Because thats all thats happening right now.

In March, 2017, Waterfront Toronto, looking at problems facing our city  from the skyrocketing cost of housing to a growing transit and congestion emergency  decided to try something radically different with land it owned at Parliament Slip. Instead of using its proven model of master planning followed by publicly tendering land for development, Waterfront Toronto issued a request for proposal (RFP) for an innovation partner to make a new neighbourhood, Quayside, as a demonstration project for big solutions to big problems. Higher levels of affordability, mobility, sustainability and economic opportunity were Quaysides targeted outcomes. Solutions piloted there could be taken up across the waterfront, the Greater Toronto Area and beyond.

Sidewalk Labs was started by Alphabet, Googles parent, to pursue the mission of improving life in cities. Its a for-profit enterprise, with the benefit of patient capital only a company such as Alphabet could provide. Sidewalk Labs responded to Waterfront Torontos RFP and was selected through a robust procurement process.

Given some of the criticism, you might be surprised to learn that Sidewalk Labs did not get any land as a result of winning this RFP  not a square metre. Instead, it committed US$50-million to develop a plan, with absolutely no guarantee it would be adopted and with onerous government-approval requirements. Sidewalk did so both because it believed Toronto was the best city in which to do this work, and because it was convinced of the feasibility of the innovative ideas and objectives at the heart of the project.

Yes, it is taking considerably longer than originally envisioned, and answers to key questions  including those related to digital governance  still need to be provided in the public process.

So what? Take the time to get it right. Not even the first draft of a plan has been finished, let alone has anyone asked for approval.

Among the issues being addressed with an array of expert Canadian advisers: How to fund not just traditional infrastructure, but digital and social infrastructure creating an inclusive community while facilitating innovation from Canadian players (not just Sidewalk)? How to deploy technology while protecting personal privacy and the public interest? How to manage data and intellectual property?

I have a glimpse of this work serving on a panel advising Waterfront Toronto on its digital strategy, focused on Quayside. I also served on Waterfronts board for 14 years, including 10 as chair, although my tenure ended before this project was hatched.

As Waterfront and Sidewalk are doing what they said they would do, the volume of criticism is rising. It can be hard to determine whats going on because of the mix of voices involved.

Some are committed urbanists and privacy advocates worried about whether this project will deliver the benefits it promises while protecting the public interest. They want to ensure that the final plan isnt rushed through or rubber-stamped by governments. I am confident that wont happen, but vigilance is healthy.

Others come to this discussion with different agendas: animus toward all global technology firms, including Google; opposition to any role by the private sector in developing a digital strategy; or longstanding resentment over Waterfront Torontos role in revitalization efforts, despite its successful track record. Listen to them, and this all started with evil intentions and must be stopped.

Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk Labs cant point any of this out and have been taking a lot of punches lately. But the tell is that opponents want to shut down the project before a proposal is even offered. Perhaps they fear that it might be something good for Toronto  a plan that breaks new ground, delivers real solutions and addresses digital governance.

That kind of plan might be embraced and approved  much to their disappointment.",2/4/2015,oil prices slide after rally,business
"Talks between Google-affiliate Sidewalk Labs and Waterfront Toronto on a deal to create a community where new, data-driven smart city technologies will be tested are months behind schedule.

Waterfront Toronto selected New York-based Sidewalk Labs, a unit of Googles parent Alphabet Inc., last October as the innovation and funding partner for a controversial project to develop a prime 12-acre plot of land dubbed Quayside near the foot of Parliament Street in Torontos eastern waterfront.

Since then, the two sides have been negotiating what they call a plan development agreement, which would lay out the scope of the complex project and allow talks on a final deal and master plan to begin. The final deal has been expected to come at years end or in early 2019.

In February, Waterfront Toronto chief executive Will Fleissig said he expected the plan development agreement to be signed and made public in April. However, on Thursday, as Sidewalk held a second roundtable discussion for residents interested in its ideas, Waterfront Toronto officials said a plan development agreement is now not expected until at least the summer.

Waterfront Toronto spokeswoman Carol Webb said the plan development deal is still under active negotiation. No specific issue is causing the delay, but there is no fixed date for a final deal, she said: We just want to get it right.

Mr. Fleissig has also said that once the plan development deal is signed, Waterfront Toronto will release the preliminary deal the two sides signed last fall, which has so far been kept secret for what his agency calls commercial reasons.

That secrecy caused an outcry among some Toronto city councillors, who have also raised concerns over Sidewalks ambitions to expand its experiments into the rest of the 800-acre eastern waterfront. Sidewalk officials have said they had no issue with releasing the text of that preliminary deal. The two sides released a brief summary of the deal last fall.

Sidewalk has said little concrete about its plans, despite a lavish $50-million public-relations and consultations effort. It initially promised to test everything from robot garbage trucks to a fleet of self-driving cars to sensors that could detect pedestrians and re-time traffic signals.

Many of the questions from the packed auditorium, the Daniels Spectrum in the redeveloped Regent Park along Dundas Street East, were from people concerned about the privacy implications of arrays of street-level sensors controlled by a Google affiliate.

Sidewalk officials ran through a responsible data-use policy framework released earlier this week. In it, Sidewalk pledges to tell people why their information is being collected and how it will be used. Sidewalk also promised not to sell the information to third parties or use it for advertising. Residents will be asked to opt-in to use services that require collecting personal data. The information will otherwise be de-identified, Sidewalk said.

"Hatchbacks are an optimal choice for those looking for the extra storage of an SUV, but the affordability, driving experience and fuel economy of a sedan. However, unlike sedans, which feature separate cabins for passengers and cargo, hatchbacks are designed with a combined passenger and cargo cabin, allowing for a much more efficient use of the interior space.

They also offer a more sedan-like driving experience and better fuel economy as compared to most SUVs thanks to their lower centre of gravity and relatively compact architecture. While the demand for SUVs continues to rise, their price often carries a premium relative to hatchbacks, making the latter a fitting choice for drivers who desire the best of both worlds.

Did you know Canada was the third country in space in 1962, after Russia and the United States? Just a first accomplishment of many. Today, Canada is an acknowledged world leader in space robotics, satellite communications, Earth observation and space science. Our diverse space sector includes some of Canadas most innovative companies, universities and research institutions. It generates $5.5-billion in revenue annually, employs 10,000 Canadians in highly skilled jobs, supports nearly 22,000 more Canadian jobs and contributes $2.3-billion to Canadas GDP.

But Canadas future in space may be in jeopardy.

Unlike other countries that have been increasing their contributions, Canadas investment in space has been declining for many years and weve had no long-term space plan for decades. Whereas in 1992 we were ranked eighth among all spacefaring countries in spending as a share of GDP, today weve fallen to 18th.

This downward trend is set to accelerate too, just as the economic opportunities of space are increasing exponentially. The current space-related global market opportunity is estimated to be $380-billion; analysts forecast it will grow to be a multitrillion-dollar market in the coming decades.

With the final frontier opening up, ambitious governments are setting their course and staking their claims. Britain aims to capture 10 per cent of the global space market by 2030. Tiny Luxembourg has set its sights on being the leading country in space mining. (Why space mining? Because just one asteroid, the size of a football field, is estimated to have between $25-billion and $50-billion worth of rare and precious metals, and there are currently 18,000 such asteroids in the vicinity of Earth.)

What about Canada? The current government has taken promising steps forward. It has made investing in innovation, science and economic development a priority, described space as at the cutting edge of innovation, appointed a Space Advisory Board and committed to developing a long-term space strategy. However, despite expectations to the contrary, Budget 2018 did not include funding for a space strategy.

With decisions about Budget 2019 being made in coming months, the clock is ticking. Not only are we losing ground to other countries, but an important door, now open, will soon close.

Canadas international space exploration partners, including the United States, Europe and Japan, are planning a return to the moon in the 2020s with a small space station, the Lunar Gateway. It will be the base for lunar surface exploration, a science lab, a communications hub and a staging platform to explore deeper space.

The international community expects Canada to provide advanced robotics for the Lunar Gateway  a third generation of the iconic Canadarm. Its a strategic and fairly modest financial commitment that secures our place as a full partner in the mission, keeping the door open for our astronauts to participate in future space missions and, potentially, to further contributions such as lunar surface rovers and space medicine technologies. But no commitment has yet been made.

Governments always have to juggle among competing priorities. And space can seem far away from our daily concerns. In truth, it touches the lives of Canadians 20 to 30 times a day, from weather predictions, to using an ATM, to checking a map on a smartphone, to downloading movies, to ground and air traffic management. Its going to be even more pervasive in the fast-approaching tomorrow of autonomous cars, smart cities and advanced autonomous AI and robotics.

We believe the current government of Canada has the vision and wisdom to reverse the neglect of recent decades and invest today for Canadas continued prosperity.

It has the support of Canadians. A recent Ipsos survey found that eight in 10 Canadians think the federal government should support the development of the space sector; and that Canadian success in advanced space technologies contributes to our knowledge economy, innovation and economic competitiveness.

Choosing to invest in space means holding onto our 60-year legacy; our leadership position in space science and technology; our vibrant and innovative space sector; our brightest young engineers, scientists and mathematicians; the beloved Canadarm program (92 per cent of Canadians say When I think about or see the Canadarm, I feel proud); and the exciting opportunities of the new space economy.

The new deal walks back or clarifies a number of provisions contained in that original deal, signed after Sidewalk Labs, a unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc., was chosen as the funding and innovation partner to develop a five-hectare (12-acre) parcel of land on the waterfront known as Quayside that sits at the end of Parliament Street.

Sidewalk has said it wanted to develop a long list of futuristic smart city innovations including sensors to detect pedestrians at traffic lights, robot vehicles that whisk away garbage in underground tunnels and a new street layout to accommodate a fleet of shared self-driving cars.

Sidewalk also argued that much of what it planned required more than just the Quayside parcel to work. According to documents released by Waterfront Toronto, which is a corporation created by all three levels of government, the original framework deal suggested that Sidewalk would be given the right to bolster its plans across the 324-hectare eastern waterfront when those lands, which are mostly city-owned, came under Waterfront Torontos purview.

But the new deal said that except for the initial Quayside parcel, no other waterfront lands will be automatically included in the project, except as justified with a business case and other government approvals.

No transfer or sale of land is included in the latest deal, although the original agreement contemplated options or requirements to transfer or make land available to Sidewalk Labs. Waterfront Toronto officials, however, say expanding the project across other lands is still a possibility.

As recently as July 23, senior city officials were still expressing concerns after reviewing an earlier draft of the proposed deal, according to a letter from interim city manager Giuliana Carbone to Meg Davis, chief development officer of Waterfront Toronto.

The letter, obtained by The Globe and Mail, calls for more clarity around the citys role in approving any use of its land, and said any real estate transactions must be subject to city council approval. It also called for the deal to be clear and explicit that the focus of the project should be the 12-acre Quayside site.

While Ms. Carbones letter acknowledges there may be benefits to larger scale projects, she said the final deal between Sidewalk and Waterfront Toronto will need to address the additional City process and approvals that would be required to implement these options.

The new deal also said Sidewalks initial US$50-million investment, some of which is being spent on a series of public consultations and work developing it plans, does not count as equity in the development  a possibility neither Sidewalk nor Waterfront Toronto had previously revealed. However, the agreement does say that if the final plans are approved, the US$50-million could be recovered in Sidewalks share of any profits.

Some critics had warned that the original framework was thin on details about Torontonians data and privacy, arguing it would involve collecting too much data, or give too much control to Sidewalk over the citys waterfront plans. The new agreement outlines a number of protections and promises, including a pledge to create the most privacy protected/citizen-centred set of policies and governance structures in the world, recognizing privacy as a fundamental human right. But specifics still remain to be worked out.

The new deal also does away with the notion that Sidewalk would be named the sites master developer and instead maintains Waterfront Toronto in the projects lead role.

Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalks Labs praised the deal as an important milestone as they continue to develop the project. It was approved unanimously by Waterfront Torontos board on Tuesday, but only after Toronto developer Julie Di Lorenzo, who has previously publicly questioned the plan, resigned from her seat on the board. Ms. Di Lorenzo could not be reached.

Board chair Helen Burstyn told reporters that Ms. Di Lorenzo was uncomfortable with the nature of the agreement with Sidewalk. She would not elaborate. Ms. Burstyn said Waterfront Toronto had done extreme due diligence on the deal, partly as a result of Ms. Di Lorenzos concerns.

The agreement comes after the sudden departure in early July of Waterfront Torontos CEO, Will Fleissig, who had been a driving force behind the project. Tuesdays deal is only a step toward a final master innovation and development plan, which the waterfront agency said wont be signed until next year.

Michael Nobrega, the acting CEO of Waterfront Toronto and the former president and CEO of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), said the new agreement protects the public interest, and that his agency has lots of exit ramps if it goes sideways. He called it ""an exciting opportunity to build a world-class waterfront.

Toronto Mayor John Tory said the agreement will allow the City to consider an innovative new approach to development, housing, public space and mobility in the Quayside District, and that he was confident Waterfront Toronto and all three levels of government would ensure it proceeds in the best interests of Toronto residents.",2/6/2015,final shipment of 15 chinese engines arrives at karachi por,business
"In the past month alone, officials from five different cities have asked me for introductions to Canadian companies with smart city technologies.

These days, it seems every mayor of a major city  including Toronto  is on the smart-city bandwagon, and for good reason. Population growth has led to increased traffic congestion, longer lineups, worsening pollution and added strain on urban infrastructure. Better technologies for keeping traffic and people flowing, improving how we deliver public services, modernizing the construction and maintenance of critical infrastructure, managing our waste and reducing our consumption of energy and water will only become more essential over the coming decades.

The good news is that Canada is well equipped to deliver, both at home and abroad. In Southern Ontario alone, there are dozens of promising new technology companies working hard to ease the aches and pains of cities by making them more efficient, resilient and livable.

Take Pantonium, which has developed intelligent-traffic-routing algorithms for fleet operators. The companys technology works by constantly adjusting to feedback from riders, vehicles and other factors to automate the management of vehicle routes. Its basically a control system for autonomous vehicles, and offers a way for transit agencies, health-care facilities and campuses to offer Uber-like, self-driving transit services.

Another promising venture is Liscena, which uses computer vision and machine learning to help people find city parking before they even leave their homes, as well as enter and exit parking garages without stopping  no machines, tickets or attendants. Its not obvious, but drivers can burn a lot of fuel over the course of a year simply looking for parking and waiting in lines. Eliminating the lines and prebooking the parking can significantly reduce a citys greenhouse gas emissions.

In commercial buildings, a company called CircuitMeter creates a network of connected sensors to track and analyze energy consumption data on a variety of systems, from lighting to boilers to escalators and elevators. Facility managers use the information to drive building efficiencies and reduce energy costs. Another venture, Feedback Solutions, uses sensors to track building occupancy so that the operation of ventilation systems can be automated, while Alert Labs installs intelligent devices that track water use, detect leaks and send mobile-phone alerts to property managers when flooding is suspected. No doubt insurance companies love it.

Even waste collection is getting smarter. Sensa Networks puts internet-connected sensors on commercial garbage bins and compactors to track the amount of waste that goes in. When a bin reaches a certain level the device triggers a pickup request, meaning waste collection trucks only roll when needed, saving the customer money and the collection company fuel. Fewer trucks on the road also means less city congestion.

What do all of these neat little companies have in common? They collect an enormous amount of data that, when combined into a single pool, can tell us how a city operates, day to day, minute to minute, including the movement of citizens at home, work and everywhere in between.

And who owns that data? How will it be protected? Those are questions Ontarios privacy commissioner has rightly asked, and theyre particularly relevant now that Alphabets Sidewalk Labs is working with Waterfront Toronto to build a truly smart community from the ground up. In the wake of Facebooks recent privacy scandal, citizens have more reason than ever for concern.

Yet, its the direction we need to go. Data privacy is like a lot of things  handled well, handled responsibly, it can create a lot of good, Stuart Lombard, chief executive of smart-thermostat maker Ecobee, recently told me.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT


Ecobees thermostats collect a tremendous amount of data about energy use in homes, as well as how people use and come and go from their homes. For two years now, Ecobee has been asking its customers to voluntarily disclose their data for research purposes, and so far more than 40,000 across Canada and the United States have obliged.

Already, researchers in Indiana have used the data to demonstrate to public officials that the state didnt need to spend US$1-billion on a new gas-fired power plant. If you dont have the data, decision makers are flying blind. Theyre making choices based on gut feelings, Mr. Lombard says.

Ecobee is being transparent, responsible and earning the trust of its customers by telling them how their data will be used. But as cities become smarter and the pools of data being collected become more plentiful and diverse, there will be a need for a neutral custodian to aggregate, help standardize and responsibly manage access to the richer, larger, more comprehensive pool that emerges.

Without such a neutral third party, smart cities risk becoming a Wild West of data silos. Accountability (not to mention public trust) could be diminished, if not lost. More than that, the opportunity to tap into all this data for the greater good  to build better, more sustainable and livable cities  could very well be squandered.

"VANCOUVER  A report from BC Hydro says British Columbians are addicted to personal electronics, prompting a dramatic shift in electricity consumption across the province.

The report from the Crown-owned utility says B.C.s obsession with devices including smartphones, laptops and tablets has hiked electricity use for small electronics by 150 per cent in less than 30 years.

The survey of 400 B.C. residents shows 20 per cent of those under 34 would give up a days pay rather than be without their phone, while many more admit they may be fonder of their smartphone than their spouse.

One quarter agree they would rather skip contact with their partner for a day than give up their smartphone over the same period, while that number rises to one-third for those aged 55 to 64.

Twenty per cent of respondents admit to sleeping with their phone, 50 per cent check it the moment they wake up and two-thirds would forego their morning coffee for 48 hours rather than start the day without their device.

Smartphone owners are especially faithful, with the survey revealing they use their devices for nearly five hours every day. Hydro president Chris ORiley says the desire to be connected is driving B.C.s shift in power usage.

While none of these devices use a lot a power individually, taken together, household electricity use from these devices has increased from seven per cent to 17 per cent since the early 1990s, ORiley says in a news release.

Each small device only uses about 15 to 20 watts when plugged in, but several in use simultaneously  along with the peripheral devices often used with them  all add up, says the Hydro release.

It points to a dramatic jump in the number of wireless routers used with new smart televisions, along with set-top boxes for high-definition TV.

Hydro recommends the use of available power management technology now built into most new smartphones, tablets, laptops and game consoles, or the use of so-called smart strips or advanced power bars that shut down devices when they are not in use.",2/6/2015,contract for 650mw supply to k electric cannot be renewed ministry,business
"As technology evolves, massive amounts of new data are being generated every day. In the next few years, as the number of smartphones, sensors and other connected devices generating and sharing information grows by the tens of billions worldwide, the term big data will seem like an understatement.

Anyone who has used Google Maps during rush hour has already seen how data analytics can make our lives easier. By looking at large sets of traffic flow data, the system can predict travel times and recommend the fastest route. In the near future however, the benefits will extend far beyond helping Canadians get from point A to point B.

Cities are starting to recognize the huge potential of big data to inform decisions that can dramatically improve the lives of their residents. Anonymized mass-movement patterns can help plan emergency routes, leading to faster response times for first responders, and can help city planners locate new roads, schools and services. Algorithms can even help law enforcement predict when and where crimes are most likely to take place.


Big data helps commuters chose the fastest, most efficient routes.
The city of Glasgow, Scotland, has set out to become a Future City with an ambitious plan to use technology and big data to make life in the city smart and more sustainable. The plan includes intelligent street lighting that can identify air pollution, detect disturbances like car crashes and monitor pedestrian and traffic flow to provide invaluable data to city planners. The city has also developed a customizable dashboard for citizens to create their own personal views of Glasgows data in real time.

Here in Canada, Toronto is one of 10 cities globally that have partnered with Cityzenith, a firm that helps manage and interpret the massive amounts of data that cities can collect. Cityzenith has created visual traffic simulations, which allow local officials make better-informed decisions about new infrastructure planning and transit. Additionally, last year the city held a hackathon called TrafficJam, which brought together engaged citizens, digital creatives and data detectives to find data-driven solutions for Torontos traffic troubles.

In Calgary, Steve Liang, associate professor of geomatics engineering at the University of Calgary and CEO of SensorUp, is piloting a project to help measure air quality in the city. Working with the City of Calgary, Liang enlisted the help of 50 local volunteers and provided them with air quality sensors for their homes. It was a simple plan that gave Calgary a comprehensive, real-time look at its air quality. In the future, this data could be combined with other inputs, like traffic patterns, to better understand how Calgary can improve air quality.

The maturation of affordable open-source sensors, ubiquitous networks and unlimited computing power is a perfect storm for smart cities, Liang says.

That perfect storm could make a big difference in the way cities deal with disasters. A joint project between the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Japan Science and Technology Agency is researching how data can improve disaster management.

Tokyo is disaster prone, says Liang. When a disaster strikes, if they can very easily aggregate people movement data, they can evacuate people in the most effective way.


Smart traffic lights could help reduce congestion in downtown grids.
Canadian cities can also use this technology to save lives in the event of an earthquake, flood or fire.

Maintaining privacy by creating and adopting new standards for big data will be critical, and organizations are emerging to help cities and businesses engage in data analytics programs that fully maintain citizens privacy.

Ann Cavoukian, three-term Privacy Commissioner of Ontario now serving as the Executive Director of the Privacy and Big Data Institute at Ryerson University, says that realizing the potential of big data does not need to come at the expense of personal privacy.

Usually privacy is presented as a trade off, but its a false dichotomy, she says. We can  and must  develop big data programs that allow the achievement of multiple objectives, such as privacy and public safety, simultaneously.

Cavoukian says that when organizations install privacy protections up front, it ensures that data is de-identified and personal information is never part of the picture. When that information is then aggregated into massive data sets, it allows organizations to look at trends and patterns without compromising privacy.

As cities gradually come to embrace the power of big data, the positive impacts on everyday life will be real. Liang imagines a world where sensors become so inexpensive that they will be deployed literally everywhere.

According to Liang, Whether its traffic or air quality or water usage, wherever we can quantify, we can optimize. This is the grand vision: that every inefficiency will be eliminated. It could completely change our world and we are only at the beginning.",2/6/2015,tokyo stocks open up 1.09 per,business
"KINGSTON, Ont.  A southeastern Ontario city says it is teaming up with Bell Canada to implement new technology that will monitor certain municipal operations in what its calling a Smart City program.

The project will collect and organize data from internet-connected items to help the city of Kingston, Ont., keep track of things like energy use.

A joint statement from Kingston and Bell says the project will help the city make better informed decisions on matters like municipal operations and infrastructure.

Kingston says the first two parts of its Smart City program will roll out this spring.

The city will introduce digital kiosks that provide Wi-Fi access, real-time event updates and charging services, as well as 911 emergency buttons among other features.


The city will also begin closely monitoring energy data, which it says will help reduce carbon emissions and meet municipal environmental targets. It says it will also help the city better co-ordinate maintenance.

Kingston and Bell note that the federal government announced $300 million in funding for Smart Cities over 11 years in its 2017 budget.

This partnership with Bell will create cutting-edge technology for us and put Kingston on the map as being one of the most innovative cities in Canada, said city mayor Bryan Paterson said in a statement.

"OTTAWA  Cities looking for extra federal cash are being pushed to think outside the box and take some risks as part of a federal challenge that launches today.

Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi is in Calgary to unveil what the government calls its Smart Cities Challenge, which will provide millions of dollars to communities that come up with the most interesting and innovative ideas.

Other ministers will be in Ottawa and Montreal to make similar announcements.

The ideas could be an after-school program for at-risk youth that lets them learn to write code; a mobile app to help seniors and caregivers co-ordinate transportation; or equipping homeless shelters with online learning hubs to help users find jobs.

Whatever idea cities try, the government says the winning proposals must be scaleable and easy to replicate in other communities, must incorporate data and technology, and must establish measurable and achievable outcomes.


But at its core, the challenge is designed to shift how cities think about delivering services and building infrastructure, and to encourage efforts to achieve a much broader impact on municipal planning.

The Liberals first mentioned the challenge in this years budget, setting aside up to $80 million in prizes for winning communities and groups. The top prize will be $50 million; two prizes of up to $10 million each to cities with fewer than 500,000 residents; and a $5 million prize to cities with fewer than 30,000 residents.

Cities will have to wait until 2019 to find out who wins.

The program is modelled on a similar challenge in the United States two years ago to get cities to rethink their transit and transportation systems. The US$50 million program put an emphasis on use of technology, much as the Canadian version does.

The American challenge came up in talks Sohi had with his U.S. counterparts prior to the Liberal governments 2017 budget.",2/9/2015,oil prices extend gai,business
"COLUMBUS, Ohio  Ohios capital city unveiled an operating system on Thursday that will gather data for its pioneering smart city transportation project.

Columbus beat out six other mid-sized cities in 2016 to win the U.S. Department of Transportations Smart City Challenge, a contest aimed at encouraging innovative ideas for moving people and goods more quickly, cheaply and efficiently.

The effort is supported by a $40 million federal grant and $10 million from Paul G. Allen Philanthropies. It has the potential to reduce collisions, speed first responder response times, curb freeway delays and get products to consumers faster.

Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther said launching the Smart Columbus Operating System is a major milestone on Columbus smart city journey, allowing officials to better analyze, interpret and share data that will help solve critical challenges and inspire innovation.

But the Democrat said the ultimate goal is to make life better.

Fundamental to becoming smart as a city is discovering how to use data to improve city services and quality of life for residents, he said. When we apply data to the challenges we experience as a city, we can transform outcomes in education, employment, healthcare and even access to healthy food.


The citys Smart Columbus team will manage and distribute 1,100 data feeds through the new operating platform to government offices and private companies.

The information thats collected will help Columbus integrate self-driving cars, connected vehicles, smart sensors and other developing transportation technologies into the life of the city.

The city won its spot as the testing ground over San Francisco; Pittsburgh; Denver; Portland, Oregon; Austin, Texas; and Kansas City, Missouri.

Thursdays operating system launch comes amid efforts by Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich to advance smart transportation technology statewide.

Kasich signed an executive order last week authorizing autonomous vehicle research to take place on all public roads across the state. The order laid out safety parameters for such projects and creates a voluntary pilot program linking local governments to participating companies.

The order extended Kasichs efforts to make Ohio a hub of smart vehicle research and development.",2/9/2015,hsbc admits swiss bank failings over client tax,business
"Emergent technologies are poised to radically change how we work and live. They will transform our cities and workplaces, shifting jobs and entrepreneurship in new directions, and spur new ways to manage our lives. All of society will be affected, up to and including how we interact with machines themselves.

Sophisticated machines and applications that communicate online will accelerate demand for broadband internet and challenge existing information and telecommunication norms.


All of this will require ongoing discussions about security, infrastructure and open-data policy and planning. We now need action. We must move past: We know its coming and have to do something to Here is how we can implement and collaborate to make it happen.

As a researcher focused on digitalization of cities for 20 years, I have authored two books and multiple articles. I have led teams of consultants to develop intelligent communities across Canada, and been the chief jurist for the International Intelligent Community Awards for the last 12 years.

Heres why I believe were about to start turning these visions into reality:

Robots and AI

Robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) will permeate a large part of our daily life by 2025 and affect most of our industries, according to the Pew Research Center. We see some of these changes today.

Robots already perform tasks as diverse as dispensing frozen yogurt in malls, monitoring rail systems and keeping millions of elevators running smoothly. IBMs Watson AI technology is used in health care to analyze DNA and help us determine trends and future options for our health.

Wearable fitness devices with personal plans link us to team members to set and achieve group goals (I call these personal nagging devices). I have a robot to vacuum my floors (I love it) and I am closely watching the progress of personal robot assistants with amazing capabilities already being showcased around the world.

Id love to have Hondas ASIMO at my facultys front entrance to answer questions and be a tutor for students.

Mobile devices and Internet of Things

Over the next five years, more than a million new mobile broadband subscribers will be added per day worldwide, Ericssons 2017 mobility report estimates. More people have multiple mobile phone subscriptions, and more will choose mobile instead of conventional wired, landline phones.

Desktop computer demand is now flat in contrast to growing demand for tablets, laptops, drones, smartphones and other mobile gadgets, causing broadband internet subscriptions to increase exponentially. This will strain our broadband infrastructure as we expand the Internet of Things, in which every object has a wireless chip that connects it to everything else.

The number of connected objects  including sensors in cars, wearable devices, electricity and gas meter readers in homes, point-of-sale terminals in businesses and drones  grew 31 per cent between 2016 and 2017, to 8.4 billion devices, according to Gartner analysts. And the number of devices is forecast to grow to 81 billion by 2025, according to IDC research.

Demand for sensors in fixed locations such as our homes (security cameras and motion sensors, smart fridges, meter readers, etc.) continue to increase. They save money and labour, and make our lives easier and safer.

That volume of devices will give us a lot of data to analyze, which calls for improved policies on security and privacy as mobile sensors monitor our personal spaces and bodies for our activities and health care.

Population, urban and automation growth

The proportion of the worlds population living in cities is expected to grow from 54 per cent to 66 per cent by 2050, adding another 2.5 billion people to urban areas, the United Nations predicts. We must prepare by creating high-quality, sustainable communities through smart use of technology.

For example, were finally seeing more telework or home-based work. This has been possible for 20 years but slow to take hold, mostly due to our desire to hang on to old paradigms despite an increasing proportion of knowledge workers. Telework can limit stress on roads, families and result in decreased operating costs while lessening our carbon footprint.

AT&Ts predictions for automation, growth and change are staggering. Tasks performed by bots grew 200 per cent over the past year and are expected to triple this year. This could be scary for cities that are job creators, but bots could also improve quality of life, acting as personal robot assistants.

Of course, technology has good and bad sides. Drones can pose threats to privacy but also have benefits: AT&T uses them for cellphone service in disaster areas, new four-rotor quadcopter drones safely provide imagery to firefighters and Airbus uses drones for airplane safety inspections.

These applications can be extended to communities and to meet industrial challenges in many sectors. Cities concentrate talent, which will bring new innovations, and we will need them to deal with the negative effects of expanding cities and the side-effects of increased technology use.

These trends suggest a third industrial revolution. Are our infrastructure and policies ready for it, and our industries prepared to innovate?

Are we ready for the future?

The Conference Board of Canada identified lags in innovation, with Canada ranking 13 out of 16 in our peer group of industrialized countries. Much of that evaluation was based on our use of information and communication technologies (ICT), the main element in the next wave of change. Clearly, we can do better.

Canada must evolve its policies if its going to develop new entrepreneurial ventures, infrastructure and help its citizens to adjust to the changes while sustainably managing our cities.

This isnt only a government responsibility. It requires leadership at all levels that collaboratively plans for efficient, effective and safe use of automated systems such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, driverless cars and more.

For example, at least 33 U.S. states have passed or are considering driverless-car legislation, and Michigan had its first driverless pizza delivery in a public-private partnership with MCity. In Europe, Eindhoven already has driverless buses, and fleet transport trucking will be among the first to use the technology. Some technologies and applications will evolve on their own, as Uber did, but others will need concerted planning and action to flourish.

Some of the most interesting machine-learning applications will only be successful if were more open to sharing data. As a society, thats been difficult. Canada has some of the worlds toughest spam regulations (CASL), which limits our ability to use data. Most of our data is in private databases with little open access.

International leadership

Canada has been a leader throughout the short history of digitalization, with pilot projects in every province as early as the mid-90s to demonstrate what smart communities could look like.

Despite a lack of a strong national agenda, Canadian communities have punched far above their weight, receiving international awards from the Intelligent Community Forum every year since 2002. Now, new federal leadership and initiatives promise to reignite a Canadian vision of digitalization.

Ottawa recently announced a Smart Cities Challenge that could help the country improve and innovate along with technology accelerator programs and geographic technology super-clusters.

These initiatives support researchers and entrepreneurs in next-generation fields such as quantum computing, optics and materials in Waterloo. Thats good news for Canada and an opportunity to mobilize a quadruple helix of stakeholders (academia, governments, private sector, consumers) to innovate.

Canada will get the chance to examine all of these topics at The Global Forum on Digitalization (GF) in Winnipeg from Oct. 1 to 3. The two-day discussion and networking event with global leaders is being held in Canada for the first time in its 25-year history. Its the perfect opportunity to show how were preparing for the economic transformation looming ahead.",2/10/2015,oil prices fall as iea predicts weak rebound,business
"Sidewalk Toronto is not just going to be a fancy high-tech community that will sit on the waterfront of Canadas largest city. The newly announced, Alphabet Inc-backed project will be similar to a smartphones operating system, according to the company.

What made (the smartphone) ultimately magical is that it enabled millions of people around the world to use their imagination and skills to create apps that, in most cases, no one ever dreamed the platform would be used for and keep it fresh, changing, useful and current, said Dan Doctoroff, chief executive of Sidewalk Labs, Googles sibling, in an interview.

The notion of the city as a platform  combing physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure, governance and then enabling people to create on top of it  is a completely different approach to city building.

On Tuesday, Sidewalk Labs said it will be investing $50 million into Torontos waterfront to create a mixed-use community that uses new digital technology and unique urban design to solve city problems such as sustainability, affordability, mobility and economic opportunity.

The announcement was made alongside Waterfront Toronto  which issued a request for proposal for the 12 acres of land in March  as well as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and Toronto Mayor John Tory. The three levels of government have committed $1.25 billion in funding for waterfront revitalization.


The project is called Sidewalk Toronto, and it will start with a 12-acre neighbourhood called Quayside before expanding to roughly 800 acres in the years to follow if all goes to plan, the company said.

Sidewalk was founded on the belief that there is a combination of technologies that are uniquely becoming available at this time, this moment right now, that are capable of addressing some of those big urban challenges, Doctoroff said.


You could be in a position to actually start construction 18 months to two years from now... with the goal of opening up the first building in 2021 or so

   
WALT DISNEY-INSPIRED CITY OF THE FUTURE
The idea is that Quayside and the larger Sidewalk Toronto project will be a model city for the world. It will be constantly changing as it tests the latest technology and urban designs when it comes to everything from waste management and mixed-use buildings to transportation and business.

For inspiration, Sidewalk Labs looked at about 150 different projects from the last 50 years where companies or organizations tried to make a city of the future or so-called innovation districts. The one that resonated the most was Walt Disneys original plan for EPCOT in Florida before he died in 1966 and his company eventually decided to turn into another theme park.

His original vision, more than anyone elses, was the one that inspired us because he really got that integration of urbanism and technology right, Doctoroff said, adding that Disney truly understood the idea of the city being a platform that people create on top of.

He realized that the city is never done. Its always going to evolve and you want people to play a role in evolving it and you have to create the conditions for that evolution up front. We were more inspired by him than any attempt over the last 50 years.

GETTING APPROVED
Sidewalk Labs said it searched the globe for the right place to house its prototype community. The company looked at 52 cities and hundreds of potential sites in North America, as well as other areas such as western Europe and Australia.

Doctoroff said Sidewalk was looking for a city with a significant amount of land and had several key things including a culture of openness and diversity, self awareness about the issues it was facing, governmental alignment, an openness to different approaches and a combination of urban legacy melding with a tech ecosystem.

When we looked at Toronto, it literally checked the boxes on every count, he said.

At the same time as Sidewalk Labs was searching for options, Waterfront Toronto  an organization formed in 2001 as partnership between three levels of Canadian government to manage the lands by Lake Ontario  had been reevaluating itself and its mandate for the city.

People were placing big bets in terms of the private sector on what was going to happen down here, said Will Fleissig, chief executive of Waterfront Toronto, in an interview. 

But this was mostly our land, the waterfront, so we had a chance to create this idea of a test bed. Lets try some new things, try some new partnerships and see if this idea of bringing people in earlier rather than us coming up with a plan and asking the private sector to respond.

Waterfront Toronto issued its RFP in March to find a partner to help solve urban issues and work together from the ground up. In the end, there were three final proposals that went into the next round, each with very deep discussions, Fleissig said.

After visiting sample sites or projects and bringing in a selection committee with third party experts, the recommendation was to go with Sidewalk Labs proposal and Waterfront Torontos board approved.

Now we are developing a plan. There is no land involved at this point, he said. These are initial ideas that these guys have put out, but what does everyone else think? How would they like to hook into this?

Tuesdays seemingly daunting announcement is possible and great for the city, according to Matti Siemiatycki, an associate professor at the University of Torontos department of geography and planning.

There is major development by a number of large multinational corporations already investing (in the waterfront), so I think the scale is feasible, he said. Whats really interesting and exciting is the new possibilities of having companies like Google and Sidewalk involved, because with that technology we arent just building the city of yesterday, we are really trying to understand how to build the city of tomorrow.

The project signifies how important Toronto is on a global scale and how major international corporations are understanding what the city brings to the table, including its values and diversity, Siemiatycki said.

Technology is a means to an end. It allows you to further the values that a place holds and Toronto is very exciting to test this because of what sits at its core.

 


NEXT STEPS
Before breaking ground on Quayside, there will be a year of consultation with the public, private sector and others beginning with a town hall in Toronto on November 1. A plan will then be brought to the Waterfront Toronto board and Sidewalk Labs for approval.

"OTTAWA/TORONTO  Alphabet Inc, the owner of Google, will announce plans to help develop a section of Torontos waterfront on Tuesday, in the biggest project disclosed so far by its Sidewalk Labs unit that is using new technologies to develop high-tech urban areas.

Google will be the anchor tenant at the site that Sidewalk Labs  which designs, tests and builds new technologies for smart cities  will develop, two sources familiar with the plan said.

Sidewalk Labs won a contract to develop a 12-acre site named Quayside on the waterfront of Lake Ontario in a project funded by Waterfront Toronto, a public agency funded by federal, provincial and city governments.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will announce the agreement in Toronto on Tuesday with Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt and Sidewalk Labs chief Dan Doctoroff, one of the sources said.
Sidewalk Labs website says it wants to develop a large-scale district that can serve as a living laboratory for urban technology. The unit has teams that work on housing affordability, healthcare for underserved populations and smart traffic management.

Google will move some 300 employees in Toronto to the new space, one of the sources said, including a team from its Google Brain unit led by artificial intelligence pioneer Geoffrey Hinton.


The company will continue to boost its engineering operations in the Kitchener-Waterloo area, which is about 90 kilometres west of Toronto.

Sidewalk Labs has previously worked with Qualcomm Inc and Civiq Smartscapes to retrofit New York City phone booths into digital billboards that serve as WiFi hotspots.

Intersection, the Sidewalk Labs subsidiary behind the effort, recently launched similar kiosks in London. Another division, Flow, has held talks with cities such as Columbus, Ohio, about providing software to evaluate transit programs.",2/11/2015,pakistan wants early implementation of tapi project ,business
"In late January, a commuter train derailed in northern Italy, near Milan. Three people were killed and 46 injured in the crash. An investigation into the cause of the derailment has focused on maintenance issues after a broken piece of track was found.

The dramatic event has left commuters on edge. Many worry about their safety and that other derailments might occur in the future.


And they have lashed out at the regional train company Trenord that serves the region after it blamed delays on a technical inconvenience (inconveniente technico) on Twitter.


The incident was terrible, but it was perhaps not a surprise.

The Italian regional railway systems have been criticized for their lack of maintenance. Italy ranked 15th in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index, just ahead of Lithuania, Ireland, Portugal and most of the eastern European countries. According to Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, Italy ranks sixth when it comes to rail accidents. In 2016, the country saw 99 rail accidents and 127 injuries and deaths  and the largest increase in deaths of all 28 member countries since the previous year.

Italy has long been locked in a debate over what to do about its aging local railway systems. But because of the derailments location  near the suburb of Segrate  a discussion has opened up on the need to develop of suburban infrastructure.

Investments have come more readily to high-speed rail systems like Trenitalias Le Frecce and Italo-Nuovo Trasporto Viaggiatori. But the local networks that connect city centres to their suburbs are struggling under the pressure of suburban expansion.

Italys big cities have historically faced a mismatch in the development of public transportation. Instead of developing a regional network, the focus has been on separate municipal systems or on the national high-speed railway network.

A deeper regionalization of transportation systems is perhaps what the Italian metropolitan areas need. They could learn from the experiences of cities in other countries, such as the Greater Toronto and Hamilton areas in southern Ontario, where the integration of Metrolinx and GoTransit has reshaped transport distribution.

Infrastructure an enabler

Infrastructure, including rail systems, are enablers that provide the conditions to make other activities possible. It makes the suburbs feasible; without it, suburbanites would not be able to travel throughout the larger metropolitan areas where they live.

The worlds population is increasingly moving from rural areas to more urban ones. By 2045, more than six billion are expected to be urbanized thanks to constant suburban growth. In this regard, suburban infrastructure is becoming more important.

Not only is suburban infrastructure a key aspect of this growth, connecting outlying neighbourhoods to the central urban core, but it also saves suburbanites time and money as they move from home to school to work and elsewhere; they are dependent on transport services.

Yet we need change. Cities are beginning to leave behind their dependence on automobiles, as they improve  and integrate  their metropolitan and regional transportation systems and become large city-regions.

For example, in Montreal, the Reseau express metropolitain (REM) will serve the whole metropolitan area through a sophisticated rail and bus system inserted into the urban landscape. In Auckland, New Zealand, new electric trains have transformed the transit system after a recent population boom. And in Paris, the Reseau Express Regional (RER), a commuter and rapid transit system, connects Europes second largest city with its huge banlieue, the Paris suburbs.

An uneven development

However, the development of suburban infrastructure is fragmented. It is strongly dependent on a citys political, technical and financial priorities. Local administrations in suburbs cope daily with the provision of adequate transport infrastructures that connect suburban areas with metropolitan cores. Yet, highways still get more attention.

In Milans suburban area, where the train accident occurred, a new beltway called TEEM was launched in 2014. But three years later, traffic volume remains very low and its usefulness has been called into question.

There is also a high degree of unevenness in the way the suburbs develop.

Some geographic areas expand more rapidly than others, making it difficult for local governments to meet the suburbs infrastructure needs. Wealth and poverty are juxtaposed in suburban areas. Some suburbs are growing faster than others as target-areas of private investments, whereas other towns experience economic declines.

Social inequality is both reflected in and intensified by high levels of unevenness in the availability of transportation infrastructure. Some suburbanites will have no choice and remain car-dependent, whereas others may use the train even if they own cars.

Retrofitting solutions

Given this inequality, how do we identify the right solution?

A retrofitting process that focuses on fairness would be a good option. Just as spatial justice looks at the consequence of urban development on social fabric, transport justice can be seen as a new perspective to discuss the adaptation of metropolitan transportation planning to the commuters daily life.

If we are to reduce the gap between the growing suburbs and their infrastructure, we must reduce disparities, give local services the same attention as high-speed trains and develop routes that meet commuters needs.",2/11/2015,hotel prices skyrocket in australia ahead of world cu,business
"FREDERICTON  Scientists in one of Canadas snowiest cities will help a sunny Caribbean island switch to a green energy grid, leaving fossil fuels in its wake.

University of New Brunswick researchers have received $4.3 million from Ottawa and Emera Inc.  the parent company of Barbados Light & Power Co.  to develop potentially breakthrough renewable energy technology.

The five-year project, led by electrical and computer engineering professor Liuchen Chang, will be based at the universitys smart-grid research lab in Fredericton.

At this stage, were getting the data from Barbados and doing the research and modelling, Chang said Wednesday. In the next stage, we are going to bring the technologies to Barbados and work with Emera on the installation and testing in the field.

With roughly 120,000 power customers and a grid capacity of 240 megawatts, the Lesser Antilles island is the right size to test green technology in a small-scale, energy-hungry market.

What we want to do is use the island as a demonstration project and showcase these technologies, said Chris Huskilson, Emera president and CEO.

The reason were talking about Barbados is because its an economy that actually has the opportunity to go 100 per cent renewable more rapidly than most other places. It has a mandate from the government to do that, and also a tremendous solar resource and a very good wind resource.

In 2010, the islands electricity generation was 100 per cent oil-fired, which has since been reduced by about 20 per cent. The country has pledged to transition to a fully renewable energy grid by 2045.

However, one of the long-standing issues with renewable energy is its intermittent nature  the sun has to be shining or wind blowing for energy to be produced.

Its one of the challenges Chang and his UNB team plan to address through electric vehicle storage systems, shaping customer demand and encouraging a proliferation of small-scale generation.

Were focused on  battery storage and electrical vehicles, small generators such as rooftop (photovoltaic) systems and customer load, Chang said, adding that the smart-grid technologies can enable an electricity grid to shift to 100 per cent renewable energy without being crippled by the intermittent nature of renewables.

A focus of the Barbados project is so-called distributed energy resources, which includes small-scale renewable projects like rooftop solar or wind systems.

About three-quarters of the solar energy that is being produced today is from rooftops, so there will be a combination of larger scale and distributed, Huskilson said. Part of what the smart-grid technology being developed at UNB will allow us to do is to control those rooftop devices and add storage and the ability to actually have them support the grid in a much better way.

Chang said rooftop solar and wind may be small in size but you aggregate them together and they are huge.

Barbados Light and Power plans to offer incentives to customers to plug in their electric vehicles as a cost-saving measure.

The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency is investing $2.8 million through the Atlantic Innovation Fund while the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada has contributed $82,100. Emera has put $1.4 million towards this project.

Huskilson said the smart-grid technology being developed at UNB can be deployed anywhere in the world, including in Atlantic Canada",2/12/2015,nokia 215 dual sim launched in paki,business
"RALEIGH, N.C.  Electric utilities are pouring billions of dollars into a race to prevent terrorists or enemy governments from shutting down the power grid and everything that depends on electricity in Americas hyper-connected society.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security detailed last month how Russian hackers have targeted the nations energy grid. Officials said they could have caused major blackouts, but instead, the hackers appeared more focused on reconnaissance.

The concern over cyber-threats comes as power companies shift focus to pursue extensive upgrades in software, switches and wires to enable a much more flexible distribution of electricity.

That means the likelihood of rate increases for consumers. Utilities have long based their business on building power plants and selling the juice to customers, adding a regulator-approved profit margin to pay for it all. But the need for big generation projects has fallen after decades of energy conservation, fewer factories and the swapping of coal-fired power plants for cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas.

So electricity companies are telling Wall Street theyre shifting their business plans. Now theyre having customers pay to replace aging equipment, block malicious hackers, minimize outages, accommodate the upsurge of wind and solar power and allow consumers more control over when and how much power they use.

The investment research firm SSR projects that increased investment in the distribution grid will be the primary source of growth for most utilities over the next five to 10 years. Those investments mean a stream of new revenue that could last decades.

This infrastructure will provide significant benefits to our customers, including improved customer control and convenience, and cyber and physical security enhancements while creating thousands of jobs and supporting the states economy, Duke Energy CEO Lynn Good told Wall Street analysts this month. Her spokesman declined an interview request.

The message that big spending is needed is amplified by U.S. government warnings of dire consequences if the grid isnt refashioned to make it tougher to black out and easier to restore. The Department of Energys latest cybersecurity plan, a National Academy of Sciences report last year and advocacy groups like Protect Our Power are among the voices calling for sustained federal support for grid improvements.

Congress created grants for smart grid investments a decade ago, but hasnt appropriated funds for them since the 2009 stimulus package.

The grid was essentially built to carry electricity in one direction, from power plants to homes and businesses over a network of poles, wires and high-voltage transmission equipment. Now it has to be updated to accommodate renewable energy that can surge and flow in many directions, be stored in massive batteries and even move in reverse as solar-equipped homes and businesses sell their excess power.

Key pieces of equipment, such as transformers and transmission wires, are 25 years or older. And hackers arent the only threat: The power supply must be protected against physical attacks, from criminals shooting out transformers to severe weather and even solar storms.

Old infrastructure needs to be replaced. Its that simple. And thats terrific for the industry, because companies do earn a very competitive rate of return on new investment and so theres a reason to invest, said Ronald Silvestri, managing director of global equity research at investment management firm Neuberger Berman. This gives the sector a very long tail of attractive growth for many years.

More than three dozen regulated electric companies last year devoted almost half their more than $120 billion in total capital spending to grid improvements, according to the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association for investor-owned utilities. Spending on new power plants fell to less than a third of the total, the trade group said, as electricity demand decreased to its lowest since Recession-marred 2009.

Some of the fastest-growing utilities over the past decade, including American Electric Power, Californias Edison International and Floridas NextEra Energy, are the same ones that led the way into grid upgrades, said Eric Selmon of SSR. Profits over the next decade will hinge on increased investment in updating and modernizing the distribution grid, Selmon said.

Were at the early stages of infrastructure modernization. Its a multi-decade theme that I believe is being vastly underappreciated, Silvestri said.

Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power plans to invest nearly $18 billion in grid improvements in the next four years, across 11 states from Virginia to Oklahoma. AEP said it delivered a total shareholder return of 21 per cent in 2017, and the investments will help keep profits growing at 5 per cent to 7 per cent year after year, chairman and chief executive officer Nicholas Akins said.

Charlotte-based Duke Energy plans to invest $25 billion on grid improvements over the next decade across its territories in the Carolinas, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana.

Utilities wont say exactly how they plan to thwart hackers, but their defences partly include installing more smart-grid communication technology across the network, such as remote sensors and transmission equipment that can better detect suspicious activity and automatically reroute power around outages, Duke Energy said.

Duke Energy already is collecting grid modernization charges in Florida, Ohio and Indiana. But North Carolina regulators this year wouldnt approve the companys proposal to start charging the average household an extra $3,000 to $4,000 over the coming decade to bury power lines and modernize electricity delivery systems.

Good has told analysts Duke Energy can deliver profit growth of around 6 per cent a year if state regulators approve the spending and associated profit margins the company wants on grid investments. That compares to an average annual return of 8.3 per cent over the past decade for companies on the S&P 500 Index. Including stockholder dividends, Duke Energys return should be more like a steady 8-10 per cent a year, the company is telling investors.

I see over the next decade more investment in the grid, relatively, than any other part of the supply chain of electricity, Good said in June at a talk in Washington",2/12/2015,cnic number now tax number only companies allowed ntn dar,business
"Nearly 14 years ago, Rob McDowell bought a sky-high condominium in The 501, a hip, sleek apartment building in Vancouvers Yaletown neighborhood. He was single and had no kids, so 500 square feet seemed quite enough, especially given the panoramic views from the windows of his 29th-story apartment. He could see the ocean. He could see islands in the distance. He could look over the other towers to the forested slopes of the North Shore Mountains. When the fog rolled in, he felt he was floating above it.

I invited all my friends up there to see the view, McDowell told me later. I was so happy.

But that changed as the months went past.

Whenever McDowell left his apartment, he would follow a hallway he shared with 20-odd people to an elevator bank he shared with nearly 300 people. When the elevator door opened, he could never be sure whom he would see inside. Standing a foot or two apart, well within the zone of personal space, McDowell and his neighbours would studiously avoid eye contact, gazing up instead at the LED floor display. McDowell felt increasingly uneasy. His view was no salve for solitude.

You go up the elevator, into your apartment, the door closes, and there you are, stuck alone with your beautiful view, he said. I began to resent it.


McDowells tower, so successful in delivering privacy, views of nature and a sense of status, was falling short as a social tool. In short, the building made him less happy.

McDowells story points to one of the greatest challenges of our urbanizing century.

We know that to deal with the pressing issues of our age  population growth, resource scarcity, and climate change  we need to find ways of living that have a lighter footprint. We need to blow less carbon into the atmosphere. We need to succeed using less energy. And we need to make better use of the land we have.

That means learning how to build and live in more dense, connected neighbourhoods and cities. How can we ensure that those sustainable places also make us happy?

Well, psychologists have been telling us for years that the most powerful contributor to human happiness and well-being is not sex, status, money or ice cream. It is the sum total of our positive relationships with other people.

People who are well connected to family, friends and community are not just cheerier then less-connected people. They are healthier. They are more productive. They are more satisfied with their lives. And they live as much as 15 years longer.

For more than half a century, we have been building cities that actually corrode our relationships
So we need to pay attention to the ways that our cities affect our social lives. The evidence from decades of research suggests that urban design influences how we feel and how we behave. Most importantly, it influences our relationships with other people.

The bad news: For more than half a century, we have been building cities that actually corrode our relationships.

Surveys show that people who live in car-dependent neighbourhoods on the edge of big, North American cities are much less likely to trust their neighbours, do favours for them, have them for dinner, volunteer, or even vote, than people who live in older, more walkable neighbourhoods. The more time that people in any given neighbourhood spend commuting, the less likely they are to play team sports, go to community events, or get involved in social groups.

Put simply, long commutes corrode our relationships by stealing our social time. A Swedish study found that people who endure more than a 45-minute commute were actually 40% more likely to divorce.

But theres a problem at the other end the density spectrum as well. The one place where social trust is reported to be as low as the exurban fringe is in the residential tower. For decades, people in towers have complained about being both lonely and crowded at the very same time.

This is true even in Vancouver, where the citys dense, high status, residential downtown has received accolades and admirers from around the globe. The Vancouver Foundation found that people living in towers consistently reported feeling less connected than people living on the ground. They were only half as likely to have done a recent favour for a neighbour. They had more trouble making friends.

The building was built in the style that has come to be known as Vancouverism and exported around the world: a tall, thin tower standing upon a three-story podium
While this is at least partly due to the effect of transience  people move in and out of Vancouvers tower neighbourhoods more frequently  the evidence suggests that buildings can mediate our relationships through design.

Which brings us back to Rob McDowell, the discontented high-rise apartment dweller. McDowells tower, The 501, offers something of a social laboratory.

The building was built in the style that has come to be known as Vancouverism and exported around the world: a tall, thin tower standing upon a three-story podium.

In this case, the City of Vancouver forced the developer to build a row of town houses along that podium base. The front door of each of those townhouses faced a garden and a volleyball court on the buildings third-story rooftop. Early on, McDowell noticed that the town house residents regularly played volleyball and socialized in that garden. He and his tower-living neighbours had every right to join in, but they never did. It was as though, by their proximity, the town house residents owned that space. I just felt left out, he told me.

So McDowell traded his high-status view apartment for one of the town houses. Within weeks his social landscape was transformed. He got to know all his new neighbours. He joined in the weekend cocktail and volleyball sessions in the shared garden.

He felt as if he had come home.

McDowells new neighbours were not inherently more likeable or friendly than his tower neighbours. So what had drawn them together? In some ways, their behaviour was predicted by decades of research into the sociology of place.

Design played a role. The front doors of The 501s town houses all led to small porches a few steps above the podium garden. These porches were a soft zone, where people could hang out and chat without a formal invitation.

Without realizing it, McDowell and his neighbours were testing out a law of social geometry identified by Danish urbanist Jan Gehl. In studying the way people in Denmark and Canada behave in their front yards, Gehl found that residents chat the most with passersby when yards are shallow enough to allow for conversation, but deep enough to allow for retreat. As it turns out, geometry can help us meet our fundamental need to control our interactions with others. If we can chat with neighbours without having to make a date or invite them in for dinner, we actually chat more.

But the social dividends McDowell experienced were also a result of scale. We may be social creatures, but it takes a tremendous amount of brain power to keep track of who we can and cannot trust to be part of our social world. We are constantly making complex yet unconscious trust calculations. The evolutionary anthropologist Robin Dunbar suggested that most of us only have the capacity to keep up with our assessments of about 150 people.

So when McDowell went from bumping into any one of 300 strangers each day in the tower elevator, to regular contact with fewer than two dozen neighbours, his local social world became more manageable. Reaching out to his neighbours at that scale was simply a better investment.

This is not to say that we need to be on friendly terms with all our neighbours. But it offers a clue to why McDowells local social scene suddenly blossomed after he moved down from his own tower.

Nine years later, McDowell told me he could remember the names of everyone who passed his door. These new friendships are not trivial. Now McDowell babysits his neighbours kids and keeps spare keys for their front doors. His fellow town house dwellers dominate the buildings management board. They vacation together. They are supporting his campaign for a seat on city council. He considers half of his 22 town house neighbors to be close friends.

How many of them would you say you love? I asked him the afternoon he showed me around. It was an intrusive question. He blushed, but counted on his fingers.

Love, like they were my family? Six. This is a stunning figure, given the shrinkage that most people report in their social networks over the past 30 years. (The average American reports having two or fewer close confidants, including close family members.)

The lesson for anyone concerned about neighbourliness is that design really matters. We cannot be forced together. The richest social environments are those in which people feel free to edge closer to each other or move apart as we wish. When design offers clusters where we can hive off into smaller groups, we may stand a greater chance of connecting and building those powerful networks of local trust.

This does not mean that we need to stop building apartment towers. Many people thrive in residential towers. But it does mean we need to be more bold and experimental. We need to transcend our lazy reliance on the polar opposites of towers and single-family homes. We need to experiment with all forms of density; from townhouses, to courtyard clusters, to co-housing and other forms weve never seen before.

Cities have, for too long, served to push us apart. But nothing matters more to urban happiness and health than social relationships. We need to build for conviviality.",2/12/2015,govt imposes new taxes of rs4 billi,business

Torontos proposed Quayside community was supposed to be a brag-worthy global showcase for what a smart city, built from the internet up, would look like.

Instead, the joint partnership between Waterfront Toronto and U.S.-based Sidewalk Labs is five months into a 12-month, $50 million negotiation and consultation process. Those involved in Quayside have been surprised by the concerns raised about the project and the resistance to it.


A public meeting last month  only their second in five months  failed to fill in basic details about the nature of the partnership, including how the for-profit Sidewalk Labs would actually generate income from the project.

RELATED STORIES:
Sidewalk Labs advisory panel member Saadia Muzaffar resigns citing 'deep dismay'
Perhaps most surprisingly, officials at the meeting revealed that they were still privately negotiating the most fundamental components of their partnership, namely what data would be collected, who would control and own this data, where it would be stored and how it would be used.

The two sides are also negotiating who will control the intellectual property (IP) that comes from a project that has been designed to produce lots of IP.

Coming to terms with a data-driven world

These are not trivial issues. Smart-city infrastructure requires data collection  in fact, data is best conceived of as the fuel that powers smart cities. Without a constant stream of new data, smart cities cannot be as responsive in delivering public services.

In this respect, Quayside is not unique. Infrastructure projects will increasingly include data components, and municipalities and other levels of government  to say nothing of the citizens whose data these projects will collect  will face challenges similar to those currently encountered by Waterfront Toronto.

Government officials and our fellow citizens can learn a great deal about how not to approach such projects by examining Waterfront Torontos negotiations with Sidewalk Labs.

We suggest three key principles to consider for future smart city infrastructure projects:

1. In data-intensive projects, data is the whole game

Most of the flat-footedness related to the Quayside project to date can be traced back to Waterfront Torontos original request for proposals (RFP). The document treats data instrumentally, focusing on what it can enable rather than treating it as the main product.

There is very little in the RFP that directly references the issue of data control, and the RFP is silent on who will determine what data will be generated. Instead, these and other related issues are left to be determined after the fact, with the RFP requiring only that the Partner will work closely with Waterfront Toronto to ? create the required governance constructs to stimulate the growth of an urban innovation cluster, including legal frameworks (e.g., Intellectual Property, privacy, data sharing) ? deployment testbeds and project monitoring ? reporting requirements and tools to capture data.

2. Set your governance policies in advance

Here, we cannot do better than Bianca Wylie, head of the Open Data Institute Toronto: You dont write policy with a vendor.

By not knowing  or not thinking through  what it wanted on data and IP governance, Waterfront Toronto has left itself to negotiate a deal that has fundamental implications for privacy and data security, and that may lead to de facto privatization of formerly public services.

While issues such as privatization are potentially legitimate policy options, typically they are decided upon before the fact.

3. Focus on data collection, control and use

Everything about data  from the decision to collect it to the way it is used  has a societal impact and therefore requires careful thought. Data-governance policies should, at the very minimum, answer the following questions:

Who controls the decision over what data is generated, its direct and indirect uses, the data itself and the platform through which the data is collected, including access to that platform?

How are decisions about the generation, collection and use of data made?

How will the data be used?

What are the social and economic consequences of these actions?

A national data-governance strategy

Not all of the blame for this situation rests with Waterfront Toronto.

Canada, as others have noted, lacks a data-governance strategy.

As Wylie has remarked in the context of the Quayside project, our entire legislative framework is woefully out of date, and we havent had a national discussion about our data, related public infrastructure, and the degree to which we want big tech influencing our governance and public services.

Nonetheless, Waterfront Toronto should have set their data-governance demands in advance, and then sought out vendors. Much of the resulting confusion about Quayside can be traced to this initial mistake.

Fortunately, this is a learning opportunity for other governments. Almost everything government does now has a data component. This understanding must be built into their procurement prior to engaging with vendors.

Better yet, governments should create an overarching data governance plan and use that to guide interactions with various stakeholders. The stakes are too high to leave such consequential policies to chance.",2/12/2015,oil prices rise in asian trad,business
