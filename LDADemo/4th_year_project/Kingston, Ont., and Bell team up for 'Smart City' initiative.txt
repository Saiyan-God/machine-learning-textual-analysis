KINGSTON, Ont. — A southeastern Ontario city says it is teaming up with Bell Canada to implement new technology that will monitor certain municipal operations in what it’s calling a “Smart City” program.

The project will collect and organize data from internet-connected items to help the city of Kingston, Ont., keep track of things like energy use.

A joint statement from Kingston and Bell says the project will help the city make better informed decisions on matters like municipal operations and infrastructure.

Kingston says the first two parts of its Smart City program will roll out this spring.

The city will introduce digital kiosks that provide Wi-Fi access, real-time event updates and charging services, as well as 911 emergency buttons among other features.


The city will also begin closely monitoring energy data, which it says will help reduce carbon emissions and meet municipal environmental targets. It says it will also help the city better co-ordinate maintenance.

Kingston and Bell note that the federal government announced $300 million in funding for Smart Cities over 11 years in its 2017 budget.

“This partnership with Bell will create cutting-edge technology for us and put Kingston on the map as being one of the most innovative cities in Canada,” said city mayor Bryan Paterson said in a statement.

Bell says the project will help the city transform its operations “within months” of being implemented
