LIGHT TANK M3 SERIES
LIGHT TANK, M3, standardized in
July, 1940, and produced in quantity beginning
in March, 19-11, was supplied to
our Allies, under Lend-Lease, as well as to
our own Army through 1941 and 1942 .
Nicknamed the "General Stuart" by
British troops, these tanks won high
praise during the Libyan campaign, and
are now considered obsolete only because
of the great improvements in later vehicles .
Based on Light Tank, M2A4, but using
heavier armor and incorporating other improvements,
Light Tank, M3, for its day,
was heavily armed and armored and provided
a high standard of mechanical
reliability .
Through the production period, numerous
improvements were made, so that the
final M3s were vastly different from the
first . First models were entirely riveted,
with a seven-sided turret . Later a welded,
seven-sided turret was used, and still
later, a rounded, welded, homogeneous
turret. The final models were entirely
welded .
The volute spring suspension is used,
with the rear idler "trailing" on ground
level, rather than "mounted" above the
ground as on Light Tank, M2A4 . This
lengthens the ground contact of the track,
thus decreasing the pressure per square
inch, and gives additional support to the
rear of the tank .
Power is supplied by a 7-cylinder Continental
W670-9A gasoline engine . Some
models of Light Tanks, M3 and M3A1,
were powered by a Guiberson T1020-4
Diesel engine . A synchromesh transmission
provides five forward speeds and one
reverse.
The driver and assistant driver occupy
seats in the hull, with vision ahead through
hatches equipped with windshields . In
combat areas, the armored hatch cover
may be closed, whereupon vision is possible
through a protectoscope, a form of
periscope.
The gunner and commander-loader occupy
seats in the turret, which may be
traversed through 360° by a hand-operated
mechanism. Entrance to the turret is
through the cupola hatch, which also provides
an observation post for the commander.
In noncombat areas, the commander
may operate with his head and

shoulders above the cupola. In danger
zones, vision from the cupola is through
pistol ports equipped with protectoscopes.
(Early models used direct vision "peepholes"
instead .)
Principal armament is a 37 mm gun,
M5 or M6, mounted with a cal. .30
machine gun in a combination mount in
the turret. The turret guns have elevations
from -10 ° to +20°. An A.P.C. projectile,
fired from the 37 mm gun, has a
muzzle velocity of 2,900 feet per second .
It has a maximum range of 12,850 yards,
and will penetrate 1 .8-inch face-hardened
armor plate at 1,000 yards .
Late models are provided with a gyrostabilizer
to increase the accuracy of aiming
and firing the turret guns when the
vehicle is in motion.
Other armament includes a cal . .30
machine gun, in the bow, one on the turret
for antiaircraft use, and -one in each
sponson.
Normal fuel capacity of 56 gallons may
be increased when necessary by the use of
two 25-gallon jettison fuel tanks. These
can be abandoned upon entering a combat
zone . The vehicle is equipped with a
two-way radio .
Light Tanks, M3 and M3 (Diesel),
were declared obsolete by Ordnance Committee
action in July, 1943. These and
later vehicles of the Light Tank, M3,
Series, were built by the American Car
and Foundry Co.
LIGHT TANK, M3AI, was standardized
in August, 1941, as a modification of
Light Tank, M3 . It was declared obsolete
in July 1944 .
The turret is similar to that used in the
final version of Light Tank, M3, but omits
the cupola. A fighting compartment is integrated
with the turret and is rotated
with it, either by a hydraulic mechanism
or by hand . This compartment contains
seats for the gunner and commanderloader
as well as the traversing and gyrostabilizer
mechanisms and ammunition .
An improved Combination Gun Mount,
M23, for the turret guns has a periscopic
sight. An additional periscope, with 360 °
traverse, is provided in the turret roof .
Other armament is the same as on Light
Tank, M3, except that the sponson guns
are omitted.
The vehicle is equipped with an improved
radio and with an interphone

is extended forward and reinforced, providing
more space and greater safety for
the driver and assistant . The drivers'
hatches, formerly in the front plate, are
relocated in the top plate and equipped
with periscopes to provide indirect vision
in combat zones. Three additional periscopes
are provided in the turret .
Sponsons are lengthened to the rear of
the vehicle and contain additional gasoline
tanks as well as additional ammunition
storage. Sand shields are provided
over the suspensions. A storage box is
located at the rear .
Other improvements include easier
steering, improved fire protection and
ventilation, relocation of battery, switch
and instruments and provision of detachable
head lamps and a detachable windshield
and weather cover.
The redesigned Combination Gun
Mount, M44, includes a telescope which
may be used through all degrees of gun

LIGHT TANKS M5 LIMITED STANDARD-MSAI SUBSTITUTE STANDARD
LIGHT TANK, M5, standardized in
February, 1942, was designed as a modification
of Light Tank, M3A 1, to use twin
Cadillac engines and Hydra-Matic transmissions,
providing automatic gear shifting.
It was reclassified as Limited Standard
in April, 1943.
The hull is fabricated of welded, homogeneous
armor plate with the reinforced
front plate, extended sponsons, and
streamlined effect subsequently adopted
for Light Tank, M3A3 . Elimination of
bolts and rivets reduced the danger of
having these parts driven inside the tank
by the impact of projectiles on the exterior .
The welded, power-operated turret and
integrated turret basket are similar to
those used on Light Tank, M3AI. However,
because of the lower driveshaft tunnel
required by the use of the Cadillac
engines and Hydra-Matic transmissions,
it was possible to relocate the turrettraversing
mechanism and portions of the
gun stabilizer under the turret basket,
thus providing more space in the fighting
compartment.
The turret, of welded, curved-plate
armor plate, is covered on the front by a
LIGHT TANK, M5, WITH PISTOL PORTS AND HATCHES CLOSED; HULL AND TURRET PERISCOPES UP ; GROUSERS ON SIDE OF TURRET

heavy armor-plate casting which serves as
a base for the combination gun mount .
The turret can be rotated through a
traverse of 360 ° either by a hydraulic
mechanism or by hand.
Principal armament is a 37 mm Gun,
M6, mounted with a cal. .30 Browning
machine gun, in the turret. Elevation is
from -10° to +20° . An A.P.C. projectile,
when fired from the 37 mm gun, has a
muzzle velocity of 2,900 feet per second .
It has a maximum range of 12,850 yards,
and will penetrate 1.8 inches of facehardened
armor plate at 1,000 yards .
A gyrostabilizer is provided to keep the
turret gun sufficiently close to a fixed
elevation while the tank is in motion over
normal terrain so that the gunner can
accurately aim and fire the gun.
The two 8-cylinder, 90°, V-type, liquidcooled
Cadillac engines are located in the
rear of the hull . The flywheel end of each
engine is connected to a Hydra-Matic
transmission . These transmissions, plus a
two-speed stepdown in the transfer unit,
provide six forward speeds and one
reverse speed.
An auxiliary power plant consisting of
a generating set powered by a singlecylinder
gasoline engine supplements the
engine generators for charging the battery .
Seats for the driver and assistant driver
are adjustable horizontally or vertically .
Seats go up under spring pressure and

down under body weight and can be
locked in any position .
The vehicle is provided with dual controls
and has four escape hatches, one for
each member of the crew. It is equipped
with 360° periscopes for the driver, assistant
driver, and commander and a periscopic
gun sight, as well as with three
protectoscopes in the turret ports . Two
knockout plugs cover ports in the front
armor plate . The tank is wired for radio
and for an interphone system .

LIGHT TANK, MSAI, was standardized
in September, 1942, and replaced
Light Tank, M5, in production. It was
reclassified as Substitute Standard in
July, 1944.
Principal change was in the use of an
improved turret with a radio bulge at the
rear,, similar to the turret of Light Tank,
M3A3. The improved turret provides
more room for turret crew members and
permits desirable rearrangements in stowage.
A radio antenna bracket is mounted
above the bulge . A removable plate in the
rear of the bulge permits removal of the
37 mm gun.
The antiaircraft gun mount is improved
,,MANUAL CONH OL CRAN!< :

ADJUSTABLE SEATS AND CONTROLS IN TURRET BASKET
and repositioned to the right side of the
turret. Dual traverse is incorporated, permitting
the commander to traverse the
turret while firing the antiaircraft gun .
Larger escape hatches, with improved
positive water-sealing door latches, are
provided, and there is an additional
escape hatch for emergency use in the
floor of the hull .
The improved Combination Gun
Mount, M44, for the turret guns, incorporates
a direct-sighting 3-power telescope.
The breech guard permits hinging
upward, facilitating travel from one seat
to another by personnel. A new mount for
the commander's periscope permits 360°
traverse . An additional periscope in the
turret facilitates rear vision for the commander.
Pistol port doors are redesigned and
relocated, and equipped with locking
devices . A direction finder fastened to the
turret roof ahead of the commander's
periscope indicates the straight ahead
position . A spotlight is provided .
Sand shields, which extend down from
the sponsons and cover the top portion of
the track, are supplied when required .
Pilot models for Light Tanks, M5 and
M5A1, were manufactured by the Cadillac
Motor Car Division, General Motors Corp .

MEDIUM TANK M3 SERIES
These were the first Auterican inediunt
tanks produced in quantity under the
defense program prior to the entry of I lie.
United States into World War II . Supplied
to the British and Russians as Lend- Lease
materiel, they compared favorably with
other medium tanks at that time.
They were the first of our tanks to
employ 75--mm guns, gyrostabilizers, and
power-traversed turrets with integral fighting
compartments. Their armor was
thicker than that of our earlier tanks .
Battle experience in Africa and Russia
suggested improvements, some of which
were introduced as production continued .
Most of the improvements, however, were
incorporated in the design of Medium
Tank M4. When the latter was standardized
in October 1941, tanks of the M3
series were designated Substitute Standard.
In April 1943 they were reclassified
as Limited Standard, and in April 1944
they were declared obsolete .
MEDIUM TANK M3-This was the
original vehicle of the series. It had a
riveted hull and was powered by a Continental
(Wright) R-975-EC2 or R-975-
C1 gasoline engine .
MEDIUM TANK M3A7-This was similar
to Medium Tank M3 but had a cast
hull .
MEDIUM TANK M3A2-This was similar
to Medium Tank M3 but had a welded
hull .
MEDIUM TANK M3A3-This was similar
to Medium Tank M3A2, with a welded
hull, but was powered by twin General
Motors 6-71 Diesel engines .
MEDIUM TANK M3A4-This was similar
to Medium Tank M3, with a riveted
hull, but was powered by a Chrysler
multibank engine .
MEDIUM TANK WAS-This was similar
to Medium Tank M3, with a riveted
hull, but was powered by twin General
Motors 6-71 Diesel engines .
Principal armament was a 75-mm Gun
M3, in a rotor mount in the right front
of the crew compartment. This gun had
an elevation from -9° to +20° and could
be traversed 15 ° in each direction . The
gun could be fired manually or electrically .
The A.P.C. projectile M61, fired from
this gun with a muzzle velocity of 1,920
feet per second, has a maximum range of
13,090 yards and will penetrate 2 .9 inches
of face-hardened armor plate at 1,000
yards.
A 37-mm Gun M6 and a Cal . .30 Machine
Gun M1919A4 were mounted in a
Combination Gun Mount M24, in the
turret, which had a traverse of 360 ° . The
turret guns were fired electrically and
had elevations from -7° to +60°. The

MEDIUM TANK, M4, WITH WELDED HULL AND SAND SHIELDS. 75 MM AND CAL. .30 GUNS ARE IN COMBINATION GUN MOUNT, M34A1
These medium tanks, nicknamed "General
Shermans" by British troops, have
played an important part in Allied victories
in Africa, Sicily and Russia ever
since they first helped rout Marshal Rommel's
troops at El Alamein .
Standardized' in October, 1941, they
introduced a number of improvements
over the Medium Tank, M3, Series, which
they replaced in production .
The 75 mm gun was relocated in the
turret, providing 360° traverse and
greater elevation and depression than was
possible in Medium Tank, .M13 The silhouette
was lowered by the elimination
of the cupola, thus making the tank a less
conspicuous target and also resulting in a
lowered center of gravity, making the
tank more stable . The 37 mm gun was
eliminated. The crew was decreased to
five, including an assistant driver .
The 75 mm gun breech was turned 90 °
from the vertical, allowing for easy righthand
loading. The radio was relocated in

a turret "bulge." Greater comfort and
safety were provided for all crew members .
Produced simultaneously by different
manufacturers, the various models differ
from each other principally in their
engines . A further difference is that the
M4A1 has a cast hull, whereas the others
have welded hulls . In addition, the M4A5,
produced in Canada, embodies differences
requested by the Canadian government .
All have cast turrets .
Principal armament (except for the
M4A5) is a 75 mm Gun, M3, mounted
with a cal . .30 machine gun in a combination.
gun mount in the turret . The turret
guns may be elevated from -10° to
+25° . They are fired electrically by means
of foot and hand switches. A gyrostabilizer
is provided .
An A.P.C . projectile, fired from the 75
mm gun, has a muzzle velocity of 2,030
feet per second, and will penetrate 3 .1
inches of face-hardened armor plate at
1,000 yards .
Other armament includes a cal . .30
machine gun in the bow, operated by the
assistant driver ; a cal . .50 machine gun,
mounted at the top of the turret, operated
by the commander for antiaircraft use,
and a 2-inch smoke mortar . A clip is

mounted in the turret to carry a cat .45
submachine gun, which can he used
through the pistol port in the side of the
turret .
The turret is a one-piece casting of
armor which rotates on a ball bearing race
recessed and protected against direct hits
and lead splash from enemy fire . The
turret basket is rigidly fastened to the
turret by means of a ring of bolts around
its circumference . The turret hatch ring
acts as antiaircraft gun mount .
The driver sits at the left bow of the
tank. The assistant driver sits at the
right bow . The loader sits in the turret,
to the left of the 75 mm gun, and the
gunner to its right . The tank commander
sits in the rear of the turret, behind the
gunner. Adjustable seats, allowing 12
inches of movement up and down and 5
inches fore and aft, are provided for the
gunner, driver and assistant driver.
Access to the tank is through two
hatches in the bow and a revolving hatch
in the turret . An emergency escape hatch
is located in the tank floor, behind the
assistant driver.
Indirect vision is provided for each
member of the crew by means of periscopes.
The gunner's periscope is synchronized
with the gun, contains a telescopic
sight, and changes its line of sight
only if the gun is elevated or depressed or
the turret rotated . All other periscopes are
mounted so that they can be tilted up or
down and rotated through 360 °. Early
models had direct vision slots, protected
by thick glass plates and hinged covers,
for the driver and assistant driver . Because
of their vulnerability to bullet
splash, these were eliminated in later
production, and additional periscopes
were provided .
The transmission has five forward
speeds and one reverse speed . A parking
brake is built into the' transmission . The

controlled differential transmits engine
power to the final drive unit, and contains
a brake system for steering and stopping
the vehicle . The final drive units transmit
power from the controlled differential to
the hub of the driving sprockets through
a set of reduction gears . The entire power
train can be removed from the vehicle
when necessary.
Six 2-wheeled, rubber-tired bogies or
suspensions, bolted to the hull, support
the vehicle on volute springs . The tracks
are driven by sprockets on the front of
the vehicle . Two idlers are mounted on
eccentric shafts at the rear end of the
hull, and provide for adjustment of the
track tension. The weight of the upper
portion of the track is carried by tracksupporting
rollers. (Some vehicles have
the track-support roller directly over the
suspension bracket. A second type has the
roller offset to the rear of the bracket and
is fitted with a track skid on top of the
bracket.)
Two fixed 10-lb . fire extinguishers are
provided in the engine compartment, and
may be operated from the driver's scat or
from outside the tank . Portable 4-lb . fire
extinguishers are provided in the driver's
compartment and in the turret.
The tank is equipped with a two-way
radio and an interphone system . An
auxiliary generator provides additional
current at times of unusual drain, and
may also be used in preheating the engine
compartment in cold weather.
The pilot tank, designated Medium
Tank, T6, was built at Aberdeen Proving
Ground, and had a cast hull . The vehicle
had an entrance hatch at the side and had
two additional machine guns in the bow,
which were eliminated from the production
tanks .
A number of changes were made during
production, with the result that newer
vehicles differ somewhat from those
produced earlier.
The original Combination Gun Mount,
M34, had a front shield which protected
the 75 mm gun only . Ordnance Committee
action in October, 1942, standardized
Combination Gun Mount, M34A1, a
modification which incorporated a direct
sighting telescope. This mount may be
recognized by its front shield which protects
the Cal . .30 machine gun and the
direct sighting telescope, as well as the
75 mm gun. It has two "ears" projecting
a few inches over the 75 mm gun .
The lower front plate of the hull on
early models consisted of three pieces,
bolted together . Later production vehicles
used a one-piece plate .
Introduction of sand shields over the
suspensions, and of water-protected ammunition
chests, were among other changes
on later vehicles .

MEDIUM TANKS M4 (105 MM HOW.), M4A3 (105 MM HOW.) STANDARD
These nIodifica .tions of \Tedium 'I"ank~,
1\14 and 1\14A3, were designed to combine
the firepower of a 105 n1m lniwiticr
with the performance characteristics of a
medium tank. They arc supplied iii addition
to the medium tanks with 75 111111
guns authorized by Tables of Basic
Allowances, and to replace the 75 lum
Howitzer Motor Carriages, M8, in Battalion
Headquarters Companies, Medium
Tank Battalions .
The 105 mm Howitzer, M4, is mounted
in a Combination Gun Mount, M52, with
one cal. .30 Machine Gun, M1919A4,
flexible, in a 360° hand-traversed turret .
No gyrostabilizer is provided . The howitzer
is a redesign of 105 mm Howitzer,
M2A1.
Other armament is the same as for
Medium Tanks, M4, and M4A3.
The cast turret has a partial turret
basket. A fighting seat for the gunner, a
convoy seat for the tank commander and
a riding seat for the loader are provided .
All seats traverse with the turret.
A commander's vision cupola is provided
above the turret . Equipped with
six prismatic vision blocks, of 3 inch,
laminated, bullet-resisting glass, it affords
a wide field of view .
There is a suitable floor over the
stowage space on either side of the power
tunnel. Pistol ports and lifting hooks are
the same as for Medium Tanks, M4, and
padding and safety belts are furnished
wherever required. A pintle for towing
an ammunition trailer is provided .
Construction of two pilot Medium
Tanks, M4A4, mounting the 105 mm
howitzer, was authorized by Ordnance
Committee action in December, 1942.
Designated Medium Tank, M4A4E1, the
vehicle was tested at Aberdeen Proving
Ground and at Fort Knox, Ky . Modifications
deemed necessary were incorporated
in new pilot models designated Medium
Tank, M4E5. Standardization of the
vehicles was approved in August, 1943 .

MEDIUM AND HEAVY TANK ENGINES (Continued)
The variety of medium tank engines
shown here is a tribute to the resourcefulness
of American industry, in cooperation
with the Ordnanct_ Department, in
meeting an emergency.
When the program for the quantity
production of medium tanks was inaugurated
in 1940, it became necessary to find
sources of sufficient engines. Medium Tank
M3 used the Continental (Wright)R-975
engine, an aircraft, type of engine adapted
for use in tank ~i; . tlium Tank M3 (Diesel)
used the Guiberson T-1400 Diesel engine,
but only a few of these were built .
To avoid conflicting with the Air Forces,
whose need " for engines was equally imperative,
efforts were made to adapt commercial
truck and passenger car engines,
already in production, for use in tanks .
First such engine authorized for use as
an alternate power plant was the G.M.
6046 Diesel engine, made up of two stand-

and bus and truck type engines . In the
medium tank installation, the engines,
located one on either side of the engine
compartment, are connected through a
step-up gear and double clutch housing
to a common propeller shaft . Originally
authorized for use in Medium Tank 1M13A3
by Ordnance Committee action in December
1941, these engines are now used in
Medium Tank M4A2 and in vehicles
based on these tanks .
The Chrysler A-57 power unit consists
of five conventional passenger car engines,
geared together to operate as a
single unit . Originally authorized for use
in Medium Tank M3A4, it was used subsequently
in Medium Tank M4A4.
The Ford GAA engine is an 8-cylinder,
V-type engine designed specifically for
tanks. It was introduced in Medium Tank
M4A3 by Ordnance Committee action in
January 1942. A modification known as
TYPICAL CHARACTERISTICS
the Ford GAN engine is being used in
Medium "Tank T23_ Virtually the same
engine, known as model GAF, is used in
t ica,vy Tank T26E3 .
Ordnance Committee action in May
1943 authorized the use of the RD-1820
Ordnance engine in Medium Tank M4A4
hulls, and designated this vehicle Medium
Tank M4A6. This engine was formerly
known as the Caterpillar D-200A engine.
Heavy Tanks M6 and M6A1 use Wright
G-200 series engines, Model 781C9GC1 .
Heavy Tank T1E1, sometimes referred
to as the M6A2, uses a modification of
this engine, designated Model 795C9GC1,
which is directly coupled to an electric
generator.

Motor Carriage M7, which helped rout
Rommel in Libya.
All are lightly-armored, open-top
vehicles in which a 105-mm howitzer is
the pri1 armament. The pulpitlike
appearance of the machine gun compartment
caused the M7 to be nicknamed
"The Priest" by British troops .

M2A1 mounted at the front of the
crew compartment . The howitzer can be
elevated from -5° to +35° and can be
traversed 30° to the right and 15 ° to the
left. An HE shell, fired from this howitzer,
has a muzzle velocity of 1,550 feet per
second at an elevation of 44 ° and a
maximum range of 12,205 yards .
A Cal. .50 Machine Gun M2 HB (flexible)
on a ring mount is provided for use
against low-flying aircraft . Provision is
made for 3 cal . .45 submachine guns .

by i2-in. armor at the front, sides,
and rear, and is open at the top . The
upper portion of the side and rear armor
is hinged and held in position by lock
pins. Grip handles, which serve as ladders
leading to the crew compartment, are
at both sides of the vehicle .
Direct vision for the driver is through a
removable windshield and indirect vision
through a protectoscope . The vehicle has
five speeds forward and one reverse, the
maximum speed being 24 m .p .h .

HALF-TRACK PERSONNEL CARRIERS M3, M3A1 LIMITED STANDARD
HALF-TRACK CAR M3AZ STANDARD
Half-Track Car M2 and Half-Track Personnel Carrier M3, the
basic half-track vehicles, were standardized in 1940 and
used throughout 1941 and 1942 . With the addition of ring
mounts for antiaircraft use and with other modifications, their
designations were changed to M2A1 and M3A1 respectively .
All of these vehicles are now classified as Limited Standard and
will be replaced in production by Half-Track Car M3A2.
Consisting, of a specially designed, commercial-type, frontand-
rear drive truck chassis with an armored hull, the halftrack
vehicle can attain a maximum road 'speed of 40 m .p .h .
Because of its endless-band track-laying rear drive, however,
it can be used over rough terrain . It will cross ditches which are
not sufficiently deep to cause the front or rear to become embedded
. Some models are provided with a roller at the front
to assist in climbing out of ditches . On other models, the roller
is replaced by a winch for use in towing the vehicle out of soft
terrain .
The body is protected by Y4-in . armor at the sides and rear.
Top and side protection is given the engine by the armored
hood. The radiator is protected by armored shutters which can

be opened or closed or set in three intermediate positions from
within the driver's compartment . The windshield is of shatterproof
glass .
For further protection, a Y2-in . armored shield is hinged
above the windshield frame, held open by three supports, and
additional armored shields are hinged to the doors . In combat
zones, the windshield can be removed and these shields swung
into place . They are provided with direct-vision slots .
The detachable top is of canvas and is supported by three
removable bows and the windshield frame . Removable side
curtains with transparent windows also are provided. Mine
racks are mounted on the sides of late production models .
Power is supplied by a White 160AX gasoline engine .
HALF-TRACK CAR M2-LIMITED STANDARD, has seats for
a crew of ten . A skate rail surrounds the interior of the vehicle .
By the use of two carriage mounts, a cal . .30 and a cal . .50
machine gun can be moved along this rail and fired in any
direction .
This vehicle can be used as a prime mover for the 105-mm
howitzer.

HAILF-TRACK CAR M2A1-LIMITED STANDARD, is similar
to the M2 but has an M49 ring mount for cal . .50 machine gun
over the assistant driver's seat . By use of this mount the cal .
.50 1113 machine gun can be traversed 360 ° from a single position,
permitting rapid fire against low-flying aircraft as well as
against ground targets . It can be elevated from -15 ° to +85° .
Three fixed pintle sockets are mounted, one on each side
and one on the rear of the body, permitting the use of a cal .
.30 machine gun .
HALF-TRACK PERSONNEL CARRIER M3-LIMITED STANDARD,,
is generally similar to the M2 but has seating accommodations
for 13 men . The body is about 10 inches longer than
on the M2 and has a door at the rear. Instead of a skate rail,
the vehicle has an M25 pedestal mount for a cal . .30 machine
gun, which is secured to the floor of the, personnel compartment .

TYPICAL STOWAGE ARRANGEMENT OF HALF-TRACK CAR M3A2
This half-track, with modifications, is used as the chassis for
several gun motor carriages .
HALF-TRACK PERSONNEL CARRIER M3A1-LIMITED
STANDARD, is similar to the M3 but has an M49 ring mount
for a cal . .50 machine gun over the assistant driver's seat .
Three pintle sockets are mounted, one on each side and one
on the rear of the body .
HALF-TRACK CAR M3A2-STANDARD, is a modification
of the Half-Track Personnel Carrier M3A1 designed to take
the place of Half-Track Personnel Carriers M3 and M3A1, and
Half-Track Cars M2 and M2A1 .
Variations in stowage arrangements, through the use of suit
able boxes, give the vehicle a variety of uses . Crews range fron
5 to 12 men, depending on the amount of stowage carried ant
the tactical purpose intended .
Normally the vehicle mounts one cal . .50 machine gun o
one cal. .30 machine gun, together with the required vehicula
accessories, tools, spare parts, and equipment which are provide
for all half-tracks . Under such circumstances, a crew of 12 ca
be carried . Three pintle sockets are provided to accommodat
additional machine guns when authorized.
When the vehicles carry special loadings or have radic
installed, personnel are displaced . As an example, if an SCR-50
radio is installed, the crew is reduced by two men .
The basic vehicle is equipped to stow and carry 330 rounc
of cal . .50 ammunition and 2,000 rounds of cal . .30 ammunitiol
When used as a machine gun squad carrier, however, addition,
ammunition is carried in place of two of the seat position
When used by a heavy machine gun squad armed with wate
cooled machine guns, these guns and their accessories are sul
stituted for the air-cooled cal . .30 machine gun .

1/4-TON, 4X4, TRUCK STANDARD
This vehicle, popularly called the "peep
is one of the outstanding automotive
developments of this war . I)eveloped by
the Quartermaster Corps, it and other
motor transport vehicles were transferred
to the Ordnance Department in August,
1942.
It has been found useful in a variety
of ways, and despite its light weight has
been able to function under rigorous conditions.
Operated by a crew of two, it
has a space for equipment or additional
personnel.
The truck is capable of operation over
unimproved roads, trails, and open, rolling,
and hilly cross country. It will climb
a 60% grade, and will operate at a speed
of 65 m.p .h. on level highways . It can
ford a stream 18 inches deep, while fully
equipped and loaded. It has a cruising
range of approximately 300 miles on 15
gallons of gasoline .
Towing a 37 mm antitank gun, it will
climb a 7% grade, and can achieve a s
of 20 m.p .h. on a level highway.
Power is supplied by a four-cylinder
L head gasoline engine equipped with a
counter-balanced crankshaft. The clutch
is a single-plate, dry-disk type. The
transmission is of the three-speed, syncromesh
type, which, through a transfer
case, provides six speeds forward and
two reverse.
The vehicle has internal-expanding, hydraulic
four-wheel brakes and a mechanical
handbrake.
A base plate is provided for a pedestal
mount for a cal . .30 or a cal . .50 machine
gun. The infantry uses the Cal . .30
Machine Gun Mount, M48, on the dash,
and other arms use the Pedestal Truck
Mount, M31 .
Provision is made for a lighting socket
connection for a trailer, and for a radio
outlet. The windshield may be folded
down over the hood when desired . A removable
canvas top is provided .
Desert equipment includes a radiator
surge tank, a power-driven air compressor,
a low-pressure tire gage, a 3-inch copper
fin radiator, and a fuel filter, relocated to
minimize vapor lock .
A tandem hitch makes it possible to use
two of these vehicles for emergency towing
of a 155 mm howitzer . When used in
this way, speed is limited to 30 m .p .h .
on level highway, and 10 m .p.h. down
hill .
The vehicles are produced, to identical
specifications, by the Willys-Overland
Motors, Inc ., and the Ford Motor Co.

OF ORDNANCE
The 37 mm guns are the lightest weapons
of the field-gun type used in the
U.S. Army. The original 37 mm gun supplied
to the U .S . Army in 1917-18 was
the M1916, of French design . It was a
comparatively low-velocity weapon not
suited for antitank employment .
The 37 mm Gun, M1916, is classified as
Limited Standard for manufacture, but
as Standard for issue, with its cradle,
as subcaliber equipment . The Carriages,
M1916, M1916A1 and M1916A2 are also
Limited Standard.
The desirability of a light, highly mobile
antitank gun, using armor-piercing
and high-explosive shells, resulted in the
production of the 37 mm antitank
materiel whose design features closely resemble
the German Rheinmetall weapon .
The 37 mm Antitank Gun, M3, represents
the most powerful piece that has
been manufactured to weigh less than
1,000 pounds . Recent developments in
ammunition have increased the muzzle
velocity from 2,600 feet per second to
2,900 feet per second, with consequently
greater armor penetration .
uultawwwwuwwuupwwtu OMMMM 15 JANUARY 1944
5,
1.
GUN, M3--'l'he rifle(! barrel is a 011(1-
piece forging threaded to screw into aa
breech ring recessed for a vertically sliding
block which is operated manually . The
recoil system is of the hydrospring type,
including a buffer mechanism which prevents
possible damage to the weapon due
to sudden stopping of the recoiling parts .
The estimated life of the gun at normal
pressure is approximately 2,500 rounds .
GUN, M3AI-Addition of gas deflectors
to the M3 gun changed its designation
to M3A1 . These gas deflectors
were subsequently removed, but all 37
mm, M3, guns with muzzles threaded for
gas deflectors are now designated M3A1 .
CARRIAGE, M4-This carriage has a
split trail and pneumatic tires . It can be
towed by a prime mover on roads or across
country, and by its crew. Elevating and
traversing mechanisms are attached to
the mount. Adjustments in traverse are
normally made by the use of the traversing
handwheel, although a traversing release
handle allows rapid changes in
traverse through free movement of the
gun. The handle must be held in position
during free traverse, for on release of the
handle the gun is automatically locked to
the traversing mechanism.
37 MM ANTITANK GUN M3A1--CARRIAGE M4A1 (Continued)
In order to increase stability of the gun
during firing, wheel segments which swing
on the axle raise the tires off the ground .
The segments are locked in both travel
and firing positions by a handle-actuated
plunger .
The Telescope, M6, is held in position
by the Telescope Mount, M19, which is
attached to the gun carriage by means of
a bracket, assuring movement of the sight
with the gun during traverse .
While a 37 mm gun squad consists of
six men, the Carriage, M4, is designed for
one-man control of aiming, elevating,
traversing and firing .
Carriage, M4, is classified as Limited
Standard .
CARRIAGE, M4AI-This carriage is
identical with the Carriage, M4, except
that for quick adjustment of the gun in
traverse a release mechanism permits traverse
to be effected by pressure of the
right shoulder and arm against the shoulder
traversing bar so long as the traversing

British battle experience indicated the
need for a light gun more powerful
than the 2-pounder (37 mm) which could
be employed as an antitank weapon or
be mounted in a tank or gun motor carriage.
This requirement was met by the
6-pounder gun, standardized in America
for Lend-Lease manufacture as the 57
mm Gun, Ml .
O.C.M: . 16489, dated 20 February
1941, authorized the preparation of drawings
of the British 6-pounder gun, carriage
and on-carriage fire control equipment
converted to American gears, threads and
tolerances. On 15 May 1941, O .C.M.
16722 recommended standardization of
the British-American 57 mm materiel as
Gun, M1, Carriage, M1, Telescope, M18,
and Telescope Mount, M24 .
Modifications were made to the M1
Carriage which culminated in the present
Carriage, M1A3. These changes included
substitution of free traverse for gear
traverse, and new lunette, drawbar, and
trail lock assemblies .

In 1917 the A.E .F. in France and certain
regiments in the United States were
equipped with the French 75 mm M1897
gun as the standard for light field artillery
materiel. The performance of this
gun in battle was such that it was considered
the most effective light field gun used
in World War I . A considerable number
of these guns were purchased from France,
while similar guns were manufactured in
the United States. The parts of the American
and French manufactured guns are
identical and interchangeable .
As mounted on modernized carriages
which may be towed at any speed, the
75 mm gun is today a far more formidable
weapon than was its counterpart in the
last war. New ammunition, including
armor-piercing projectiles, has been developed
to give greatly increased range .
These guns are now being withdrawn from
service to be placed on self-propelled
mounts. No further production of these
guns has been undertaken .

are of built-up construction with

3 INCH ANTITANK GUN M5
nadeyuacy of existing antitank guns
when opposed by Heavily armored
vehicles resulted, in September, 1940, in
the preparation of specifications for a
3° gun sufficiently powerful to destroy
the most formidable tanks then in use .
It was recommended that a gun be constructed
to combine the 3 inch antiaircraft
gun tube, T9, the 105 mm breechblock,
and the 105 mm Howitzer Carriage,
M2 . This gun and its carriage were
standardized in December, 1941, as 3
Inch Antitank Gun, M5, and Carriage,
M1. Further-tests by the Tank Destroyer
Command resulted in the adoption of the
M5 gun and M1 carriage as a standard
antitank weapon late in 1942 . In 1943 the
M1 Carriage was modified and designated .
3 Inch Gun Carriage, M6. This carriage
is now Standard .

a long-barreled tube, a modified breech

A The Map r development in 105 mm
howitzer uiatcriel has been in carriage
design . The present Carriage, M2A2,
capable of transport at speeds up to
thirty-five miles an hour, is a modification
of the Carriage, M1, designed for
draft by horses or slow tractors .
The 105 mm Howitzer, M2A1, is also
mounted on the self-propelled motor
carriage, M7, and the medium tanks, M4
and M4A3.
HOWITZERS, M2 AND M2A1-Possession
of the same general characteristics
makes these howitzers interchangeable .
The only difference between the two
models is in the design of their breech
rings . A sliding-type breechblock is used
with either howitzer. The piece is fired by
a lanyard attached to a firing mechanism
on the cradle .
CARRIAGE, M2-The M2 carriage has
a split trail, pneumatic-tired disk and rim
wheels, and brakes operated from the
driver's seat of the prime mover .
The unbalanced weight of the howitzer
is neutralized by a single-unit, springtype
equilibrator . The elevating arcs
serve as a seat for the trunnions of the
carriage. The elevating mechanism on
the cradle may be operated from either
side of the carriage. The axle and the

The present S" howitzer used by the
U. S. Army is the Ml, a development
from the Howitzers, Mk . VI, Mk. VII
and Mk. VIII-Y2 issued to the A .E .F . during
the first World War. These howitzers
were manufactured in both England and
the United States . While they differ in
certain respects, they have the same types
of breechblocks and firing mechanisms.
8 INCH HOWITZER, MK. VI-This
howitzer is mounted on the Mk . VI carriage
. The barrel is of built-up construction,
consisting of a jacket shrunk on over
a tube. A shrunk-on breech ring carries a
lug for connecting the gun to the recoil
mechanism. A breech bushing is provided
for reception of a lever-operated breechblock
of the interrupted-screw type having
an asbestos obturator pad in the
mushroom head . Two types of noninterchangeable
firing mechanisms are utilized .
In one a T-tube friction primer inserted
in the breech is fired by means of a lanyard
pulling a friction wire out of the
tube. The other type is of the percussion
variety, in which a percussion primer fitting
into the breechblock is fired by a
lanyard-operated hammer striking a firing

pin . Fruit and rear guide rings support
the howitzer m the cradle . This howitzer
is classife I as Limited Standard .
8 INCH HOWITZER, MK. VII This
howitzer, of wire-wound construction,
was superseded by the Mk . VIII-% because
it was found necessary to thicken
the powder chamber walls to prevent
their cracking. It is classified as Limited
Standard.
s INCH HOWITZER, MK . VIII-%-This
howitzer is also of the built-up type, but
has an inner and an outer tube over which
the jacket is shrunk . No guide rings are
included, as the jacket supports the
weight of the cannon. Other details are
identical with those of the Mk . VI . This
howitzer is mounted on the Mk . VII carriage,
and is classified as Limited
Standard.
a INCH HOWITZER, M1-This weapon
is of built-up construction . The tube
screws into a breech ring fitted with lugs
for support of the breechblock carrier and
attachment of the recoil mechanism . The
carrier-supported breechblock is of the
two-cycle, interrupted-screw type . It is
equipped with a spring-actuated counterbalance,
a percussion type of firing mechanism
and an obturator mechanism . With
the exception of the spindle, pads and
other parts of the obturator, the breech
mechanisms of the 8" Howitzer, M1, and
the 155 mm Gun, M1, are interchangeable.
This howitzer is classified as
Standard (O.C.M. 15938).
8 INCH HOWITZER PLATFORM, M1917
-When in firing position, the Mk . VII
and Mlk. VIII-Y2 howitzers rest on a demountable
firing platform buried flush
with the surface of the gound . For transport,
the platform is loaded on a twowheeled
cart attached to the howitzer
carriage. The cart and platform are each
classified as Limited Standard .
CARRIAGES, MK. VI AND MK. VII
(British)-These carriages differ mainly
in the weight and clearance of the trails,
those of the Mk. VII being raised and
strengthened to accommodate the Mk .
VIII-Y2 howitzer . The cradle rests in the
trunnion bearings of a top carriage which
is pivoted in the front transom of the
trail to permit traverse . A hydropneumatic,
long-recoil type recoil mechanism
carried by the cradle contains both the
recoil brake and the recuperator. The
trail is of the box type cut away to allow
clearance for recoil of the howitzer when
it is fired at high angles of elevation . Allsteel
wheels, 66' in diameter, with tires
12" wide, are fitted with brakes acting
independently on each wheel . These carriages
are classified as Limited Standard .
CARRIAGE, M1-This carriage is identical
in design and construction with the
155 mm Gun Carriage, Ml . Since the howitzer
is considerably heavier than the gun,
it is necessary to increase the nitrogen
pressure in the howitzer recoil mechanism,
M4. The howitzer remains in the battery
position during transport. This carriage is
classified as Standard (O.C.M. 15938).

37 MM GUN M6-STANDARD FOR TANKS
The 37 mm tank guns were developed
from the 37 mm Antitank Gun, M3,
the first model being the 37 mm Tank
Gun, M5. Addition of an automatically
opened breechblock changed the designation
to the M6, standardized by
O.C.M. 16279 dated 14 Nov. 1940 . The
\15 barrel is shorter by about 5 inches
than the barrels of the other guns .
The 37 mm Gun, M6, is standard for
use on Light Tanks, M3A1, M3A3, M5
and \;15A1 on Medium Tank, M3, and
its variations, and on the 37 mm Light
Armored Car, M8. The gun is carried on
the M23, M24 or M44 Mount.
The barrel is a one-piece forging or
casting with a rifled bore, threaded to
screw into the breech ring . Two bearings
support the barrel and align it in the yoke
of the sleigh. Keys are employed to prevent
rotation of the barrel.
The breech ring is broached to receive
the drop-type breechblock . A breechoperating
mechanism is bolted to the
recoil cylinder. Recoil of the gun automatically
opens the breechblock, extracts
the empty cartridge case, locks the breech
in an open position and cocks the gun .
Rounds are inserted into the breech
manually.
The recoil cylinder is assembled with
the trunnion pins mounted in the trunnions
of the yoke . It is provided with rails to
guide the sleigh and contains a recoil
mechanism of the hydrospring type, the
counter-recoil spring, and a buffer mechanism.
In tanks with power traverse the gun
is fired by a solenoid-firing device connected
with the trigger . In other cases
the hand-operated trigger actuator causes
the firing process to start .
The gun may be elevated by a handwheel,
but a throw-out lever permits free
movement of the weapon .
Traverse of guns mounted in tanks with
power-traversing mechanisms is obtained
by power-drive rotation of the turret . In
tanks equipped with manually operated
turrets only, the gun can be traversed
10' right or left by means of a traversing
knob. When greater traverse is necessary
the turret must be rotated or the tank
turned in direction .
A shield is attached to the yoke and
recoil cylinder by bolts, or, in some tanks,
direct to the turret.

75 MM HOWITZER M3-MOUNT W-STANDARD
The decision to adapt the Pack Howitzer,
M1 or M1A1, for use in the Howitzer
Motor Carriage, M8, necessitated spot
welding and keying a tube mounting
support in place over the howitzer tube .
This mounting support increased the
outside diameter of the tube to fit the
central bore of the cradle. Pack howitzer
tubes modified in this manner were
designated Howitzers, M2 . They are now
classified as Substitute Standard .
Since there were insufficient M2 tubes
to supply the required number of howitzer
motor carriages, new tubes were made
with the howitzer mounting support
integral with the tube . These tubes were
given the designation of 75 mm Howitzer,
M3, and classified as Standard .
Howitzers, M2 and M3, are manually
loaded weapons fired electrically by
means of a solenoid, or manually by a
hand firing mechanism handle . The tube
assembly differs from that of the M1 or
M1A1 Howitzers only in the hoop at the
rear end of the mounting support on the
M2 and in the flash detector which is
integral with the howitzer shield in both
the M2 and M3 models.
The tube is screwed into a breech
ring containing a breechblock of the
horizontal sliding wedge type . A recoil
tube retainer, which provides the means
of attaching the two recoil cylinder
assemblies to the tube assembly, is
bolted to a breech yoke support on the
tube.
The tube assembly is supported and
alined in a cradle which is a part of the
mount assembly. The tube mounting
support, which is finish-ground, rides in
liners inside the cradle .
The Firing Lock, M13, fits into an
axial hole in the breechblock . It is of
the continuous-pull, self-cocking type,
and is retained in position by sector lugs
on its exterior which engage with lugs in
the breechblock .
The hydrospring recoil mechanism
consists of two recoil cylinders, one on
each side of the howitzer, which arc held
and located in the cradle . A counter-
75 mm HOWITZER, M3
recoil buffer is attached to the front
cover of each cylinder.
Howitzers, M2 and M3, are mounted in
75 mm Howitzer Mount, M7, which rests
on trunnions in the turret of the Howitzer
Motor Carriage, M8. The mount assembly
is composed of a cradle with two
recoil cylinders, a firing mechanism, and
a recoil guard . The shield is attached to
the forward end of the cradle and is
elevated and depressed with it. Rotation
of the howitzer is prevented by a key in
the cradle which rides in a groove in the
howitzer tube mounting support .
The firing mechanism is mounted on
the rear end of the recoil guard . An electrical
system is provided for primary use,
with current supplied by the vehicle
battery. The system operates electrically
from a firing button, activating the electromagnetic
solenoid, and then through a
mechanical series of linkages to a trigger
chain hooked directly to the trigger . A
hand firing system, which may be employed
in case of failure of the elevation
system, is operated by the hand firing
mechanism handle and utilizes the mechanical
linkage of the electrical firing
system .
A recoil guard of tubular framework
with right and left shields surrounds the
breech. It is attached to the cradle and
acts as a support for the electrical firing
mechanism.
Elevation is accomplished by means of
an elevating mechanism mounted on the
right rear wall of the turret . A train of
gears inside the elevating mechanism
case connects with a pinion that meshes
with the elevating quadrant rack on the
howitzer cradle . The elevating mechanism
is operated by a handwheel which
may be engaged with or disengaged from
the gear train by means of a shifter lever
and a sliding gear .
Traverse is obtained by rotating the
turret . A liandwheel operates a gear train
and a pinion meshed with the traversing
rack bolted to the under side of the turret
roof. A traversing lock is provided to
lock the turret in traveling position .

75 MM GUN M3 STANDARD FOR TANKS
75 mm GUN, M3, SHOWING TUBE, BREECH RING, COCKING LEVER, CLOSING SPRING CYLINDER AND OPERATING HANDLE
The 75 mm - Gun, M3, a development
from the Tank Gun, M2, was standardized
by O.C.M. 17018, dated 24 July
1941 . The M2 gun is now designated as
Limited Standard .
The i113 gun is a single-shot, flat-trajectory
weapon differing from the M2
only in having the tube lengthened by
26.6', with a higher muzzle velocity and
greater range as a result. It is equipped
with a drop-type breechblock automatically
opened . This weapon is mounted in
Medium Tanks, M4, M4A1, M4A2,
M4A3, M4A4, and in Medium Tank, M7,
using Mounts, M34, M34A1 and M47 .
The alloy steel tube screws into the
breech ring, where it is locked into position
with a key . The breech ring contains
the vertical sliding breechblock assembly
and the principal operating parts of the
gun. The breech mechanism is composed
of the breechblock assembly, firing mechanism,
extractors, spline shaft, breechblock

The breech may be opened by means of
an operating handle secured to the spline
shaft.
Manual loading of each round automatically
closes the block. The gun can
be fired either manually or by means of
a solenoid. During counterrecoil after
firing, the gun is cocked, the block is
opened, the cartridge case is extracted
and the breechblock is locked in an open
position for insertion of the next round .
The gun recoils in the mount, which
consists of a horizontal rotor upon which
is mounted the elevating mechanism and
traversing mechanism; the hydraulic recoil
mechanism, supported by trunnions
which rotate in the trunnion seats of the
horizontal rotor ; an elevating shield,
bolted to the trunnions of the recoil
mechanism and projecting through an
opening in the rotor ; two recoil cylinders,
held by the cradle and trunnion assembly
upon which are mounted the solenoid, firing
lever link, and firing lever of the firing
mechanism; and a shoulder guard, bolted
to the cradle, covering the firing mechanism
and extending beyond the rear face
of the breech.

The 76 mm Gun, M1A2, is a modification
of the MI Gun of the same
caliber . The original 76 mm Gun, M1,
was designed to provide tank weapons of
greater power and armor penetration than
were possible with 75 mm armament.
76 mm GUN, M1-This gun was designed
to use the 3" H .E. Shell or A .P.C.
Projectile with a different cartridge case .
The gun tube and extractors were constructed
to accommodate the redesigned
cartridge, but the breech ring and breech
mechanism were similar to those used on
the 75 mm Gun, M3 . This 76 mm Gun,
M1, is now Limited Standard .
76 mm GUN, MIAI-In order to better
adapt the MI Gun to use with various
tanks and gun motor carriages, the contour
of the tube was changed, and the
recoil slide surface on the tube was
The 3" Gun, M7, was designed for use
in Heavy Tanks, M6 and M6A1 . It
was also adopted as standard armament
for the 3' Gun Motor Carriage, M10 .
Ammunition for this weapon is the same
as that for the 3" antitank and antiaircraft
guns .
O.C.M. 16200, dated 24 October 1940,
initiated the development of a 3' gun
similar to 3" Gun, T9, for the Heavy
Tank, T1 . It was designated 3" Gun, T12,
with interior dimensions and ballistics
practically identical with those of the 3"
Antiaircraft Gun, M3, and the 3" Antitank
Gun, 1%15 . After firing tests, the T12
was standardized as 3' Gun, M7, by
O.C .M. 18467, dated 9 July 1942 .
The 3" Gun, M7, is a high-velocity,
manually loaded weapon employing a
semi-automatic breech mechanism with a
lengthened 12 inches, thus permitting
the trunnion position to be set farther
forward to obtain better balance . The
M1 gun with these modifications was
designated 76 mm Gun, M1A1, and is
classified as Limited Standard .
76 mm GUN, MIA2-In the 76 mm
Gun, M1A2, the rifling twist is one turn
in 32 calibers instead of one turn in 40
calibers as in the M1 and M1A1 Guns .
All tubes are threaded at the muzzle to
allow assembly of a muzzle brake, and a
ring is provided to cover the threaded
portion of the tube when the muzzle
brake is not in place. This gun is classified
as Standard.

LAUNCHER, ROCKET, ANTITANK, 2.36 INCH, Y--STANDARD f
The rocket launcher, popularly known
and widely publicized as the "Bazooka,"
represents the adaptation to
modern warfare of one of the oldest forms
of military pyrotechnics, the rocket . It
represents, too, the first practical development
of a rocket gun or rocket launcher
as a shoulder weapon for infantry use
against tanks and other armored targets .
The launcher is an open tube approximately
54 inches long and 2 .365 inches
in internal diameter equipped with a
shoulder stock, a pistol grip, electrical
firing mechanism, and sights . The Rocket,
M6A3, is 19.4 inches long and weighs
3.38 pounds. It carries a shaped charge
of TNT capable of penetrating heavy
armor at angles of impact up to 30°. The
optimum range is approximately 200
yards although the rocket may be em-
424 11I6AlIIIRIp
ROCKET LAUNCHER, M9,-BROKEN DOWN
ROCKET LAUNCHER, A.T., M9, LEFT SIDE
ployed at ranges as great as 600 yards .
The Rocket, 2 .36 inch, M6A3, is illustrated
and described in the ammunition
section of this catalogue.
In its original form the rocket launcher
was supplied with a wooden shoulder
stock midway of its length and was not
reinforced for additional bore-safety .
A two-cell dry battery supplied the spark
for ignition of the rocket's propelling
charge, pressure on the trigger completing
the circuit.
The first models of the launcher were
equipped with a hinged rear sight and
fixed front sights . These were followed
by a peep rear sight and a front sight in
the form of a rectangular frame at the
muzzle of the launcher. The vertical
sides of the frame carried graduations
for ranges of 100, 200, and 300 yards .
The rocket launcher was introduced
as a combat weapon during the North
African campaign of 1942-43 . Use in
battle indicated the need for various
improvements and for a model which
could be broken down into two approximately
equal loads for use by parachute
troops . The present launcher, M9, represents
the development of those tactical
requirements .
Since a higher safety factor was required,
the tube of the launcher is now
wrapped with wire around all that portion
adjacent to the operator's face. The
skeleton stock is of metal and is shaped
so as to permit two shoulder positions
for ease of sighting at high and low
elevations and for prone shooting . Midway
of the tube is a flange with bayonet
joints which breaks the launcher into
sections which may be carried by paratroopers
or packed into containers for
aerial delivery . Reassembly can be
effected in a few seconds without tools
and the joint locked rigidly.
The dry cells which supplied the ignition
spark in the earlier models have been
replaced -by a self-contained magneto
operated by pressure on the "squeezer"
type trigger. A one-way safety switch
incorporated in the trigger mechanism
cuts out the magneto and prevents generation
of an electrical impulse as the
trigger returns to position .
The sight is an optical ring hinged to
fold against the tube when not in use
and protected by a cover. An adjustable
range scale provides graduations from
50 to 700 yards in 50-yard increments .
Assembled and ready for firing, the
rocket launcher measures 55 inches overall
and weighs approximately 14%
pounds.

LIGHT TANKS
Light tanks are those which weigh 20 tons or less . By this
definition even the Japanese so-called medium tanks and the German
Pzlcw III medium taxik fall into this class .
AU early light tanks were armed with 3
guns . The Germans
ave mounted a 50mm and a short-barreled 75 -.eapon in their latest
light tanks, whereas the now U. S. Light Tank, 24, mounts a 75mm
cannon. The Japanese have used a short-barreled 57ma gun in their
Model 97 tank and a 47mm tank gun with a higher velocity in their
latest model (2597 Special) .
Light t :axs arc primarily reconnaissance vehicles, am aceordingly
their armor is not designed to "slugging it out" with enemy
tanks or a:nti--,r guns .
U . s . Light tanks have always been praised for their reliability
and mobility . The early M3 and M5 models were criticized for their
lack of firepower, although at close ranges . this weapon is capable
of knocking out the heavyy tank of the Germz .ns . The U. S. 37mm gun
was at least as pov~erfll as tie Germ and Jupcne" counterparts in
the field tit hat time .
The + incorporates all the battle experience gained earlier
in the .x~ r, including such features as gyro stabilizers and Hydramatic
tri,nsri ssion. It yes ALU advantage of sloping armor coeensurate
with the weight limitations svecified by the using services .
It has seen considerable service in Europe, and reports on its battlefield
performance contain nothing but praise .
MEDIUM TANKS
Pz. Kpfw. III Aus. A. B, C. D, E (Sd. Kfz . 141)
Reports on the early development of the Pz . Kw. III do not
agree. The following summary conforms to the best information
available.
Model A-Weighed about 20 tons. Its suspension arrangemerit
consisted of eight small bogie wheels each side on semielliptical,
laminated springs, with three return rollers . Motivating
power was generated by a Maybach V-12 gasoline engine rated
300 hp . Armament consisted of a 3 .7 cm Kw. K ., two light machine
guns in the turret, and one light machine gun in the front plate of
the superstructure . Armor consisted of 30 mm plate all around .
Model B-Same as Model A except for suspension which consisted
of five medium size bogie wheels and two return rollers .
Model C-Principal change was the new type suspension
which incorporated six bogie wheels and three return rollers,
which became standard for the Pz. Kw. III tank . It is believed that
torsion bar suspension evolved in this model.
Model D'-At this point in the development the previous
models were given the nomenclature D' . Commander's tanks are
known to have been produced serially from this period on .
Model E-Represents the first model in which the definite Pz .
Kw. III type has been crystallized . It embodies the improvements
made in previous models. It carried the same armament (3 .7 cm
Kw. K.) and had a suspension arrangement of six bogie wheels
sprung on torsion bars and three return rollers.
A self-propelled equipment known as the Sturmgeschutz has
been developed from the Pz. Kw. III . It consists of the Pz . Kw. III
chassis mounting a short-barreled 7 .5 cm Kw. K. The chassis was
later used to mount the 7.5 cm Kw . K. 40, long-barreled gun, and
the 10 .5 cm howitzer.

Pz. Kpfw. III Aus . F, G, H (Sd . Kfz. 141)
Model F-This is the first tank of the series to mount a 5 .0 cm
Kw. K. electrically fired tank gun in place of the 3.7 cm Kw. K. and
also the first to have a new type mantlet. This mantlet has a thick
shield on the front which moves with the gun. A single machine
gun is mounted coaxially on the right of the 5 .0 cm gun and the
hull machine gun is retained.
The hull consists of three separate subassemblies : (1) lower
hull, (2) front superstructure carrying turret, and (3) rear superstructure
covering the engine compartment. All units are of single
skin welded construction.
The turret forms the roof of a spacious fighting compartment,
being mounted over the middle part of the hull. It has no rotating
platform, the commander and the gunner having seats suspended
from and rotating with the turret . The loader apparently stands on
the floor of the fighting compartment . The commander's cupola is
boltea to the roof of the turret on the center-line to the rear .
The suspension is the same as that used in Model E .
The engine is the Maybach V-12, gasoline, rated 320 hp. Its
transmission is the synchromesh type with 10 speeds forward and
4 reverse. Its steering is of the epicyclic, clutch brake type with
hydraulic control.
Model G-Identical in armament, mantlet, and mechanical
components to Model F, the only difference being in the cupola,
which is more squat and has all-around vision .
Model H-This model has additional 32 mm plates bolted on
the front of the superstructure, on the upper and lower nose plates
and on the tail plate. The outstandinq recognition features of this
model are its front sprocket which has six spokes, and its rear
idler which is more open than the earlier type, though it has eight
spokes. Wider tracks and narrower bogie wheels are also used .

Pz. Kpfw. III Aus .J, K (Sd. Kfz. 141)
Model J-The principal differences between Model J and
earlier models are
1. Increased thickness of basic armor plate on certain front
and rear plates from 30 mm to 50 mm and the addition of spaced
armor on the front of the gun mantlet and the front plate of the
superstructure .
2. Hydraulically operated steering in the earlier models has
been replaced by mechanical steering. As previously reported,
the complicated Maybach Variorex ten-speed gear was abandoned
in Model H in favor of a manual six-speed and reverse gear box.
3 . Wider tracks-15 inches instead of 14'/a inches . The
heavier track necessitated a change in the spacing of the return
rollers. Front and rear rollers are now mounted directly over the
Luvax shock absorbers and prevent the track fouling the latter .
4. The tail plate has been modified to give better protection
to the rear air outlet : it also allows the smoke device to be mounted
inside the plate.
5. One or two mild steel bars, welded at each end, are fixed
across the middle of the nose plate . The track shoes are placed
behind the bars and are held in position by the bridge of the shoe .
6. The mounting of the 5.0 cm Kw. K. 39 (long gun) was incorporated
in the latest of the Model J tanks .
The most prominent recognition points of this model are : the
mounting of the hull machine gun is of prominent ball type ; the
driver's visor consists of a single hinged piece of armor instead of
two separate plates ; the front sprocket and rear idler are similar to
those in Model H; particularly squat turret, pear-shaped with
circular cupola well set to the rear .
Model K-Same as Model J. This model mounted the 5 .0 cm
long gun (Kw. K. 39).

Model L-In this model the loader's visor in the right of the
gun mantlet has been omitted as well as the vision opeiiings on
each side of the turret in front of the access doors . Spaced armor
is always fitted on the front of the superstructure and fittings for
spaced armor are provided on the gun mantlet, but the curved
spaced plate is not always fitted in the latter position . The long
5.0 cm Kw.K. 39 is balanced by a torsion bar . The torsion bar
compensator is mounted on the roof of the turret and connected to
the gun by means of a link . On the cupola of this model a metal
framework is attached, probably to serve as a rest for the gun . In
other respects Model L is identical to Model I . German markings
on this tank indicate that it was prepared for tropical or desert use .
Preparation consisted of slight changes in the air-cooling system
and addition of deflectors on the rear of the tank to prevent the
exhaust gases and cooling air from striking the ground .
Model M-This model is similar to Model L with the exception
that it has no loading doors fitted on the side of the hull.
Models N, O-Reports indicate the existence of these models
but no details are available .
A few Model L tanks and many Model M and N tanks now
mount the 7.5 cm Kw.K., which is the short gun formerly fitted in
the Pz . Kpfw. IV. Recent models of the Pz. Kpfw. III now in service
mount, therefore, either the 5 cm long gun or the 7.5 cm short gun .
When the latter gun is mounted, the spaced armor plate on the gun
mantlet and the fittings for it are omitted altogether . The mantlet
is one of the Pz. Kpfw. III type without loader's visor, but the recoil
gear casing and armored protecting sleeve in front of the mantlet
are of the type provided on the Pz . Kpfw. IV. In a captured Model

MEDIUM TANKS
Medium tanks are those in the 22- to 40-ton weight class .
Although the Japanese have so-called medium tanks, they are lighter
than the American medium tanks and in the interest of fair comparison
have been compared with American light tanks . The German PzKw V and
VI are considered as heavy tanks .
The using services of our Army have built the Armored Force
around the Medium Tank, M4 . As in German tanks, the main armament
has, advanced from a relatively low-velocity 75x gun to a high-velocity
76 ma gun which has been standard in U . F- . medium tanks for over a year .
The 114 Shermen is famed for its tough armor, considering its weight
limitation of 3a• tons . It is considerably superior to the German
PzKw IV.
As many top commanders such as Patton and hovers have testified,
the greatly superior mechanical reliability and maneuverability under
most conditions, the power traverse, and the use of a gyrostabilizer,
have not only made the U. S . M4 tank superior to -the German PzCw IV
but also enabled our 30-ton medium tanks to outfight the heavy German
tanks .
To provide an assault tank with heavy frontal armor for use in
ETO, a number of M4A3E2 tanks with a frontal armor basis of 6 1/2 -
10" have been produced. Reports indicate they have been highly
successful for the purpose intended .
The Japanese have tanks in this weight class, but they have
never been encountered in action and no reliable technical data
are available .
MEDIUM TANKS
Pz. Kpfw. IV Aus. A. B, C, D, E (Sd. Kfz. 161)
Weighing up to 24 tons in battle array, it is the standard German
medium tank. Ten models, A, B, C, D, E, F, F2 , G,'--H, K, are
known to have been produced. All models utilize the same suspension
arrangement of eight evenly spaced bogie wheels, 181/2
inches in diameter, sprung in pairs on each side, with four return
rollers. All models mount the 7.5 cm Kw. K. except Models F 2 and
G, which mount the 7.5 cm Kw. K . 40 . The chassis of this tank is
used as a self-propelled mount for heavier guns, such as the
"Hornet," the "Bee, ' and the "Grizzly Bear."
Model A-An early experimental type. It weighed 20 tons,
unladen, and had a 5-speed transmission (S .F.G. 75) and an H .L .
108 T.R. Maybach engine.
Model B-The first model to bear the standard Pz . Kw. IV type
number Sd . Kfz . 161. This model had a new type of 6-speed transmission
(S .S.G. 76) and an improved H .L. 120 T.R.M. Maybach
engine
Model C-Distinguishable from Model B by its "wish-bone"
aerial deflector. It was the first model to have an armored sleeve
protecting the turret machine gun, and the front plate of its superstructure
extends straight across the tank in one piece .
Model D-The fixed outer gun mantlet is dispensed with and
the moving portion is fitted with a thick front shield, the edges of
which overlap and protect the mantlet joints . The driver's compartment
extends farther forward than the machine gunner's
compartment. The basic armor in this model is 30 mm in thickness
in front and 20 mm on the sides . Its unladen weight is 20 1/2 tons.
Model E-Distinguishable from the Model D by its new type
of front driving sprocket, and by the new design of shutter (single
hinge) on the driver's visor. The nose plate armor is increased
from 30 mm to 50 mm. Weight is 21.5 tons, unladen.

Pz. Kpfw. IV Aus. F1 . F2, G. H, K (Sd. Kfz. 161)
Model F-The hull, superstructure, and turret, as in all other
known models of the Pz. Kpfw. N, is of welded construction . The
basic frontal armor, including superstructure and turret of Model F,
was increased to 50 mm ; on the sides to 30 mm. The main hull
superstructure projects over the top of the tracks, providing additional
stowage space and a wide base upon which to mount the
turret. The turret floor is carried by brackets from the turret ring
and consequently rotates with the turret .
The suspension consists of 4 bogie assemblies, each fitted with
two rubber-tired bogie wheels 18V2 inches in diameter on each
side, with a quarter elliptic spring anchored beneath the leading
axle arm of each assembly . There is a front sprocket, the spokes of
which are bent outward from the hub cap giving the outside a
dished appearance, a rear idler which has 7 spokes instead of 8
as in previous models, and 4 return rollers .
The power plant consists of a Maybach HL 120 TRM, V-12
O.H.V., 4-stroke, gasoline engine, rated 320 B .H.P . at 3,000 r.p.m.
The armament consists of a 7 .5 cm Kw. K., 24 cals . in length, a
coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 mounted in the turret, and a 7 .92 mm
MG 34 at the right of the front plate of the superstructure .

HEAVY TANK "Tiger"
Pz. Kpfw. "Tiger" (8 .8 cm Kw. K. 36 L/56) (Sd. Kfz. 181)
The Pz. Kpfw . VI was introduced into service by Germany in
the latter part of 1942 .
Its construction incorporates a notable departure from past
German practice in that the superstructure is welded to the main
hull instead of being bolted . The use of heavy armor called for
flat plates wherever possible, resulting in a simple box-like contour.
Another interesting development in construction' involves
plate interlocking, secured by welding, in addition to the normal
step jointing . This has no doubt been made necessary by the use
of thicker armor, which ranges from 102 mm in the front nose
plate to 92 mm in the cast steel gun mantlet . and 80 mm in the
side superstructure .
The hull is divided into four compartments. The floor of the
fighting compartment is suspended from and rotates with the
turret. The turret is centrally mounted between the hull side
plates. A circular fixed cupola, with an inside diameter of 20
inches, is mounted in the turret roof.
The suspension consists of front sprocket, rear idler, and eight
triple, rubber-tired bogie wheels 31 1/2 inches in diameter sprung
on torsion bars . The wheel assemblies straddle each other in such
a manner that the outer rims of four of the wheels on each side
may be removed to accommodate the narrow (20 1/2 inch) transportation
track. For combat a wider (28'/2 inch) track is utilized .
The mechanical layout follows orthodox German practice .
The Maybach, V-12, 642 hp. engine is mounted centrally at the
rear.
The armament consists of an electrically fired 8.8 cm Kw.K. 36
with coaxial 7 .92 mm MG 34 in the turret, a ball-mounted MG 34
in the vertical plate, a 9 mm machine gun stowed, six smoke
generators, and three mine throwers mounted on the superstructure
roof. The existence of a Model "P" has also been reported .

SELF-PROPELLED HOWITZERS - LIGHT
Early in this war the value of mounting guns larger than 75mm
on a tank chassis was appreciated, and the 105am Howitzer on the medium
tank chassis was . developed and produced in time to take part in the
battles of Africa . The first model was designated the 105mm Howitzer
Motor Carriage, M7, and nicknamed the "Priest" . The M37, an approved
version, is now standard .
Although, designed primarily for use as artillery, this weapon
can be used effectively against tanks with its HEAT (shaped-charge)
ammmmition . The 105mm howitzer is not turret mounted and has only a
limited traverse. The vehicle also mounts a cal . .50 machine gun in a ring
mount for antiaircraft protection and for use against light ground targets .
The success of the 105mm howitzer in this chassis has led to the installation
of a number of 105mm howitzer in later models of the 94 tank (see
Medium Tanks) .
The Germans have mounted 105mm howitzers on both their ? w II
aack-Sz.Ew III chassis . There is also scant information concerning a
105mabrowitzer mounted on the modified chassis of the PzKw IV Medium Tank .
Up to the present time the Japanese have not used any weapons
similar to these against our forces .
The German and U . S . 105mm howitzers are about equal. . The U .S.
self-propelled mounts have the advantage of superior reliability of the
tank components on which they are based .
BATTLE FIELD REPORTS ON THE
105WA HOWITZER MOTOR CARRIAGE, M7
"We have been in combat 63 days with the M7's and during that
time we have had very few weapons out on account of motor trouble .
Their extreme mobility has been very useful in the terrain and
especially during the Cherbourg campaign and the break through . I
like them and the men like them ." (Intell Bulletin #18 from General
Blakely on the Combat Record of the M7, organic in the 4th . Div.
Artillery .)
"The self-propelled howitzer proved to be a very effective
weapon for close direct fire, and it is believed to be the proper
weapon for the infantry cannon company in this type of operation ."
(Exp. of 7th . Div. in Capture of Southern Part of Kwajelain Atoll)
"All officers who had observed our 105mm self-propelled gun
were very enthusiastic about it ." (Ref: OKD 385/177.1 No . 7 Report
of Col. Reynolds and Col. Botch, AGF)
S .P . ASSAULT GUN
Sturmgeschutz 7.5 cm K. (Sd . Kfz. 142)
The Sturmgeschutz is an assault weapon. Unlike the two
other classes of self-propelled guns, antitank and artillery, which
consist merely of guns placed in the hull of a tank with shields
erected around the front and sides thereof, the assault gun is built
into the hull and is consequently nearer the ground and has a
much more solid superstructure built round the gun. The original
Sturmgeschutz consisted of the turretless chassis of a Pz. Kpfw. III
tank, upon which was mounted the Stu . G. 7.5 cm K., a short-barreled
(69 .5 inch) piece found in the first models of the Pz. Kpfw .
IV. Since the power plant and other mechanical components of the
chassis of the Sturmgeschutz are identical to those of the Pz . Kpfw.
III tank, and their weights are approximately the same, the
performance data of the two are comparable .
The turret of the original tank has been removed and replaced
by a squat superstructure, reducing the height of the vehicle from
8 feet, 3 inches as a tank to 6 feet, 5 inches as an assault weapon,.
The gun compartment is roofed over, but there is no rotating turret .
The fighting compartment is armored as follows : front 53 mm,
sides 43 mm, top 11 mm .
The gun, which is mounted low in the hull and fires forward,
is identical to the 7.5 cm Kpfw. K. short tank gun, originally the
main armament of the Pz. Kpfw. IV tank . It is primarily a close
support weapon, the ammunition scale comprising only 25% A.P .
against 10% smoke and 65% H.E . ; its armor-piercing performance
is relatively poor. Its muzzle velocity and maximum range firing
H.E . shell is 1,378 f. s. and 6,758 yards, respectively. The penetration
of A .P.C.B.C. shell against homogeneous armor is reported as
follows : 500 yards, 1 .81 inches at 30° obliquity, 2 .16 inches normal
-1000 yards, 1 .61 inches at 30° . 1.97 inches normal-1,200 yards,
1 .57 inches at 30', 1 .89 inches normal.

SELF-PROPELLRD GUNS AND HOWITZERS, MEDIUM, 150 - 155tmg
The Germans have used in this war a number of improvised selfpropelled
howitzers in the 150mm class . The most frequently encountered
are :
15cm BIG 33 mounted on the Pzkw I and Pzkw II chassis,
15am SFR 18 mounted on the Pzkw IV chassis,
16cm STUII 43, also mounted on the Pskw IV chassis .
The Japanese have one self-propelled 15cm howitzer on a medium
tank chassis . The maximum range of any of these weapons is approximately
15,000 yards .
Early in the war, the Orananoe Department developed the 155mm
Gun Motor Carriage, M12, using the World War type 156m (1PF, which
had a maximum range of 20,100 yards. One hundred of these were
manufactured but there were no immediate requirements. Experience
in France showed the great value of highly mobile self-propelled
artillery of this size, and urgent requirements were then submitted
for the improved type recently standardized as the 155m Gun Motor
Carriage, M40 (T83) . The M40 mounts the 156m Gun, Ml, which has a
maximum range of 26 .715-yards . The older 3112 fired the first shot
into Germany and the new M40 fired the first shot into Cologne .
Also recently standardized is the 155m Howitzer Motor Carriage,
U41, (T64E1) .
Tiese U. S. weapons, which are mounted on medium tank chassis,
demonstrate how successfully large weapons can be mounted on mobile
ohassis to meet the specific needs of the using services.
S .P. HEAVY INFANTRY HOWITZER
Gw. II fur 15 cm s. I. G. 33
This vehicle consists of the 15 cm . heavy infantry howitzer
mounted in the hull of a modified, turretless Pz. Kpfw. II chassis.
The chassis is approximately three feet longer than -that of the
standard Pz Kw II tank and has six bogie wheels instead of the
usual five . The sprockets, rear idlers, bogie wheels, return rollers,
steering assembly, gear box and hull nose are those of the Pz .
Kpfw. II; the instrument panel is that of a Pz. Kpfw. III. The front
shield is in one piece extending straight across the full width of
the superstructure. The driver's visor is of the double shutter type.
The road performance of this equipment approximates that of the
Pz. Kpfw. II tank.
The gun, a standard infantry support weapon, is mounted low
in the hull, projecting through a vertical slot in the shield. The
gun shield is 15 mm thick and is of shallow construction . It
extends about a third of the distance of the superstructure to the
rear. Unlike the "Wasp" there are no protecting side plates along
the entire length of the superstructure .
The gun is 64.57 inches in length, has a muzzle velocity of
790 f.s. and a maximum effective range of 5140 yards . The casting
containing the recuperator and buffer, housed underneath the
barrel, extends almost to the end of the barrel . The breech
mechanism is similar to the 10.5 cm. I.F.H. 18. The elevating qear
is operated from the right and the traversing gear from the left .
In field mounting its traverse is 11°, its elevation 0° to + 73° .
Two types of ammunition are fired, the 15 cm. I. Gr . 33 and the
115 cm. L Gr. 38. The H.E . capacity is high . 21.8%. The only other
ishell that the weapon is known to fire is a smoke shell, the 15 cm .
ii. Gr. 38 Nb. The same percussion fuze, s .I. Gr. Z. 23, which weighs
i75 lbs ., is used in each case .

S .P. HEAVY FIELD HOWITZER-"Bumblebee"
Gw. III /IV (Hummel) fur 15 cm s.F.H. 18/1 (Sd. Kfz. 165)
This equipment, known as the "Bumble Bee," is composed of
the 15 cm heavy field howitzer mounted on a modified Pz. Kw. IV
tank chassis. It should not be confused with the 10.5 cm l .F.H.
18/2 ("Wasp"), which is the 10 .5 cm light field howitzer mounted
on the chassis of a Pz. Kw. II tank. The road performance of the
"Bee" will approximate that of the Pz. Kw. IV tank.
In the construction of this vehicle the following modifications
were made to the hull of the .Pz. Kw. N tank. The turret top plate
mounting the turret traversing ring, the front vertical plate, and
the rear partition separating the engine from the fighting compartment
have been removed . The engine, cooling-fan assembly
and exhaust pipes have been moved forward up to the gear box.
A partition has been built across the width of the hull dividing the
driver and assistant driver from the fighting compartment . A
steel plate separates the engine from the fighting compartment .
In place of the driver's entrance hatches a cover similar to a
cupola, with lid and shutter type vision, is provided.
The superstructure is in the form of a sloping four-sided shield
10 mm (.39 inch) thick. The front of the shield provides a bulging
slot for the traverse and elevation of the gun while the rear plate
is fitted with a hinged door .
The gun is mounted well back on the top of the engine cover
plate by means of angle iron and steel brackets so that its muzzle
projects almost flush with the nose of the hull . It retains its original
buffer, recuperator and compensator, and elevating and traversing
gears. Its overall length including muzzle brake, with which it
must be fitted when firing charge 8, is 17 feet, 4 1/4 inches. The
muzzle velocities of this piece are : Charge 6, 1,020 f. S. ; Charge 7,
1,375 f . s.; Charge 8, 1,965 f. s. The maximum ranges are : Charge
6, 10,550 yards; Charge 7, 12,140 yards; Charge 8, 14,380 yards.
Its elevation is 0°-39° ; traverse each side 16° .

HALF-TRACK PERSONNEL CARRIERS
Depsite the fact that the Germans have many models of half-track
(more properly three-quarter track) vehicles and have made wide use
of them, the latest battlefield reports contain high praise for the
American half-track as an all-around vehicle . This is no doubt due
to the great reliability engineered into this vehicle . Earlier in
the war our half-track was used as a self-propelled mount for Cal .
.50, 37mm, 75mm, and 105mm weapons, but this use has now been taken
over by fulltrack vehicles for all expect the Multiple Cal . .50
Gun Motor Carriage .
The German-half-track personnel carriers range in weight from
5 to 7.7 tons when armored and from 3 .7 tons through 16 .8 tons when
unarmored. These vehicles are also used as self-propelled mounts and
also as prime movers .
The German half-tracks are well engineered, making maxim:= use
of interchangeability of components among sizes and with other types
of combat vehicles . The longer track gives them better flotation on
soft ground but the American running gear is less complicated and
better adapted for long-range operations . Because of the many
varieties of German three-quarter tracks, only a selected number are
illustrated .
The Japanese have only recently used any kind of half-track,
and no technical data are yet available .
BATTIE FIELD REPORTS ON HALF TRACK PERSONNEL CARRIERS
"The American half-track manufactured by Aut-Car, Diamond T, White,
and International Harvester Companies, are no doubt the best vehicles of
their type in the world, but if several of the features found in the
simiiLr German vehicle were incorporated in our half-tracks they would
be even better than they are .
"The advantage of the Q.S. tracks in maintenance is much greater in
that the engines, chassis, tracks, and suspensions are interchangeable .
This is not possible with the many models of the Gennans . The U .S.
track has more speed and power, making it a better road vehicle, and
more maneuverable in cross-country use ." (Comment of Lt . Col. R.N. dens,
Commanding 41st Armored Inf ., Regt .)
MEDIUM ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER
m. gp. Mannsch. Kw. (Sd. Kfz. 251)
GERMAN O
This vehicle is a medium armored personnel carrier with the
chassis of the Sd. Kfz. 11 (light semitracked prime mover) . The
Sd. Kfz. 11 has been modified by placing armor on the chassis,
a,~tering the cooling arrangement, and mounting the steering wheel
in- an inverted position. The armor plate thickness measures
7.5 mmF on the radiator cover, 8 .5 mm on the sides, and 15 mm on
the lower front plate, set at angles to the horizontal of 81° . 55-60°,
and 55° respectively . It has been reported that these vehicles
were used by the motorized infantry of armored divisions . Eight
variations are known to exist with designations 251/1 through
251/8. The vehicles are used for infantry, ammunition and- as
command vehicles with built-in wireless, or ambulances .
The suspension is the same as that utilized for the Sd . Kfz . 11,
as is also the power plant and the power train .
The armament normally consists . of two 7.92 mm M.G. 34's,
one on a mount welded to the front of the chassis and one on, an
antiaircraft pedestal mount in the rear of the vehicle . Reports have
been received that the 2 cm Kw .K. 30 is also mounted. The vehicle
has a seating capacity for eleven men, including the driver .

ARWRED CARS
Armored cars are designed for highway and favorable crosscountry
reconnaissance . They cannot travel on the unfavorable
terrain negotiable by tracked vehicles, but since they are completely
wheeled, their running gear has much longer life. Armored
cars are by design much more lightly armored than tanks .
The German and C. 8. models are fairly similar in appearance .
The U. S . types have six wheels, whereas the Germans use four, six,
and eight .
The U. 3 . troops have been provided with the Armored Car, iB,
throughout this war . The Armored Utility Car, 920, serves as an
accompanying vehicle . The Armored Car, lid, mounts a 37am Gun .
The Germans have a variety of armored cars, most modern of
which weigh 8-1/2 and 11-1/2 tons . The 8-l/2 ton car mounts a
single 20 gun and a heavy machine gun, whereas the 11-1/2-ton
car mounts a 50mm tank Gun KWg 39 with a muzzle vet -ty of 2,700
feet per second . The Germans also have mounted a 75mm low-velocity
gun on the eight-wheeled armored car .
No Japanese armored cars have been encountered in action since
the Solomon Islands campaign . The only models for which technical
data are available are of the obsolete type used to carry money and
securities in this country before the war .
6-WHEELED ARMORED CARS
s. Pz. Sp. Wg. (Sd. Kfz. 231, 232, 263)
This six-wheeled armored car is a heavy, highly mobile vehicle
with a four-man crew . It is armed with one 20 mm KwK 30
and one M. G . 34 coaxially mounted in the turret .
Like the 8 Rad Panzerspahwagen, the six-wheeled vehicle
can be operated from either the front or rear, duplicate controls
.being fitted at either end . Steering is by front wheels only. It
has a six-wheeled final drive ; single wheels at the front, and dual
double wheels at the rear . The front springs are fitted to the
frame with shock absorbers. The rear springs are suspended by
tubular traverse, semi-elliptical springs. It has six forward and
six reverse speeds.
Special gripper chains are available for fitting over the rear
wheels, thus giving each pair the function of a track . Slightly
smaller wheels may be fitted outside the front wheels giving extra
traction on soft ground.
The engine, manufactured by Bussing Nag, is a water-cooled,
100 horsepower, gasoline type. The superstructure is built by
Deutsche Werke, Kiel.
This vehicle carries the same nomenclature as its 8-wheeled
counterpart . Model 231 is the heavily armored variation carrying
both the cannon and the machine gun. No. 232 is a wireless command
vehicle and No. 263 an armored wireless vehicle without
the 20 mm gun .
These cars are used for reconnaissance, police patrol work,
as command vehicles, and as radio receiving and sending stations .

-AAT1TANK GUN
3.7 cm Pak
The 3 .7 cm, formerly the chief German antitank gun, has
been largely replaced by the 5 cm (1 .97 in.) ; antitank gun. A
stick bomb, 6 1/4 inches in diameter and with an overall length of
29 1/8 inches, has been recently introduced for use with the gun.
The bomb, a hollow charge type, has a steel rod which fits into
the bore of the piece, and a perforated sleeve which fits around
the barrel. Its use is likely restricted to short ranges .
The gun is normally towed on its own wheels by a tractor
but may also be carried on a lorry . Weighing 950 lbs ., it is a suitable
weapon for use by air-borne troops.
The piece consists of an "A" tube, jacket and breech ring
combined. The breech block is of the horizontal sliding block
type with a hand operated block stop .
The axle incorporates independent suspension which is, however,
locked when firing, the freeing and locking being controlled
by the opening and closing of the trail legs .
The lower carriage has a pivot housing and bearing face for
the top carriage. It also carries the traversing rack, the travelling
clamp and the locking gear for the trail legs and houses the axle .
The layer stands on the left side of the weapon and operates
the traverse with his right hand by a small handwheel (clockwise
to the right, anticlockwise to the left) . The arc of traverse is 60 ° .
The arc of 21 ° elevation and 13° depression is completed by 32 1/2
turns of the handwheel, which the layer operates with his left hand .
A hydraulic buffer and spring recuperator are provided .
The straight tube telescope sights are mounted on an upright
bracket carried on the top carriage.
The shield is composed of the gun shield and leg shield, of
3/16" armor plate . The leg shield folds under the lower carriage
when travelling, and folds down to ground level when in action .

5 cm Pak 38
The 5 cm Pak 38, introduced during the 1941 campaigns in
Greece and Egypt, was developed to combat the more heavily
armored vehicles of the Allies .
The gun has a barrel of monobloc construction, threaded at
the muzzle for attaching a two-baffled muzzle brake . Because of the
position of the breech-operating cam, a minimum length of recoil
of approximately 18'/2 inches is needed to operate the semi-automatic
breech mechanism which, is of the sliding horizontal block
type. The recoil recuperator system is hydropneumatic.
The carriage, constructed of welded steel, is mounted on metal
disk wheels with solid rubber tires . Torsion springs which support
the gun in travel are automatically locked when the tubular
trails are spread. A 5 mm armor shield and apron protect the gun
crew. The left side of the shield has a sighting port .
There are four types of ammunition fired from the Pak 38 :
an armor-piercing capped, high-explosive, ballistic-capped projectile
; a high-explosive shell and an A.P .-H.E. (uncapped) shell.

The 8.8 cm Pak 43 is an electrically fired, semiautomatic gun,
mounted on a cruciform platform (Kreuzlafette) and transported
on two single axle limbers similar to those used on the 8 .8 cm
Flak 18. It has a very low silhouette, on wheels the height to the
top of the shield is 5 feet, 6 inches, and to the trunnions, 4 feet .
When emplaced it is 12 inches lower .
The gun can be fired from its wheels without extending the
side legs, if the direction of fire does not exceed 30 0 either side
of the longitudinal girders . If the direction of fire is greater than
30°; the side legs must be extended and the pads brought firmly
in contact with the ground . There is an automatic electric cut-out
to the firing gear which restricts elevation to 12° on early equipments
and 16° on later equipments when firing over the mounting
legs.
There are several other versions of the Pak 43 . The Pak 43/41
(page 113) has a two-wheeled carriage with split trails . The Pak
43/1 (page 34) is a self-propelled gun called the "Rhinoceros ."
Its chassis is a combination of a Pz . Kw. III and Pz. Kw. IV. The
Pak 43, 2 (page 39) is a self-propelled gun called the "Elephant" :

which is fitted above the barrel ; the balancing cylinders are
mounted vertically on either side of the carriage.
The sight bracket is marked for 8.8 cm Pak 43/41 and 8 .8 cm
Pak 43 Sfl. This marking tends to confirm the opinion that the
Pak 43 is a modification of, or development from, the 8 .8 cm Flak

MULTI-PURPOSE GUN
8.8 cm Flak 18, 36, 37
This multi-purpose weapon emerged as the most highly
publicized artillery piece of the German army during the North
African campaign. It is primarily an antiaircraft gun adaptable
to antitank and general artillery use . In its antitank role it is fitted
with a shield . In its mobile form it is towed on four wheels,
usually with an 8-ton half-tracked tractor .
The tube assembly of the gun is of a construction not come
parable to any design now in use in this country. It consists of an
outer tube or jacket, an inner locking tube and a loose three-section
liner. The front and center sections of the liner are keyed in place
so as to align the rifling and prevent relative rotation .
The mount is provided with two outriggers for stability when
firing in traverses other than directly front or rear . These are
hinged to the bottom carriage to travel in a vertical position .
During firing the outriggers are let down and secured by half-round
locking pins .
The mount is equipped with three means of fire control depending
on the usage : data transmission for antiaircraft fire, direct
laying for antitank fire and indirect laying for indirect fire .
Specifications listed herewith are based on tests conducted at
Aberdeen Proving Ground of a captured 88 mm model Flak 18,
under Ordnance Program 5772 . The mechanical-type fuse setter
and the azimuth indicators were examined at Frankford Arsenal .
The differences implied by the nomenclatures, Flak 18, 36 and

This new German multi-purpose 8 .8 cm gun is built on massive
proportions. The piece, which has an overall length of approximately
262 inches, has a built-up tube with a securing collar
at the forward end of the jacket .
A breech mechanism of the horizontal sliding type is operated
manually by a handle on top of the breech ring ; it may also be
operated semi-automatically, opening 'action and extraction taking
place during counter-recoil, and closing action following when a
round is rammed home .
The hydropneumatic recuperator cylinder is fitted above the
barrel; and the buffer is in the cradle . A lug riding in a cam below
the left trunnion is geared to rotate the control rod, varying the
length of recoil with the elevation . Spring equilibrators are located
on either side of the upper carriage .
The elevating mechanism is of the single rack and pinion type .
Three elevation speeds are provided and selected by positioning
a lever on top of the gear box to which the handwheels are fitted .
Three traverse speeds are also provided and selected in the same
manner as the elevation speeds .
The cannoneer has the choice of two sitting positions . For
direct fire he sits facing the front and fires the gun by pressing an
electric push-button with his right foot . The left foot rest, when
not depressed, brakes the traverse . When sitting in the antiaircraft
position, the cannoneer faces the side of the gun and matches
pointers . Here again the left foot rest is a brake pedal, braking the
traverse when released . The gun has a total traverse of 360° . The
gun crew is protected by a shield 5/16 inch thick and 7 feet, 3
inches high. Both steel casing and normal casing shells are used.

LIGHT FIELD HOWITZER
10.5 cm 1.`~.A 18 (M)
GERMAN*
In order to obtain longer range, the 105 mm German Howitzer
1 . F. H. 18 was modified so that the muzzle velocity of the weapon
could be increased. The Germans accomplished this by preparing
a new propellant charge (Fern ladung-long range charge)
which increases the muzzle velocity from approximately 1,542 feet
per second to 1,772 feet per second, and the range from approximately311,670
yards to 13,500 yards . To compensate for the increased
velocity and the resulting recoil, the Germans found it
necessary to add a muzzle brake. It was also necessary to slightly
modify the recoil mechanism and to increase the nitrogen pressure
in the counterrecoil cylinders from 730 pounds per square inch to
854 pounds per square inch. To differentiate between the two
models, the letter "M" (Mundungsbremse-Muzzle Brake) was
added to the old nomenclature, hence the later model is known as
the 1 . F . H. 18 (M).
The tube is of monobloc construction . The weapon has a
continuous pull firing mechanism and a breech mechanism of the
horizontal sliding type. The carriage, of riveted and welded steel,
is equipped with split trails, folding spades, wooden wheels with
rubber tires, and a protective armor shield 4 mm thick . It also
has hand operated friction brakes .

the machine gun tripod mount, M2 . It
is equipped with a pistol grip and is fired
from the back plate trigger .
As used by motorized and mechanized
units the gun is installed on mounts of
various types, depending upon the type
of vehicle and the position of the gun
thereon. It is customary to carry a tripod
mount, M2, for each gun to adapt the
weapon for ground use.
Barrels of the M1919A4, A5, and A6
guns are 24 inches long, 5 .37 inches
longer than the barrel fitted to the
1\11919A2 . The barrel sleeve has been
correspondingly lengthened from 13 .7
inches to 19 .08 inches . Separate front
barrel bearing plugs are provided to
permit the use of either 1111 or 1112
ammunition .
The M 1919A2 gun was also modified
by the addition of a belt feed lever group
assembly which permits assembly and
disassembly of the lever from above .

The trunnion block was equipped with a
bunter plug to resist wear by the points
of the bullets .
Further modifications have been made
since the weapon was designated 11T1919-
A4. These include substitution of a buffer
plug, buffer ring, and buffer disks for
the older tapered form of plug with ring
and filler. The change eliminates the
"freezing" of ring and plug which retarded
buffer spring action.
The bottom plate has been redesigned
so that plate, stirrup, and elevating
bracket are now a unit . The bottom
plate is riveted to the receiver and a
recess in the plate serves to locate the
gun in the pack hanger .
SIGHTS-Sights are of the conventional
machine gun type with the front

principal modifications, shown in the
illustration herewith, include a shoulder
stock, a carrying handle, and a bipod
ount fixed to the barrel sleeve. A new
front barrel bearing was provided and
the cover latch changed to permit easier
opening of the cover . Changes were made
in the barrel plunger and driving spring
to assure proper functioning without the
muzzle plug.

DUAL-PURPOSE MACHINE GUN
7.92 mm M. G. 34
The M.G. 34 is a standard machine gun of the German
Army. It cannot be compared directly with any American automatic
weapon . It is a multi-purpose weapon and is used as a light
machine gun, a heavy machine gun, an antiaircraft machine gun,
and also on tanks and other vehicles . Because of its adaptability,
it is the most common automatic weapon used by the German
Armed Forces .
Without bipod mount, the M .G. 34 weighs 24 1/4 lb., and
is occasionally fired by the use of a second soldier's shoulder as
a rest. A light bipod adapts it for prone fire and with tripod mount
this becomes a heavy machine gun.
The M.G. 34 is a recoil-operated, gas-assisted weapon, beltfed,
and air-cooled. It operates on the Solothurn rotating bolt-head
principle . A simple mechanism makes it easy to exchange a
heated barrel for a cool one . It is designed to deliver semiautomatic
or full-automatic fire .
Studies at Aberdeen Proving Ground show that it is very easy
to disassemble in the field, but cannot be regarded as an easy
gun to manufacture on a mass production basis, as compared with
the M.G. 42.
Studies of captured guns show that this weapon has a high
rate of fire-too high for a light machine gun-resulting in poor
accuracy in full-automatic operation. When used as a heavy
machine gun it shows excellent stability . It is extremely critical as
to adjustment, lubrication, and foreign matter.

DUAL-PURPOSE MACHINE GUN
7.92 mrr. M.G. 34 41
The German 7 .92 mm machine gun, M.G. 34/41, represents
one of the later developments of the M.G. 34. These developments
occurred in the following order : the M.G. 34; M.G. ' 34
modified ; M.G. 34s; M.G. 34/41 . In the course of development,
the original pattern of the weapon has been largely retained, but
each stage has tended toward simplification and elimination of
machined parts.
The M.G. 42 is a new design but has the same tactical employment
. It is distinguished by a high cyclic rate of fire and
fewer machined parts. The M.G. 42 is described on a separate
page.
The M.G. 34 modified is used principally in armored vehicles
and differs from the M.G. 34 in that it has a heavier barrel jacket
adapted to fit ball-type tank hull mounts, a simplified firing-pin
nut lock, and bipod clamps for attaching bipod in emergency use ;
it has no A .A. sight bracket. It can also be mounted on antiaircraft
and heavy ground mounts .
The M.G. 34s and the M.G. 34/41 are identical in appearance,
except for the barrel jackets, but are marked as distinct models .
They differ from the M .G. 34 as follows : provision for full-automatic
fire only; simplified trigger group; shorter barrel with
enlarged muzzle end ; elimination of firing-pin lock nut ; large buffer
group; heavier recoil spring ; modified feed mechanism. These
models can be used on antiaircraft mounts but appear designed for
the heavy ground mount.

RECOILLESS SRDULDRR WEAPONS, INCLUDING THE RAZOOBA AND PANZZHFAUST
The first widely used recoilless shoulder weapon was the
U.S. 2.36" bazooka. It was copied by the Germans, who produced and
used an 86mm shoulder rocket launcher . This larger German weapon
has en SAT head capable of penetrating more ermor .
An outstanding German development of which there is no U .S.
counterpart is the Panserfaut . Thio gives the German infantryman
a very powerful but very short-range antitank weapon .
The Ordnance Department has developed and recently standardized
a 57mm recoilless rifle which combines the power of an artillery
piece with the accuracy of a shoulder weapon, Although this has only
recently been introduced into the theaters, it promises to be the
outstanding recoilless shoulder weapon of the war .
The Japanese have no known weapons in this class, but they
probably will produce a copy of either the German or U.S. type.
RECOILLESS ANTITANK BOMB AND LAUNCHER
Panzerfaust
The German rocket grenade (Faustpatrone-literally "fist
cartridge") is a new close-range Nazi weapon used against tanks
and other armored targets . It comprises a tube and a head which
contains the explosive charge . The weapon weighs 11'/4 pounds,
has a muzzle velocity of 145 f/s, and a sight range of 33 yards .
The head, which is closed at the front end by a sheet-metal
cover, includes a semispherical hollow charge . Toward the rear,
the head merges into a rod which includes the small detonating
charge 34 and the fuze. The rear of the rod is screwed to a shaft
containing four bomb-fins for flight stabilization of the rocket
grenade. When not in use, the fins are rolled around the shaft
and held together by the tube which is slid over it. The propelling
charge is contained in the tube . A sighting rail, fixed to the front
end of the tube, when folded down serves as the safety against
involuntary cocking of the striker . The sighting rail itself is in turn
secured to the rear by the Fuze Safety Pin, which holds it in foldeddown
position . The lock is located on a line extending from the
sighting rail to the rear . It includes and carries the firing-pin
(striker), release button, and safety catch .
For firing, the weapon is taken under the right arm, the left
hand supporting the grenade two inches behind the front end of
the tube . The fuze safety-pin is pulled out, and the sighting rail
is snapped up, forming an approximate right angle with the tube .
The striker is cocked by pushing the lock forward until the striker
is set and the release button emerges . The lock then slides back
into its original position, and the release button is pressed, discharging
the projectile . Discharge is recoilless, and caution must
be taken, as a stream of fire from one to two yards long is ejected
from the rear of the tube . The launcher tube is expendable.
A smaller model is known as the Faustpatrone.

ANTITANK ROCKET GRENADE
8.8 cm R. Pz. B. Gr.
igtt
PROPELLANT CHAIrBER
This projectile is used with the German counterpart of the
"Bazooka." It weighs 7.3 pounds and consists of a bomb, propellant
chamber, and fin unit . The nose percussion fuze is similar to
that used in the high-explosive rifle grenade (Gewehr Spreng-
Granate) and the 3 .7 cm stick grenade (3.7 cm Stielgranate 41) .
This fuze is armed by setback .
The bomb body is divided into two parts which are held together
by a circular band crimped onto the two halves. The upper
section contains a cone forming the hollow charge. The booster
charge (Kz. Zdlg. 34 No .) is located in a cavity at the base of the
bomb. It is held in place by a few strips of paper . Beneath the
booster is a cylindrical block of wood .
The propellant chamber contains seven sticks of tubular propellant
200 mm long, 11 .6 mm in external diameter, and 5.6 mm in
internal diameter of the jets is 0 .5 cm (.19 in .) and the external
the center. The central stick contains a length of quickmatch in a
celluloid tube . There is no bottom igniter ; the top igniter is contained
in an aluminu holder. The composition is similar to that
found in other rocket rojectiles. It has a top covering of a celluloid-
like substance . Situated at either end of the propellant sticks
are grid-like spacers. The whole is kept in place by a jammed-in
locking ring . The tail unit contains a central venturi tube with an
electric fuze fitted to its outer end . Presumably, the electric fuze is
blown out on initiation, permitting the gases to escape . The projectile
does not rotate . I Attached to the outside of the electric fuze
is a length of insulated wire which is attached to a contact stud
fitted to a piece of wood .

In almost every situation the.most important
single, element of infantry : combat is the
effective use, of fire and movement.'
7.' Observation Y and seizure of dominant,
terrain. ,,
Experience ' continually . emphasized the
necessity of ;seizing key , terrain features
which afford effective observation . Enemy
positions-'subjected' to dominant observation
rapidly . became untenable. Examples of this
experience are quoted, from the' . report of a
division commander ;
l' his 'principle has been taught
for years, yet at EL GUETTAR,
HILL '772 remained in German hands
during the first ten days of the battle .
As a ,result the enemy, had artillery
observation and was able to. fire on. anything
that moved . As soon as HILL
772 ;was captured, the German's abandoned
the, entire position .;' . . .
The principle was further borne out
in'the SEDJENANE-BIZERTE opera,
tion ' During the early days while our
enveloping force was getting into, position,
German' observation', again dominated`..
us. Our envelopment turned
ture ;; omts,, for 'artillery ,,observation
,posts was';;emphasized,;and,its importance 'has,
been,' clearly ,-stated in, the .:comment of an
artillery battalion, executive,:"
air , of every',` infantry attack
'should' be directed to' seize high ground
for :`artillery ; OP's: Without -- them,
continued'effective, - support .cannot' be
given.
8. Organization' and consolidation of cap-,
tured'Iround.
Experience': has shown' that; German forces
, invariably :launch an immediate counterattack
whenever,possible to ,regain:lost ground, and
-,precede-o:such :`attack, with , prepared : artillery,
vanelng units-:had ., to :''Jedrn to . take
immediate measures for::the : organization of
captured' ground for:' defense' and to utilize
supporting weapons of all calibers for this
urpose., On' high ground , ridge, lines had to
e"avoided as, these features` often presented
targets for ;prepared, aAMery, . concentrations
which preceded counterattack, , ,'The following
examof pthils ;,eless,on,, is . taken from the.
.:.report' .-of a division commander :
everal times, , the infantry was
w to realize .' that they.., must not ex

I
r
the enemy out - of :,.the iine~;`,of ' hills..,o
which' his :OP's : were . located ~ ,It : is,;
now known that the German - ;'with'
drawal from the', GREEN 'HILL
BALD HILL position started : immediately
after we occupied the' two'hills :
referred to . .
Similar experience has been described' ;in the
report of another division commander :H~
AT EL GUETTAR,: the adyance
of the' Division was slow ' `and -'costly;, ,
until the -th Infantry captured' and'
strongly garrisoned the dominant . hill,
in the division sector . .Several, :OP's ::
were set up and observed .. fire;,wa's of
fectively'employed over the', entire sec-`'+
for thereafter, . As , another : example,,
in the operations- around'BEJA HILL
575 and HILL 350,: were dominant`terrain
features from which thej ;enemy
conducted a very strong defense ;Each
was captured by ..local attacks `'and
enemy resistance m " that `immediate
area crumbled as the advantage of" ob
""nervation passed to our. hands
In all offensive ' operations, the ;seizure o
dominant terrain features as intermediate,and
final objectives became the core-of infantr
commanders' plans, Specific ;effort to cap10.
Depth in offense and defense.
The principle of depth as applied to both offense
'and defense cannot, , be overstressed.
Disposition' and deployment' in depth, and the
mutual,'. support of all heavy and automatic`
weapons. from, positions organized in depth
.were found essential throughout the campaign;
In defense ; against armored attack, adherence
to this principle was vital.
11. Following'of artillery fires'and concentrations,
Assault.' troops learned . the advantage ; and
necessity;: *of'_ following closely the line of
impact.:of their supporting artillery concentrations
and barrages .., The distance between
assault wave , and concentration or barrage .
depends on terrain and other conditions. Reports
have indicated from 100 to 200 yards
as`effective distance without undue casualties
from " the supporting fire. Following at
greater distance allows the enemy to recover
from the shock of the ' fire and man his
weapons effectively . "This was conclusively
5556i0°-43-2
pose themselves on the skyline' after
reaching the top of a hill,, ; ;. The '';German
always places artillery fire' on,
positions he has vacated . '' In the attack
on DJEBEL CHENITI *by the
-th Infantry, advance elements stood
up on the skyline instead of, continuingdown
the forward slope and digging in .
Artillery` fire -came down almost, immediately
causing many more ,casualties
, than were suffered in ' taking" tl Le
position. . .
9. Infantry cooperation with tanks .
The Campaign has demonstrated that' ex
cellent results can' be obtained through 'the
use of tanks with .the . troops of the infantry ,
division, as distinguished' from the normal
action of the armored infantry . It has been
found that their employment. should , follow,
the principles of cooperation,, teamwork, - and-.
coordination required for the infantry-artillery
team . Two types of infantry coopera
tion were effective, as determined by' the'
situation. Preliminary preparation for the
breakthrough of the tanks, and close' support
of the tanks in their own breakthrough . In
either case, infantry support has been indispensable
to' the tank . action, especially in
c
ti'
e di
consolidating ' the . ground overrun by the ,
tanks
abandon,: strongly; defended positions 'at the :
heads. of,the 'corridors,,'valleys, :, and .natural ;;
approaches "We :learned " wrote' a division
commander at the close otfhee: campaign,
that, to live, we : must take to the
ridges and : advance along them, avoid
ing; :avenues of 'approach up valleys:
To ;; advance along valleys was . disastrous
;, ,. Taking to the^ ridges : was tedious,'.,
strenuous business' but . it saved
hundreds of .lives and gave physical
possession : of, the .high ground. Four
times this resulted in the collapse' of
strong positions,; and the"-,German was
finally ;: driven into, open country, his
resistancberoo :en, ; an , pursuit tactics
made' possible
3. Scouting and patrolling .
Scouting? ; and':patrolhng :proved to be one
of the most' serious deficiencies in the opera-
.tions of, American infantry in, Tun isia. Pa-'
trop activity, was not su fficiently .' aggressive, .
and . at times>;failure in effective scouting op-

cessity of seizing and holding the initiative
Ahrough ;gontinuous ,. aggressive and effective
scoutingh .and,-- .patrol ; operations. Our ex-
I 4
. .
demonstrated," 'reported a ' - Division, -, ommander,
who cited - the following examples :''
In early action, the infantry often
allowed artillery concentrations to lift'
so that 500 yards or more .had- to ; be' .
traversed before closing with the enemy.
This allowed the German to come :up
out of his dugouts and recover . fron the
effect of ;the` ; artillery and` man-!. weapons. As a result our attack" was'; -
often repulsed with heavy losses .
Later at DJEBFT, CHENITI
the -th Infantry stormed the hill fo1=
lowing the artillery at 100 yards They
took only three casualties from'.`our
artillery and overran the position with,
the bayonet't before the defenders had
recovered and manned their guns: No
casualties were suffered :,otherthree
mentioned above , ,
12. Training in mountain and hill warfare .
The recent campaign has shown that ` the
basic principles of mountain and hill war-'
fare must be learned by all infantry . .,' ,'In',
order to advance successfully, ,troops .had lo
avoid natural corridors of approach, which
were invariably mined and heavily defended,
and work along ridges and . high terrain fea=
tures. In this way the enemy was'forced'to'
I'YI
i
perience has demonstrated the need . for much
higher proficiency in the subjects and func
tions requisite to these operations, including
map reading, the use of compass and, other
means of direction control, movement by
stealth, avoidance of ambush, and control of
patrolling personnel. Leaders of. p a t r o l s
must master the principles of the single objective,
individual initiative and responsibility,
alert observation, patience, clarity in the
issuance and understandng of plans and instructions,
boldness of action, accuracy in reporting,
and energy and initiative in ex ecu
tion. Prior daylight reconnaissance should
precede night patrol operations to insure
against elements getting lost or ambushed.
These principles have been summarized in the
comments of a regimental S-2, whose unit saw
continuous action throughout,the campaign :
. . . Train men intensively in 'sneaking'
and 'peepin', and 'in how to distinguish
and identify different sounds .
Teach men to step cautiously and silently,
to crawl noiselessly . Train them
in the accurate use of the compass night
and day, and in map reading. Also in
observation-half the information we
get is obtained from observation and
patrolling . . .
10
One important battle lesson has'
been the failure of junior officers to be
ice-clear and specific in instructions and
directions, . especially with regard to
patrolling, scouting, and night operations.'
For night patrol operations a
prior daylight reconnaissance must be
made. Without adequate prior dayli
ht reconnaissance, night patrols
o ten get lost . In one . instance failure
to' reconnoitre a position and an area
for a night operation resulted .in a patrol
..being ambushed by outposts unknown
to the patrol leader and his
men
In all night operations have but a
single, objective . Never split a night
patrol-always keep it intact . Let
every man on scout and patrol know the
situation clearly . Give each man a definite
job and the responsibility for
carrying it out . . . .
An all-important point : Train men
to report only what they see, and not
to include any personal interpretations
. One outstanding example lesson
was the twisting of information reported.
An observation post reported
that three Italians had been seen coming
down a certain hill . The information
was relayed as three battalions
coming''down the hill
J^
delaying:position"across :the, (BABES-GAFSA-A
road " :'In' reporting, this incident, the division'commander
stated' :'
The' opmion'.was 'that resistance .
would ;.be light, ,and ma , intimation was
given of the presence of a strongly or
ganized defensive : position , As. it
turned ; out, ~ the ~ Germans must hve
worked two months on their, position,
Emplacements and dugouts were carved
out of the rock in many places, .
The fact that there was no' information
of the .'great strength 'of this position
had a .vital bearing on the plan of at-,
tack , In marked contrast was the
situation at SEDJENANE . There,we
relieved the British -th Division, and
were I furnished maps" giving all the detail$
; of, ',the ; - German positions Ion
GREEN 'and BALD HILLS and at the
head of the'' SEDJENANE valley. . As
a: result an enveloping' maneuver was
carried out avoiding all prepared' posi-
Aions. -' Each' enemy position was evacuated
,'as'soon as the ;pressure' of the
envelopment was felt
.15. Training in all phases of night opera•
tions
In the; recent . campaign, a large proportion
of the' infantry ;:operations, were carried out
la'
1
The importance of accurate map reading` an
interpretation are clearly' demonstrated : in the
report of a division commander , at' the- .conelusion
of the campaign :
At FONDOUK, and' :HILL` 609
this division had great difficulty, in map ,
reading: .' Officers had difficulty 'in. ac-.`
curately locating, themselves on map's,
and in following on the ground a route'
marked on a map . There are instances
of whole battalions becoming lost' at
night on the ,way to the jump-off line.
These incidents all bring out : the `'fact'
that map reading has been' neglected
and must, in the future, be continually
stressed in training . . ,
14. Securing and use of accurate G-2 information.
The securing of accurate and timely. G-2
information by intelligence personnel ;' .ivas
stressed in several of the reports . In all
echelons from the battalion intelligence sec-'
tion to the division G-2, the principles 'o f -.
accuracy, timelines, thoroughness, ' and, alert
action must be learned and followed . , In 'one
instance, intelligence' agencies f urnished''a
division G-2 with an overlay showing, German
mortars and probable infantry; positions
on the slopes of DJEBEL, -BERDA '.and' a"`

`b ,The ;~use of
:
highly,'trained 'snipers"as=
sumed''increasing, .importance throughout the
campaign. The` development'and effective use
of snipers' s ould be' given special attention.
c. The maintenance of ,uninterrupted controt
of 'all': combat elements in action ;,is'essen-;
tial: , All `leaders - and commanders must learn
to meet > this requirement and' . develop the
,ability to 'cope with sudden changes in the,
situation,; without; . loss of? control.
d. The'.use of smoke in different phases of
infantry,, :.operations assumed unexpected degrees,
of. importance. , The employment of,
smoke'' grenades, ,artillery 'cooperation with
smoke -'shell,', mortar smoke shell, and other
apparatus, all proved' highly effective . Smoke,
,was used .' for',r both offensive : and defensive
operations, for marking and identifying'
positions, ;targets,; and objectives .
e. Effective ;support from mortars and'arillery
frequently' depends on the work of
orward 'observers . In some infantry regitmentsofficers
; had learned the, technique of
?adjusting .;mortar, and . artillery fire by for-
-,ward observation methods . ' This provided a
at night. The standard of proficiency of our .
troops was initially unsatisfactory, but Improved
as experience was,gained . Two vital
needs were served by the improvement of our.
night operations
a. The essential element of surprise , when
needed.
b . The only means, 'at times, of getting
troops into position without severe' losses.
The essence of successful night ; operations
has been found to be simplicity of plan . The
subdivision of duties must be clearly understood
by all participants, and the individual
responsibilities assumed and carried out with'
vigor and dispatch . Such planning must
provide for continuous, effective control by
the leader or commander ; and for alternate
action in the event that unforeseen .develop
menu arise.
16. Miscellaneous.
In addition to major subjects above summarized,
the reports of +division and lower
unit commanders brought out the following
miscellaneous points :
.
a. Small unit training, especially with regard
to platoon and. junior leaders, is of prime
importance. The leadership, tactics, and
14
t
kf;'
reserve of forward 'observers w o were ,
great value in emergency
f. Coordination'; of all heavy:.~',supporting
weapons is of rsunpor anc ensive
and defensive operations . It must : include
the coordinated, planning.' of. fires ;for machine
guns, cannon company weapons, supporting
artillery, and mortars .
g. Proficiency in small-arms marksmanshi
and the ability to',hold . fire until aargets' 'ar
within range, were not fully; achieved,,'iri't
campaign.

(2) , In retrograde movements, when
communications are often lacking ; or inadequate,
individual, batteries may, often have to
cover the withdrawal of the , infantry' and
other artillery units . . ` Under .' these circumstances,
;, much will depend on! the observed
fires of individual ,batteries, without assistance
from'' the, fire 'direction' center . In one .
instance it has been `'reported - that "a single
105mm howitzer, covered the'' withdrawal -of
the 'remainder of 'its battery and'. neutralized
6=gun German battery all by itself."
(3) In a majority of different combat
operations, the : targets of opportunity that
appear, should betaken' under fire by individ
ual batteries' conducting their own observed
fire, either from established battery OP's or by
forward observers. In this connection, a division
commander, xeported at the close of
the campaign
In iall,'of our battles, . many favorable

located on the opposite flank,, .
c. Observed fire and forward observation .-
The great majority of all fires delivered . by
division and reinforcing artillery'. were con-'
ducted 'by some type of observation . In:'one
division it was reported that, "there was prac
tically no unobserved fire except ' harassing':
fires at night." The preponderance of ''ob
served fire was largely due ;to' the nature o
the terrain, which afforded ridges ; hills;'and
mountains for observation posts, and was alsowell
suited for forward observation methods.
Three special situations have been . encount=
eyed, and ' probably will' be encountered'` in,
future operations, that make mastery of,all :,
observed fire methods essential to, the smaller
units, especially the battery and platoon'; ':
(1) In assault landings, when; the support
artillery often enters action by section ;
platoon, or battery, and there is no fire direc
tion center in operation in initial :, stages, ;
Under these conditions the delivery of . sup
porting fire depends entirely on "the -ability
of the platoon and battery commanders . to.
conduct effective observed. fire .

Forward 'observation pr,oved to be the most

cases. In one' 'division it is,'reported' `that

and tactical principles of field artillery communication
as prescribed in standard training
literature . The need for proficient' signal
personnel, including men with ability to maintain
equipment and resort to improvisation
in difficult situations was emphasized by all
participating commanders . Artillery signal
troops must also develop a high degree of
ingenuity in establishing 'and maintaining
communications under all conditions . Wire
remains the primary means, of artillery communication,
with radio as a secondary or
emergency channel. The highest cooperation
and understanding between wire and' radio
personnel is essential to insure the combined
use of both means when 'the situation demands.
In so, me rapidly moving situations,
wire has been reported as the secondary channel,
though this should be regarded as an ex- .
ception to the general rule. Telephone and
radio discipline is vital, to prevent traffic
blocking. In . all artillery communications,
flexibility has been of cardinal' importance All units reinforcing the fire of another unit,.
or in direct' support, must provide communications
with the unit so reinforced or supported.
Lateral communications between bat
talions is important, and lateral communications
.between the division' artillery of adja -
cent divisions is of even greater importance.
Prearranged message ,codes, and a complete
and effective SOI are essential.
e. Unobserved fire.-In 'future operations,
the terrain may' not, afford such excellent
means of observation as have been experienced
in the Tunisian Campaign . In their reports,
division commanders have pointed out that
the principles and technique of prepared un-,
observed ;, fires must not: be overlooked, but
must be'mastered by all units . Emphasis was
given in'these reports to transfers of all types,
and to delivery of unobserved concentrations
and the: massing of . fires .

new ained,'positions;; ' .;The importance . of
this pomt-, is . brought out by , one of the'divislon
, commanders in his ; report ;,on 'battle
experience
The artillery with this division
killed more Germans, when they made
these' counterattacks than it did ,in'all .'
the preparation, fire' on Aargets-of ., op
portunity, counter-battery, "and; in sup
port,'during attack In~'.fact,',the BAR
ENTHIN Regiment must have learned ;;
'its lesson the hard .,way,, because, on the
`'last, position, it refused to counterattack.
(6) '. In'' some ; : instances' : bog- barrages
were used effectively:' .to extricate hardpressed,
infantry elements from difficulty.
(7) : Rolling barrages"" were . used ; on
some `occasions :", More , generally, to cover the
assat}it" .'of' infantry, concentrations were fired
at prearranged .times determined after . consultation
.: with the infantry.. These concentrations
;were of sufficients:duration to permit ,
the` assaulting.'. infantry toll press close to ; the

l t , ?rounds' of such', concentrations were
smoke to signal the lifting'of the . fire. II
ing battalions'a.t all times without calling on
division artillery headquarters' to get the fire
The advantage of high speed in' delivery of
reinforcing fire was obtained ;through ; this
system. It is reported very eff ective', in' a l
cases where it has been used.'
(3) Another, method of controlling the ::
fires of reinforcing' or general support' units
was the placing of them under .tcohntero-l
of the division artillery gunnery officer who
assigned them missions on - call for help . from'"
the direct support battalions . ' This' method
has been found to be especially effective when the amount of general support artillery is`
limited.
(4) Experience 'has shown'' that `rigid'
adherence to combat-team organization in a
division action : often results ' in complicating'. .:
and reducing artillery support. In any'
method of controlling the fire of "'organic and
attached units, all battalions must`always, be
available and under the command of the division

(8) The effectiveness of time fire with
HE shell cannot be exaggerated . Properly
used, this type of fire has proved to be
annihilating.
(9) Experience has demonstrated that
long concentrations of slow fire are more effective
against prepared positions than a mass
of fire for a short duration . This doe's not
apply to enemy in the open. The . enemy,
themselves substantiate this experience, according
to one division commander's report
Many prisoners testified that `the'
combination of percussion 'shell," time
shell, and white phosphorus took the
fight out of them, not only because it
was practically impossible to avoid the
effect, but also because the continuous
pounding shattered their nerves . .. .
(10) The importance of liaison functions
to artillery operations was borne out
in the campaign . The experience of one di' i
sion is briefly stated in the report of its
commander :

forms of. (artillery) control, and, is essential
not only between' artillery,, and

factor'.which `determines:' the responsibility

21. Armored forces in the offensive.
a.' .Offensive action is the keystone 'of all
armored' force ; operations; Even in defensive
situations, the primary role of armor
is that'' of counterattack .
b. Mass action and concentration of determined,
effort are the two; essential elements
in successful' offensive action . The coordination
:of' all . supporting and cooperating troop
elements must be achieved in , order to give
the armor its full advantage, The hostile
front must be'skilifully reconnoitered, probed -
by'reconnaissance ,in 'force when necessary,
and the weak and strong points in the enemy's
defenses accurately determined, The mass of
armor;' assisted, by -massed artillery fire, closely
followed by ;cooperating infantry to hold the
9
e. ; Another lesson from, the,`campaign ; stems
from the inaccurate picture of sp,eed'and'agd
gressiveness that ., had ` been common m `. the,
United States with''regard to armored action,, ;'
Units must not, charge blindly info action :with
the reckless audacity '' associated: with the'
overworked ; phrase ;~of "blitzkrieg'' Ori the
contrary;', they must work forward steadily;
skillfully ;' and 'with. determination, utilizing
every means",, of,,,reconnaissance and" covering,,
fire that are at .the disposal of the command :
f: Armored units must' be recognized '',an

gains, must be hurled against the known weak
segment of the enemy line, and the penetra ; ,
tion exploited to the -,fullest esxLteaednintgI,,
elements, must be prepared to ,,take initial
losses in order, that the following'mass ma
push through and achieve suceess:, :'
c. Attack formation in depth is of vital!, .'
importance to offensive' armored action . The .
rear elements must be able to , push through' . '
the leading units, in order to; exploit ; the lat'
ter's gains, and-carry the blow' forward, ' The
attack should be launched on a . narrow ; front,
which will give added strength to the depth
of formation, and deny the enemy oppor
tunity to bring more than part, of his weapons
to bear in defense . The habit of attacking
all along the line must be avoided,
d. The concentration of artillery fire. is ..a
prerequisite to success. On ' , battalion - of
tanks forming, the leading element', of , an , as
sault should have, all three battalions of artillery
in support. : One artillery battalion
should smoke areas adjacent to the 'objective
to nullify . hostile flanking fire . The remaining
two battalions should deliver, heavy concentrations
on the objective . The ; armor can
run in close to the :supporting : artillery fire :
without probability of material damage.; The
40

concentrated, 'artillery:fire .including 'air-burst
will'::'serve .' to:,. neutralize' antitank'-guns
e way' of the' advance. .
: Specific missions -. , for: the` armored ele-,
ments,' ; proper tuning, thorough, preparation';
and? complete understanding of the .' operation
y:all,,elements down to ;and including each
tank commander, are essentiall to success.
Earlier,, experience :showed the need of-these -
pr nciples'properly applied, as stated by one
at airnored division commandeerr :
We have been; inclined to move -
_o fast ; to attack at''a given,hour, or
on a given day without being ready ;',
without ;the `;.knowledge: :, of ;, the, plan
being' understood down to the lowest
elements ;, without' the availability of
ammunition 'and supplies necessary to - I .,su twin the, 'effort- and without the
command concentrated so that 'all ele
ments' can ' move : into ~ their attack
,missions on time : . .
It is better;: to delay an attack' until
later, in the' day or even' until a later
date and have ,, the attack thoroughly
prep, ared,.and' understood, rather thanto
be faced with the necessity' of stop ping the A attack in ' . order to', provide
enough impetus ; in troops 'and supplies
continue to success .
41
;s
L
displace, must be made sufficiently early to
prevent confusion during the movement, All r
units, must be informed as to the probable
location if a, displacement is contemplated .
An axis is not sufficient for the command
posts of elements that are engaged.
22. Armored forces in the defensive.
a., Armored .forces are' not . designed or
organized for' static defense . Their primary.,
purpose and tactical principle is offensivee
action..' -'Armored units defend by counter-
'atta'cking' at the right, time and the right
place to . disrupt and disorganize hostile attack.
b. General defensive principles applicable
to armor as well as to other arms have been .
thus summarized in an armored regimental,
commander's report of battle experience :
Armored units must learn to apply
the principle' of being strong at
the r}-ght spot and of avoiding attempts
at holding everywhere at the same
time. - It is better to give ground in
order to attack and defeat the enemy
in detail, . than to disperse strength by
trying -to ,watch every place that the
enemy might slip through . The armored
division has great possibilities
43
i
1
In similar tone, the commander, of an 'ar
mored regiment commented on 'the same
point in his report
. Tank operations must ' be conducted
on a perfected plan to be successful.
It is better to delay „ the
attack than to rush in to reach : a certain
objective by a certain time, without
sufficient, orders to subordinates or
sufficient rconnaissance. E n o u g h
time should be granted to make certain
that every subordinate commander
knows and understands the plan, the '
mission, adjacent troops, and the rally .
points . One of the most successful attacks
ever made by an organization of
this regiment was at HILL 609 . It
achieved its high degree of success because
all commanders concerned appreciated
the fact that \the German and
not time, was the enemy . .
f . The, assembly area for an armored attack
must provide concealment from hostile
ground observation . Where terrain, makes -
this impossible, the delay in the assembly
area' must be brief .
g . The command post must be well forward
in attack. When ordered to move, it
must displace quickly, and the decision to
42
11
with, the tank destroyer' elements ; 'part of the
armshoouldr, ,be : established ;in carefully
chosen ground in,hull-down position to check'
the advance of, enemy tanks with defensive,
fri,re. b. Tanks should never be kept,in the battle
zone when not' being actively employed, especially
during lulls or quiet periods . The
armor, ; must withdraw s from combat ; at, or
prior to , darkness, and be'' taken well back
to refit and. rearm;: Unnecessary holding' o£
tanks for several days in the front line mate-_
rially reduces their effective fighting strength
through; lack of maintenance..
When, armored forces are held for counterattack
purposes, they must be far enough
back, to permit' freedom of choice, of action,
even at the expense of loss of terrain . The. .
tanks must be kept concealed, and their movement
must be . as secret' as possible. To do
otherwise : will permit the enemy to count our
strength and match it, thus making our-counterattack'ineffective
.
d. Armored ; artillery is superior to towed
artillery in retrograde' movements . Its armor,
permitits,o to remain, longer in forward areas
to cover the withdrawal of foot elements .: : It <
can protect ;,itself reasonably, well against in
5'
"ri
f
is

I f
as a mobile reserve for rapid dispatch
to a threatened, spot to , crush hostile
attack by strong counterattack
c. Appreciation of terrain is of special'
importance in defensive action. : . Gr o u n d
which is valuable for . offense may become
worthless for defense . Commanders' should
not hesitate to abandon unsuitable ground
when the mission changes from offense to de-w=
f ense .
d. The necessity for clarity in instructions;'
especially for defensive missions, was .,thus''
reported by an armored regimental : com
mander
. , A mission "you will prevent the
debauchment of the enemy' through .
such and such a place" is incomplete' '
in that there ' is no limiting time factor ;
If the defender knows that he is to
"hold at all costs," his plan will be
different from that which contemplates'
holding until reinforced, or until some
other action is ordered , . .
23. Armored forces in retrograde, move-'
ments .
a. In retrograde movements, armored forces,
should be employed on the flanks to counterattack
the hostile pursuit . In 'cooperation
44
I
filtration during daylight, and it can in emer-"
gency provide protection against ' hostile
armored attack.
24. Armored infantry units.
a . The primary mission of the armored in
f antry is to assist, cooperate with, and fight'
in coordination with the armored elements of
the division. When occasion requires, armored
infantry fights as ordinary infantry,
and many of the lessons and experiences given
in Section II above, are applicable to the infantry
of the armored division . Such subjects
as fire and movement, scouting and patrolling,
observation, preparation for counterattack,
consolidation of captured ground,
depth in offense and defense, apply to all
infantry, whether armored or not .
b . The outstanding lesson with regard to
armored infantry is the prime necessity of
following up the advantage or gains achieved
by the tanks . Reports have shown that on a
number of occasions the supporting infantry
did not follow up and consolidate the ground
initially taken by the assaulting tanks.
Armored vehicles cannot hold ground indefinitely
after they have made their penetration
or have gained a position . If the
armored infantry .' do not `follow: quickly and'
.occupy, the ground gained by the armor, the
tanks ill eventually . be forced to withdraw,
and the potentially successful operation be-
.Comes , unsuccessful . The comments of the
commander of one of the armored combat
commands in' his report indicate that this
situation, prevailed in four major actions-
`pat TEBOURBA in December, OUSSELTIA
in February, KASSERINE in March, and at
MAKNASSY in April."
c.'' The tactical situation in each case must
determine the exact manner of employment
of armored infantry . Whether it will precede
the' tanks and prepare the way for their
thrust, whether. it will follow in the wake of
the armor and exploit and consolidate the
gains, 'or, whether a combination ''of both will
'be used-all depend on the nature of the objective,
the terrain, and the situation in
general.
d. One function important in the action of
armored ,infantry is the stalking and silencing
of antitank weapons, locating them and relaying
their positions to the artillery, and' in
general, serving as a means of eliminating this
threathet, 'atdvaoncging armor . "Experience
has,. proven," , .wrote- the- commander of one
47 '
5
of the combat commands, 'at least, in ttie
Tunisian Campaign, that the antitank gun 'is ,
to be avoided (by . advancing tanks), as much . ;'
as possible, and attacked only as a last re-,'
sort." The skillful use of determined , infantry,
supported by artillery, to locate, and
attack these guns will make for success of the''
armored elements. ,
25. Armored field artillery units,
a. Armored field artillery :'is generally,
capable of being employed',in a manner, .simr
larr to that of ordinary' artillery, and the :'
lessons and experience relating to' division,
field artillery in section III also apply to the
artillery of an armored division . In addition;'
armored field artillery: possesses the character;.
istics of mobility and maneuverability in . .
somewhat higher degree than in the 'case°'of
ordinary towed artillery . It, must be aggres .
sively used at all times in offense, and because
of its armored, self-propelled carriages it can
be placed well forward in support. The loca- -
tion and disposition of enemy,, installations
govern' how far forward armored . artillery .
should be placed. It 'should be gut of ,range .
of heavy machine 'gun fire and light mortar
fire, and it should seek position defiladed from
48
f
t
fiat-trajectory antitank, weapons. ' 'Its'' positions'
should ;afford a reasonably well' defiladed
approach,;;for ammunition ,vehicles which ,are
not armored :
b ; In defensive situations, armored artillery
has' been, found to possess certain ; advantages
over towed-''artillery, and -'also'' disadvantages
not,: presenti in the latter. Because . of its
armor .it-'can, remain longer m forward areas

(6) Dispersion within the battery position
cannot be too much stressed, The battery
front should approach 250 yards.
(7) Armored artillery is essentially
support, artillery. It should be employed for
direct fire only in case .its own positions are
attacked.
(8) Each member of the gun crew
should; be trained in the duties of all other

of all large units, and to reconnaissance organizations
in general . The experience'.,in
eluded in the following paragraphs' is, taken
from the report of the armored ;reconnais-,
sance battalion of the division which partici
pated in the campaign .
b . ' The action of reconnaissance units . mus

c. The basic principles of action' y',reconnaissance
troops have been proven sound b
combat experience. Failure to apply them .,;~
properly has been the chief cause of- unsuc
cessful operations. The, following causes have
been given in most cases as those responsible
for unsuccessful execution ' of reconnaissance
missions
(1) The issuance of orders that .are not`-
unmistakably clear and concise :" 'Ths is'ap

ports should be rendered . even if there is nothing
new, to report. Negative information is
often as valuable as positive . ' Reporting
agencies must not include interpretation 'of
what they have seen.' The simple formula
of what, where, and when, without embellishment
must be the rule .
(6) An armored reconnaissance bat=
talion commander recommends that a form
of SOP be incorporated into the training of
all officers and platoon NCO's, something like
the general, orders for interior guard, and
that all concerned know this SOP thoroughly .
To illustrate this point he gives the following
example
.A'platoon halts. The commander
immediately applies this SOP, such as
the following
(a) Know where I am on ground
and map.
(b) Provide for full security .
.(c) Dig in if we are to remain for
any length of time.
(d) My men lmow the mission and
the situation.

to reach objectives because, of their inability

e. The following miscellaneous points have
been emphasized in the reconnaissance battalion
commander's report :
(1) In reconnaissance operations of
any appreciable size, a reserve must be held'
out.
(2) In night reconnaissance,-the use .
of vehicles in forward areas must be avoided .
A vehicular crew is both deaf and blind
against hostile dismounted patrols, which ;can , :
easily dispose of vehicles .
(3) Radio security in reconnaissance
patrol operations must be improved
.
(4) Information' from, reconnaissance
units must be disseminated to lower units
without delay. It is of utmost importance
that intelligence data reach the front line
units so that it can be acted on at once .
(5) Reconnaissance reports must'' be
frequent, accurate, and ice-clear. Hourly re
SECTION V-TANK DESTROYER UNITS"'
27. Experience in the Tunisian Campaign
reveals that some of the fundamental princi
pies prescribed in training literature have
been misinterpreted. The main lesson from
the campaign resulted from misconception of,
the idea of "offensive action." Destroyers
must not be used to "hunt tanks ." Neither
can they be used as tanks in a fire fight with*
tanks without disastrous losses.
28. The campaign has demonstrated that the
maneuver of tank destroyers largely depends
on the existence of concealed routes of ap
proach, and on the degree of enemy observa=
tion from both observation posts and direct
firing antitank guns. The concept of "seek,
strike, and destroy" must be modified to meet :
existing conditions and the capabilities and
limitations of the destroyers as applied,
to the situation and mission. This idea of
aggressive action must also be applied' to
units and not to single vehicles or small
groups of vehicles. As stated by the' 'com
mander of the destroyer group which partic
ipated in the campaign, "an indavidzwl .
destroyer has not the means to, accomplish
vigorous reconnaissance to locate hostile
56
tanks." Likewise experience has shown that -
tank destroyers, unless in coordination with
other arms, .,can seldom strike, at vital object
ives; The ..: best method of employment in
the campaign was found to be that of establishing
abase, of fire and giving close direct,
support to other antitank elements from hull
'down . positions . 'Destroyers must'' not chase'
tanks. " They, .. 'should reconnoiter for . ,the',
approach, of enemy' :,.tank formations and' be
prepared t6:-; meet . them with defensive fire
from selected,hull-down`positions, Every ef=.
fort -must be' : made to establish tank traps into
which the ; .hostile; tanks . may, be drawn and
destroyed, .;;..
29. Attached tank destroyers should not be
employed in the role of static antitank guns
Occupying,hull-down positions for defensive
fire' does not' imply restriction of movement
to avoid artillery fire, to occupy alternate,
supplementary, or cover positions, or ' on
change , of location : when advantage may be
gained. .
30. 'Destroyers -must be used . in ' numbers.
.The tendency. of . some commanders of larger
units to,which TD -battalions have been at
tithed, in attaching companies, platoons, or
even sections to small task forces should be
discouraged. The battalion is the most ' of-'
fective unit in action . Piecemeal employment
is to be avoided the same as in armored forces .
31. Campaign experience has shown that
tank destroyer units in addition to their primary
role, can be profitably employed on
special missions when it is known that there
is no threat from enemy armor. These operations
included such missions as reconnaissance
in force, advance guard for special combat
forces, artillery support, and mine and
booby trap removal . All these missions were
performed successfully, and indicate the versatile
possibilities of the organizations - in
addition to their primary mission . It must
be emphasized that these special operations
were undertaken only at times when there was
known to be no impending threat from hostile
armor .
32 . Fighting in Tunisia has clearly indicated
the necessity of sound training in mine warfare
and booby trap clearing for tank . destroyer
units . Destroyers must often operate
in areas that have been mined and booby
trapped, and must frequently carry out operations
without assistance from engineers . In
58
establishing tank traps, destroyer units must
be capable of using mines offensively .
33. Effective camouflage, concealment, and
the use of cover are vital to successful destroyer
operations . Combinations of such
measures as coloring vehicles with soil, mud,
paint and other, media ; nets and other artificial
methods ; and the use of brush, debris,
and foliage have all been successfully used
in the recent campaign. The use of draws,
swales, hillocks, . natural folds, haystacks, and
even buildings for concealment and cover has
been found highly effective in the terrain
encountered.
34. The reporting commanders have stressed
reconnaissance as a never-ending function of
tank destroyer units . Reconnaissance for
ready, fire, alternate, supplementary, and
rally positions must be made before an action .
Alternate plans of action also require recon-,
naissance before such plans can be completed.
Commanders, at least down to platoon leaders,
'should 'reconnoiter the ground into which
they are to operate . Tank, destroyer units
should not be given missions properly belonging
to the reconnaissance troops or
battalions of divisions and corps . Their
reconnaissance fi4nctions shouldd be limit6d't
their own operations.
SECTION VI.-MINE WARFARE AND~,
B0 _BY TRAPS
35. Experience in the Tunisian Campaign
showed that. mine warfare has assumed far
greater tactical importance than had been
previously realized or anticipated. As d6-
Moped in the present war, the land mine and
the various types of booby traps have proved
'to be a most formidable and powerful weapon
and serious obstacle in the advance and operations
of all arms . Much has been learned
from the recent campaign, and this experience
should be utilized to every advantage in future
operations, especially in those conducted by
troops who have not yet entered action .
36, The most outstanding lesson derive&,i' .
.
from the campaign has been the realization
and understanding that detecting, , disarming,
and clearing mines and booby traps is no.
longer a special or exclusive function' of the
engineers . Although these operations are
primary functions of engineer troops , and
have expanded with the current developments .
in the war, it has been learned by experience
A=
that troops 'of all arms must be proficient' in
~ mine -warfare. , , In' many'` instances infantry'
, artillery, - and other organizations must take
.
care `of the mine problem 'in their own areas,
since' it often , becomes , impossible for , engineer
troops to cover every area where mines
have been laid.
1 37. Exposure to mines and booby,traps in the
numbers encountered in the recent campaign
necessitates the distribution of mine detectors
to all arms . ,, The general experience
of the infantry ,, divisions has led to their
recommendation 'for the allotment of one to
two detectors' per company, battery, . or troop.
Each unifof this, size must have from its own
.:personnel a squad or section fully , capable of
using the detector and clearing mines . Detecting
and clearing, as well as minelaying,
i s of. special importance to the reconnaissance
units of divisions and corps,
38. In ' forward areas where exposure to
,mines maybe expected,, all vehicles of lesser
weight than the standard 2Y2-ton truck should
be sandbagged . Experience has shown that
sandbags, while they do not prevent : damage
to vehicles, •have : often saved'. the lives of
personnel .
39. The dissemination of information con- ,
cerning mines, minefields, and booby-trapped
areas is of utmost importance to the safety
of a command. It is the duty of all headquarters
to see that information of this 'nature
reaches all echelons without delay . As
stated by one division commander,
A great many casualties suffered
by this Division through loss of personnel
and materiel by mines could
have been avoided had this information ,
been furnished everyone concerned .
40. Common German practice is to mine the
shoulders of roads, and seemingly unused
roads, tracks, or trails . Mines are also sown
freely throughout country suitable for mechanized
approach. Rough terrain not traversed
by paths or trails has generally been
found relatively free from mines. Road
craters,, blown culverts and the approaches to'
by-passes around blown bridges are generally,
heavily mined . The enemy has also created
effective delaying barriers by mining soft and,
sandy fords and by strewing them with metal
fragments to render detectors , ineffective . .,
The sporadic mining of long stretches of road
has been found to be another German method
of delaying advance .
62
41. The instruction and training principles
developed to combat mine warfare have
proved highly effective and sound . The mine.'
clearing drill developed in the Libyan Campaign
and further developed to meet the requirements
of all types of terrain has proved
entirely' satisfactory . Mastery of the mine
clearing, drill, understanding of all types and
combinations of mines, and confidence on the
part of personnel will serve to neutralize
the casualty effect of mine warfare . Nothing
effective as yet has been fully developed to
remove the delaying effect. The majority of
casualties from clearing operations have been
the result of violations of clearing drill teachings,
such as unnecessary movement in suspicious
areas, congregating in groups during
removal operations, improper detector swinging,
and lack of proper or orderly procedure
in clearing projects .
42. The commander of the armored division
participating' in the campaign has frankly
stated that
The antitank mine is one of the
greatest menaces to the operations of
-the , armored division. The antitank
mine has no present antidote except the

The selection of a site, for a minefield is of
vital importance, because once laid, the field
es .',the location of , .supporting weapons.
Ground'reconnaissance by capable representatives
of each arm is essential . - Once the field
is laid; itwill'determine'to'a large degree the
future-movements of all units in the area.
o. . Minefields require' constant attendance of
guards "to pass traffic through 'gaps and to'
keep livestock from entering ,and detonating
the- mines,, The field must also be adequately
protected `against hostile clearing or rushing
with armored vehicles Infantry protection
is necessary to prevent' breaching by hostile
clearing parties. In daylight the field can be
,;kept :finder observation and, under machine
gun and artillery fire . At . night listening
';`,posts, should ;' be established to detect the ap
.proach ;of` clearing parties . Sentinels in listening
posts should be equipped with flares .
Si;cTioN,' VII-DEFENSE AGAINST AIR
ATTACK
4 In the . Tunisian Campaign units of all
arms- were subjected'to air attack under various
conditions,' The experience of different
unit's'and' arms -varied considerably .' In one
5
slow process of picking up 'the : mines .,
by the use of detectors, of charging'
through the minefields at great loss of
tanks.
43. Mine warfare in its offensive phase has
been as important as defensive . . measures.
The minefield has . become a powerful' sec
ondary weapon, and its use must be thoroughly
understood. The following points
have been emphasized in the reports of'combat
experience :
a. Standardization of minefield markings, .
routes, and reports is absolutely essential .
It has been reported that at times our own
minefields have proved to be "more, disas
trous than those of the enemy." Troops of
all arms must be able to recognize standard
markings, and must maintain strict compli -
ance with minefield reports, sketches, routes,'
etc. ' A standard method should be prescribed
and taught before troops arrive 'in the battle!
zone .
b. The technique of laying minefields needs -
improvement, especially in night operations .
Coordination must be' obtained between the
organization selecting the sites and those re- .
sponsible for guarding and protecting them .
64
dug slit' trenches have given adequate protection
against the worst bombing . In artillery
positions, the. slit trenches . should be contiguous
to the gun pits .
f, Placing of all organic weapons suitable
for, antiaircraft, firing, and the .. attached antiaircraft
weapons and personnel, in suitable
position to defend the area. ;The training of
men to fire on hostile aircraft only when :
(1) The aircraft attack
(2) The attacking aircraft are within
range.
Fire on ,,aircraft which have' ,. not attacked
merely invites attack, and gives away the position,
or area and its extent, , This is especially
true of . hostile reconnaissance . planes, which,
when fired on, can ascertain the location and
extent' of the position and area and later return
with bombing formations .
g.
-
Manning of antiaircraft weapons at all
times, 'and posting of qualified air sentries in
carefully selected positions .
h. If the situation does not require otherwise,
artillery should remain ' silent when hostile'aircraft
are overhead.
i. Positive identification of aircraft is essential
before fire is opened. . The best identi-
67
division, 95% of all air attacks were -sus
tamed by the artillery. Certain lessons have .
been learned and certain principles of defense,
have received general concurrence by participating
units,
45. For positions, bivouacs, and assembly
areas, the following measures have been
proven effective against all types of air at
tack :
a . The use of every available means of concealment
and natural cover,
b. Effective camouflage measures, including
the use of all natural and artificial means .
In artillery units, the air observation aircraft
has proved invaluable for checking camou-,
flage and discovering defects .
c. Enforcement of the most rigid-- camouflage
discipline . It is not enough that a man .
observe proper discipline himself. He must,,
also take action to prevent others from 'committing
violations, since the safety of the command
is at stake.
d . Proper dispersion of vehicles, weapons,
and installations .
e. Proper digging in of personnel and materiel
whenever a position or area is to be
occupied for any length of time. Properly
66
l'
anise ;an re,, All otherpersonrielshould
dismoun al e'cover; and: fire every weapon'
that can`be':brought to bear on the aircraft.
A column, moving' through country subj
ect io air, attack ; should have all radios on
the 'command' channel ; with" operators listening
Ak warning 'can be thus spread from one
end of the column to the other from' any point
which may be attacked .
c. When in • march column and :air attack
is likely, the fire extinguishers should be loose
from their brackets, and ready to be taken
by the, assistant driver or occupant of the
cab, if the `vehicle' is evacuated . One man
should be defirntely responsible, for this func-
„tion Often an attack -is over very quickly,
and 'if the extinguisher is 'taken when the
vehicle is evacuated, measures can be taken
at`;onee, to `put out a fire : Otherwise the extinguisher
',ma .'become , enveloped m flames,
and the chance' of saving the : vehicle is, lost,
(:,'Spare; gasoline 'cans should, . not be carried'
in vehicles dispersed ." throughout the
column during, daylight marches, unless the,
existing; situation' makes such procedure imperative.
~ ; Many 7N, ehicles! have been , lost,
"through spare' gasoline : cans 'being hit by' in
68
a
fication under such circumstances is attack ;,by
the aircraft. In the campaign, identification
was unsatisfactory, and in many, instances
friendly planes were fired on and hostile air-'
craft were allowed to pass within range unmolested.
46. Road movements, convoy, and marches
have been subject to all types of air attack.
The following defensive measures have been
found effective for protection and for mini : ,.
mizing losses :
a. Dispersion in column is the most .-, vital,
single principle. The maintenance' of proper
distance between vehicles is essential . 'A distance
of 150-250 yards, depending on the
terrain should be the minimum . Violation
of distance regulations invites disaster .'
b . An air lookout must be posted.' on each
vehicle. Each air guard must be in~position'
to observe in, a 360° direction . If this is not
possible on some vehicles, a front and rear
lookout should be posted . Lookouts should be
relieved at frequent intervals, to prevent men
from becoming inadvertently lax.
. c. When a column is attacked, normally, it
should halt, spread to both sides of the ; road,
and all mounted weapons should' remain
k`.
cendiary bullets from strafing planes. If
the spare cans are carried in one truck at the
end of the column, this one vehicle may, be
lost, but there is far better chance of others
not taking fire .
47 . The .50 caliber machine gun has proved
to be the most effective antiaircraft weapon
in most situations . It should be properly
dispersed throughout march columns and
carefully placed in troop positions and occupied
areas. Attached antiaircraft units have
been best employed by breaking them up into
platoons and assigning them to organizations,
especially to the artillery, which is most subject
to air attack.
48. Air attack has been generally ineffective
against armored vehicles. It has been reported
that even dive bombing has failed - to
cause much damage to medium tanks. Tanks; ',"
when attacked in this manner should continue
to move, zig-zag fashion . . Deployed
tanks can furnish their own air protection
in the armored division . Proper antiaircraft
weapons must be provided for headquarters
and . service personnel,

2 . Air-ground support has not yet approached the satisfactory
stage . Air support must he :made more available to ground
combat units to enable them ;,o exploit air-mission targets
of opportunity .
3 . Some pyrotechnic form of signal identification is necessary
to prevent friendly aircraft from destroying our own tanks .
Present markings must be retained to permit such restricted
ground identification as now exists .
4 . Gasoline-powered tani :s are regarded by their crews as firetraps
. The men greatly prefer the less inflammable Diesel
^o-:veered tank .
5 . Tank officers point to the need for a range quadrant which
could permit them to fire H, from their heavy guns at wide
ranges .
6 . The frequency of penetration by enemy shell-fire on the turret
of the t1-4 tank indicEtes t at the recess of indent tinn
formed thereon for the fitting of arpliances has dangerously
weakened the vehicles defensive armor--in a critical area .
7 . Our current system of aircraft identification is variously
regarded as useless and wart less . Armored units fire on aircraft
only ;hen attacked for fear of exposing themselves to
reprisal ri ve-bomber attack .

"Here, like everywhere else, the lower echelons of command must

Maj . Gen. Ernest N. Harmon's Notes on Combat
Experience During the Tunisian and African
Campaigns
NOTES ON COMBAT EXP MIN•ICE
DURING THE TL NISIAN1 AID AFFICAN --AMPAICNS
By Major General E . N. Harmon
1. Most Essential Requirements for Combat :
In general,• our tactical doctrines are sound, the only requirement being
to place greater emphasis on some points and less emphasis on others . We need not
bow to any other ccuntry as to our military preparation . The Germans are superior
to us mainly in their thoroughness and greater discipline . I feel that we are
inc-lined to attempt to cram too much into the common soldier . Instead of teachirg
him .a few fundamental things thoroughly, we attempt to cover too wide a field, ::i •h
the result that when he arrives in the combat zone, he really is not thoroughly
I
compatent in anything and has to learn some of the most essential lessons in the
combat zone. I consider the following five points to b I he most essential req;iire--
ments for combat
'
a. Thorough and Completec Trininp for the Idiidld f Sll
basianvua anorma
Units.
This includes not only the, elementary basic training of the soldier
in all subjects such as discipline, camouflage, dispersion, sanitation, use of
cover, etc ., but above all, the use of his :reapons - perfection in ma rksmanship
and crew drill. Tank battles are usually won by the tanker who gets the first
shot in. Speed and accuracy are essential . Crew handled weapons must be worked
'at night and under heavy fire with speed, accuracy and without second thou at --
aatomaica 11
The leadership and responsibility of the small unit leaders as the
squad and platoon, the perfection of the training of : these units' must, be given -._
_greater emphasis and . less emphasis placed on the - dperation of the larger units
such as_ battalion, regiment, . and division. The division m•ir11 succeed only as he
ilaoon succeeds.
b. Development of the Offensive Spirit and Eagerness to Close with the
In the consideration of this subject we are up against one of the
imponderables . We never know just how green troops and officers will act . We may
be assured, however, that the first time in battle all officers and men will be
considering their own safety, more or less, rather than the duty which they have
to perform. Confidence in battle comes with experience, with leadership, with
comrades and weapons . It is absolutely necessary to inculcate a disciplined fighting
spirit with a realization that a price must be paid for success and the
ingness on the part of the individual officer and soldier to sacrifice himself to
gain the objective . Nen must be taught that every shell and bomb is rot necessaxiJ_•,
directed at them personally, that they all have a good chance to survive regaiv:le3
of the intensity of hostile fire, and that whether or rot they survive ; someone has
to pay a price if success is to be gained. iie must build up the dignity, resour::3-
fulness and responsibility of the noncommissioned officer and junior officer in '
preparation for hi3 duties on the battlefield .
IIf
possible, green troops should be put into a relatively easy fight
the 'first time . Some troops - who are forced to enter a se-rcre b .'ttle for the first
time, and suffer heavy losses, do net seem to recover frori it for a long time or
until practically all of the original men have left -the unit . A man becomes a
good soldier only when he put his duty above his nerson„1 safety . This is something
that can't be taught . On the other hand, strange as it may seem there
comes a time when men become battle weary, and then it is better to have fresh,
vigorous men than to have tired, experienced soldiers . This time comes earlier
with some men than with others depending upon the mans character, but it eventually
comes with s31 of them and must be recognized and watched . If a man has
taken part in many battles and has seen his original squad and platoon mates killed. .
or wounded down to the point where only he and one or t-w-.) others are left, he get_i
a mental complex that it is just a question of time until they will get hi-ra, and
he. begins to think about himself again. At this stage a fresh soldier fulll of
enthusiasm, but with less experience, is much more valuable .
c. Development of Leadership .
ier_rm_wi-11---fo11o_ww a good leade
conditions of battle . Therefore, the placing in position of leadership of the_
ri
men isth-emost° important safeguard for success in battle that a commander
can have . Leadership is a natural gift . . Some men have it to a very high degree,
and others do not have it at all,. We must be ruthless in weeding out and changing
officers and men around so that the leaders are in the positions of leadership,
and the others, regardless of their personal qualifications, are put elsewhere .
Up to the time of battle itself, we are inclined to stress administration, paper
;cork, and tactical knowledge above the flare for leadership . T-n this we are
1:'herever possible before battle we must select the natural leaders, and where the
are weak in administration or in tactical knowledge, take pains to develop them.
We must place the other officers, regardless of how high their qu ali fications are,
,in staff-jobs or in positions where they are not in contact with the men .
After the first battle, the premium on leadership will be placed
higher . by all division commanders than it ever was before . In addition to
selecting the leaders we must also provide the "second and third stringers" as we
s,-:,y in football . I consider this ache most important c~ :.-ty of a division commander,
_- d where time is available, the division commander should not hesitate to investigate
as far. doin as the platoon commanders to see, by personal contact, that the
man has the qualifications to lead his platoon and inspire their confidence and
the willingness to close with the enemy .
In my last battle I lost two regimental commanders, nine battalion
commanders, and forty-three company commanders in the space of twenty days, which
illustrates the need for second and third string replacements to step promptly
into the job and carry on. A well trained and coordinated division and any unit,
for that matter, works on the same principle as a championship football team.
each man must know his job, there must be perfect teamwork, and there must be good ~
substitutes to replace the injured men without weakening the team . There_,- mt be
moo_-faxq_ritis n,_ and . selection_ must
-
,be ruthless . Don't forget that as goes h3
olatoon " so "goes the division .
a ~"`
2
d . Develop Teamwork and Coordinate with All Weapons and arms of Service .
Some of the more important points under this heading are the coordination
of infantry weapons with the artillery . There is a great tendency to let the
artillery do the job . The infantry mortar and assault guns are closer to the front
and subjected to heavy fire, and they often suffer heavy casualties . For this
-
reason there is a tendency to have them remain silent so as not to draw fire,
and let the artillery carry the burden of close in fires as well as the moredistant
fires . This, of course, is wrong as the infantry weapons are designed to
bring close and accurate fire on areas that are difficult to reach by the artillery
and on targets that are difficult to describe for the artillery . The effect of
the artillery fire is thus minimized and not placed on targets -where it should be
and which cannot be reached by the shorter range infantry weapons . The massing o_2
all fires on given areas cr targets is most important .
The successful defense of the Anzio Beachhead can probably be
attributed more to the successful application of massed artillery fires than toany
other cause . This was not true in the early stages of the beachhead but was
a development as time went on . The sudden concentration of a terrific volume of
fire on a target usn-tlly insures a complete annihilation of the enemy at that
point or the complete-neutralization of his effort and is far superior to nibbling
away by one battery or one battalion . The fire of all weapons within range should
be adjusted so that all. can be brought to bear with a maximum volume of fire. We
welcomed news of an enemy counterattack forming, for under the system of massed
fires the enemy was given a terrific punishment .
The coordination of artillery and infantry includes, above all else,
the location of fonrarl observers up vrith front line companies and platoons and
dual means of coln!n nication . We learned not to depend on radio entirely, but
wherever the situation permitted and wire was avail able in the theater, to provide
the artillery observers with both radio and wire co mmunications . Puny times the
radio has been put out of action and the wire cut, but with dual corm unications
there still was maintained the vita]. communications so essential .
The coordinated teamplay between tanks and infantry is very poorly
understood and executed except in armored divisions . It is surprising lo-,,r lir .:le
:_vision and higher commanders understand the proper teamplay between the tanks
..,d the infantry. Training in this vital teamwork has riot been properly stressed
in the States . We gill not win this war with the tank alone, but we will not win
the war without the tank . The enemy uses his tanks with his infantry, and unless I
our infantry has tanks fighting alongside, they - are sure to be ruined by the enemy
tanks . I have seen two enemy tariffs practically annihilate a regiment of American
infantryy in ttr-ma nnutes . _have seen_ty_ oJm .iiidividual t ~ks ~nou dorm=: fro~atlra-
-h ndred to three hundred-of the enemy in a few minutes time . Our battle trained
infantry knows this, but the teamplay between the tanks and the infantry has been
sadly neglected . First of a'1, there must be coaununication between the tank platoons
and the infantry platoons and companies in order that the tank may be directed
to the enemy which is holding up the advance, or that the tank may be informed b;r
the infantry of antitank guns or tank traps which will delay or destroy the tank .
3
Prior to the breakout at the Anzio Beachhead, our G .H .Q. tank battaliot
were put under my command for training for the operation, with the result that for
the first time infantry and tanks acted together as a coordinated team which
resulted in a minimum of losses for the infantry end a mutual regard and admiration
between the infantry and the tanks such as had never existed before . There must be
developed a high degree of cooperation between the tanks, tank destroyers, and
artillery.
Throughout the African and Italian campaigns the German Panther and
Tiger tanks were superior in armament and gunpower to our tanks . It was, therefore
necessary to have tank destroyers right up front with the tanks with their heavier
three inch gun . This was the only gun outside of heavy artillery that could haaj .
the -Panther and Tiger tanks . Had our tanks_been equipped V th a more powerful
there would have been no need for tank destroyers . The tank destroyer simply Mi .
the gunpower that the tank lacked . Therefore, in the attack, the tank and the
tank destroyer must go together with the infantry following close behind to take
advantage of the ground gained .
r
In the defense, tanks and tank destroyers must be scattered over the
front so as to handle the hostile tanks as they attack our positions . Forward
observers from the artillery must ride with the for :.a.-rd line of tanks, and communication
must be set up so as to bring the mass of the artillery fire on objectives
with-speed and accuracy . In general, ordinary artillery fire is not a
great menace to the tank, for unless the tank is hit by heavy calibre artillery, ii ;
will not be seriously damaged . However, massed artillery fires on tanks has prcv :r_
to be successful as a great volume of fire usually results in setting some of the
hostile tanks on fire .
It should be b orne in mind that a small, well drilled, and coordi ::.- t- d
I= can be counted upon to accomplish more than a larger but less coordinated team
hat goes for battles as well as sports . Always take time to coordinate an
attack. Don't all owyourself to bQJturried.
. ..e for your orders to get
down to the lower units_._ _Get all__your men set. It will pay. postattacks that
fai:l_, fa11-"becausethey were not well set, and all the means at the disposal of
the commander were not put into action .
e. kcal:Fitness .
This point is well understood by the American Army and is one of our
best training points . However, we must prepare ourselves according to the job
that we are expected to do and according to our age . The spectacle of a division
commander running across country to get himself in shape is absurd as he will not
be required to withstand physical hardship that requires that kind of endurance .
he may very well injure himself by such exercise . A division commander must
gripaxe him_ sel_f to_go without sleep,, to withstand the -worry and responsibility of
battle, to be calm and fit .
- --
~~
On the other hand, the infantry soldier must be given long practice
arches with full pack, up hill and deign so that he can withstand the f0igue of
carrying a burden, so that he can withstand exposure in cold and wet weather without
getting sick, so that he can go several days without hot food .
4
The tanker must be able to stand the heat of his tank, the foul
atmosphere of his tank, the-jolting and body bruises .
The artilleryman must be' able to fire a1J day and all night with
little sleep and be strong enough to chuck the ammunition in . The ordinary
setting-up exercises are not sufficient . We must prepare our men with hard,
gruelling work.
2 . Speed on the Battlefield. i~_
All movement on the battlefield is relatively slow and deliberate . We
get a false picture of speed in maneuvers because we don't play supply accurately,
we don't have casualties, and we don't take the time for reconnaissance which is
required on the battlefield . In maneuvers we have been guilty of rewarding office .° :
and men for grandstand moves such as would be impossible to make on the battlefield
and which give a false impression of what can be accomplished . Speed can be
made by rapid decisions, by going rapidly from one reconnoitered place to another,
by thinking ahead and being prepared with the solution for emergency when it
arises, and, above all, by forethought as to how to handle the contingencies of
battle when they come up .
A division commander must always be thinking in terms of what is going .to
happen from six to twelve hours ahead of the present . Steady boring in all day
long is what wins the battle . Many tanks were lost in the early days under the
false training idea of boiling dQwn-the-road_inta contact there the _ enemy- a .titank
guns were sitting in a trap and picked our tanks off like ducks . Hundreds
of infantry neni eve-been sacrificed by throwing them into 4ri attack without
ecordinating fire :., without preparation, without reconnoitering the ground . The
irk -rk of a well trained and superior outfit is the delit,arate and assured way it
i;oes into battle, checking on every detail, seeing that everything is set, r dog
;. ^visions for what will probably happen in the immediate future . The nark of a
Loy Scout division is its great industry, its hurry and bluster and lack of
appreciation for and attention to intimate details that go to make up coordination
and assured effort .
An objective in battle is us-i7 fly won in the first fear hours after the
attack begins, or it is not going to i e won at all with the initial combination
Sa?, up. If the attack humps off at daylight and is begged don by ten o'clock in
the morning, the division commander must realize that a change in his plan must
be made . To put such a change into effect and thoroughly lossen up the battlefield
frill require at least six to eight hours, so the new assault can't take
lace much earlier than five or six o'clock in the evening . I have seen many
attempts to hurry this schedule with the result of failure in the ne•~r attempt. .
~ha ncnr change may involve",a greater cone entrat :gin of artillery on a certain
the throwing in of greater force against a front heretofore weakly attacked,
e
If in doubt as to whether you can attack at a certain hour, it is al:,ays
cost to add another hour to insure a better understanding among the 1o .-:er units of
your plan . Always brief your commanders as far down the line and as thoroughly
as time will permit .
The American soldier is fundamentally intelligent and does a lot of
thinking for himself . If he understands the general plan and what you are trying
to do, he will very often contribute very greatly to the success of that plan .
He will surprise you when left to his own devices and in the absence of detailed
orders later in the course of battle . We are generally afraid that the private
grill kn.:)w too much, and if captured, will talk too much about the plan and thus
give it away . I believe this to be over emphasized . If I had time, I would tell
all privates practic ally everything about the plans and would get much better
results thereby .
One of the greatest contributing factors to the successful breai-_throu h
in the Anzio Beachhead was the great amount of detailed planning and the great
amount of briefing that was given to the noncccrsissioned officers and privates in
the tank and infantry units . Reaners'oer that ycu never know when the second, thiri,
and fourth stringers trill step into the shoes of the battalion, company, and platcc_,
commanders . If your attack is to continue smoothly and according to plan, these
men must know .,chat it is all. about, or your attack is bogged down for hours . Iconsider
this one of the most, important things to stress in training and on the
battlefield . I also feel that as a result of our school teachings it is one of
the most overlooked practical ideas .
Give time for briefing . Add plenty of safety factors on all logistics to
:.aye care of the imponderables such as heavy shelling, desttrucrtion of trucks and
bridges enroute, losing the way, etc . It is better to wait for the battle to
begin than to be late arriving in the attack positions .
3 . Coordination Cfmart,,Inrantryy and Arti3ler`,
The tank-infantry-artillery team is little unorstocd outside the armci .--zY'
c'i.-: ?_sions, and this lack of understanding is a distinct; failure of training ix? tt ^- .
It must be corrected at once .
The tank is designed to bear the brunt of battle, and its crew must be
trained to accept the dangers and be :Tilling to lead in the attack wherever the
ground permits . On the other hand, the infantry must not sit back on the hill and
watch the show. Failure of the tanks to take 'she lead and boar. the brunt of
.tle has brought disparaging rev- ~Ks upon th;r by the info--.~7i,rv . Fat lr_re of the
nantry to come up and take over tile ground taLan b;r the to ks has caused the
:a_ks to curse the infantry . Failure of the artillery to n_,ss its fires and help
pave the way by neutralizing tine antitank guns and smothering hostile artillery
has lost many a fight .
In a later paragraph I will discuss t-he d .f '€'teen^.e between G .H.Q. ta''k
'talions and the tank battalion^ o E" the- arm~a>e i divisions - a?id what - I consider to
_- a remedy to change a rather bad situation .
The following is a training directive issued in preparation for the
l,reakthrough at the Anzio Beachhead relative to infantry, tan ., and artillery
cooperation . All assault battalions of infantry and assault battalions of tar-cs
were trained along these lines, and the operation was very successful . It is
:-,I_eved the principles are sound and should be adopted as a basis for all
infantry and tank cooperation .

"There are two general types of action for tanks and infantry : one in
which, due to'the character of the terrain, obstacles or concentrations of antitank
guns in which the infantry makes tho principal attack closely supported by
tanks ; and the other in which, due to the favorable terrain for tanks and where the
enemy's principal defensive lines has been broken, tanks go through to exploit
the success and the action is characterized by the tanks making the main effort
-with the infantry in close support to assist then over obstacles encountered, to
take over the ground gained, and to outpost the tanks for the night . The tank
was developed for the primary purpose of taking the brunt of the battle from the
infantry, to go through areas protected by antipersonnel mines and wire, and small
arms . and machine gun fire .
rer_y weapon available to the enemyJs a-potential
I
killer of the infantry_y soldier; only a fear weapons are _deadly to the tank . The
principal enemies of the tank are unfavorable ground for maneuver, antitank mine :,
antitank guns and artillery . The armor of the tank furnishes reasonably good
protection against artillery fire unless artillery of large caliber makes direct
hits on the tank itself or very close to it, and even in these cases the tank
soldier rarely is injured although his tank mail, be temporarily put out of action .
The_ casualty -rate among tankers is relatively low averaging approximately l-, men per
tank crew, but of these casualties only a small proportion are fatal, a great
majority of the casualties being slight, and tie men are returned to duty in a -
relatively short period of time . The foregoing facts are borne out by statistics
kept over a long period of time and obtained from actual tank encounters . It is,
therefore, reasonable and right to expect the tanker to move boldly out to the
front lead the infantry, and take the brunt of the battle wherever the terrain
permits .
"Artillery observers asst be up fo .7oard with the tok.s and with the
ad~Tanced lines of the infantry to promptly and accurately bring fire on enemy
allations holding up the advance . To much cannot ba stressed on the impox~a-~e :.
the coordination between the artillery, tank and infantrymen . Upon the skkiil
the artillery and the concentrations of its fires depends the success of the
ance, particularly of the tank when held up temporarily by antitank fire .
"Tankers should move forward by bounds covering each other by fire from
tanks in hull down positions in the rear . The advance of tanks may be rapid in.
spots and slow at other times as the tankers must study the ground carefi ,Ly frc-is
one point of advance to another . They must move rapidly from the rear position
to -the selected position fogt-card . Above all, they should have the attitude and
spirit to lead the attack, to continue the advance whether slow or rapid, and
continually bore in to arrive at the final objectives . No other thought should be
in their minds, otherwise they are not good tankers and the expenditure of money
and effort for the manufacture of tanks is wasted .
I.'The.coordination and communication= between the infantry and tanks are
paramount . There must be established radio means of communication so that the
infantry company commander can direct the the tank on to the hostile dispositions
which are holding them up and giving, them casu alties.
7
"Normally in an attack in which the infantry has the main tasks and is
closely supported by tanks, the tanks should be attached directly to the infantry
battalions . In the case where the tanks make the main effort the infantry is
attached to the task commander or moves under orders of the task force . In the
preparation for an attack the tank commander will advise the infantry commander
after careful study of the ground, maps and airplane photographs of the best
manner in which to employ the tanks . The infantry co=mander should accept this
advice and build his attack around the tank wherever possible . Communications
must be thoroughly worked out . This requires in the most cases- special radio
equipment able to coi uituhicate with the tanks to be in the hands of the infantry .
"Special provisions must be made prior to the attack for assisting the
tanks over wadis and other obstacles . This must not be left to chance . If there
are sufficient engineers available, a detachment of engineers may be set up for
this purpose ; if not available, then a part of the pioneer section of the infantry
reconnaissance platoons, or sections of the reconnaissance companies of the armored
regiments, might be used . If neither of the foregoing is ava il able, then the
infantry must act aside one or two squads of men equipped -pith picks and shovels
for this purpose . In an emergency any soldiers nearby the tank that is having -
difficulty must be prepared to come to the assistance of the tank to help it over
the obstacle, as the value of the tank in continuing the advance is well worth the
use of riflemen for this purpose .
"Tanks should habitu sl ly lead the infantry in the attack:' Infantry scouts
may ride on the backs of the tanks as far forward as hostile machine gun and rifle
fire gill permit, and then continue in close proximity to the tanks to point oix ;
to them to-rgets and assist them in getting over bad terrain . The infantry assailii•
should follow the tanks closely as possible so as to promptly take advantage of
the ground gained by the tanks . The distance behind the tanks will depend
principall y on the rule that the infantry . should not follow the tanks so close
as to come under the artillery and other fires which are directed on the line of
tanks . As previously stated, this aistance varies with the terrain, and with the
type and amount of hostile fire being received . If the terrain has been studied
carefully prior to the attack, the tanks -rill know that they can reach a certain
line and then will have to halt and take turret defiladed positions while the
infantry passes through them and establishes a bridgehead on the further side of
the_ obstacle . Artillery, infantry mortars, and the fire from the tanks should
cover the establishment of the bridgehead which:noxmall y should include smoke to
screen the advance and the bridging operations . As soon as the bridgehead is
established or the smoke screen is laid, the tanks should advance promptly and
cross the obstacle . Members of each tank crew should promptly reconnoiter on
foot for the best crossing site and mgrn detailed to assist the the tanks should
begin the preparation of. the crossings . The tanks should cross immediately after
the crossing is prepared and be covered by' the fire of tanks remaining in position ;
all the tanks should get across as soon as possible . Prior to crossing the
obstacle, the tanker should study the terrain and have well in mind where he is
to go upon reaching the other side . After crossing the obstacle, the tanker goes
-through the infantry line and leads the advance until he is again stopped by
unfavorable terrain, minefields or concentrations of antitank weapons . In case
of antitank weapons, artillery fire will be c fled to neutralize them, in case of
minefields, reconnaissance -rill be made to find a passage through or special means
brought up to blow a passage through so that the tank can continue the advance ; in
caso of another obstacle the infantry will have to come up and establish another
bridgehead .
8
"Special provisions should be made by commanders to have infantry or
other troops close behind the tanks to take over prisoners . On many occasions in
the past, large numbers have surrendered to the tankers and have escaped later for
lack of an escort to take them to the rear . While the attack is in progress tanks_
should not be taken from the battlefront to escort prisoners to the rear unless
it is an emergency . Where large groups of prisoners are taken, the tanker may
have to escort them until friendly forces can take them over . Planning should
provide means to take this burden off the tanker and permit him to continue in
the assault .
"The antitank gun is a tremendous asset in the advance of the tanks and
is an absolute necessity where the hostile to ks are superior in numbers or in
armor and armament to our own tanks . It, therefore, will be the practice to
attach tank destroyer units to the assault tank units . The tank destroyer units
will follow the tanks closely from one hull down position to another so as to be
able to cover the advance of the tanks with direct fire . The closest cooperation
and means of communication between the tanks and the tank destroyers is essenti4 .
tiyihen the infantry is attacking without tanks but with tank destroyers, the same
principles apply for the use of the tank destroyers with the infantry .
"It is a fixed rule and a point of honor that neither our tanks or tank
destroyers will permit their infantry to' be overrun by hostile tanks, no matter
what it costs to themselves .
"Upon reaching the objective the tanker and tank destroyer must remain on
the objective until the position is secured and the danger from counterattack by
either infantry or tanks, or a combination of both, has been eliminated . Thereafter
certain tanks and tank destroyers may be required to remain on the objecti : s .
or close thereto while the others may proceed on another mission or go into reser
to refuel and refit .
"Provisions must be made in the employment of both tanks and tank destroyers
for replacing the armored elements in the assault when they have to go to the
rear to replenish their ammunition or gas without the loss of tanks and tank destroyer
support . This is highly important . Reserve platoons of tanks and tank
destroyer elements must be prepared to move to the front Promptly to make the replacement
. The relief must he made so that there will be continuity of armored
support .
"The above principles will be taught to all tankers, tank destroyer
personnel and all infantry. 1--itch has been said about what armor will do in
battle . Let us make good our promise of support . Let the infantry follow us
closely and assist us to get forward and thereby have established between_ the .
: :armor, artillery and infantry that ' utual respect and comradeship on the battle-.
field which is so essential to the success of our cause ."
1, . Observe the Principles of Mass,.
Many attacks during the African and particularly in the Italian campaigns
failed because the principle of mass was not observed . This permitted the enemy
9
r
to move his reserves freely from one part: of the battlefield to another . A good
rule to fo?low is : "If you think you can take an objective with a tooth pick,
use a baseball bat to make sure ." The hissing of artillery fires in particular
was a development of the Anzio Beachhead which had an outstanding' effect on the
successful defense .
Beware of attempting to deceive the enemy by sneaking up on them and .
not employing all your fire power . It is better to come in with all guns blazing .
One of the greatest losses sustained in my own division was in'an action where the
high command decided to do away with the artillery preparation in the false hope -
that the enemy would be surprised . The enemy not only were not surprised but were
waiting for the attack with the result that the infantry suffered severe losses
which would not have occurred had the artillery laid down a curtain of fire to
protect them .
We sailed into Safi harbor in North Africa quietly, waiting for the French
to fire the first shot, whereas how much better it would have been if we could have
come in with all guns blazing, to neutralize the shore
batteries and insta ll ations that were waiting for us and which had been accurately
located.
Throughout the African and Italian campaigns there was a continued demand
to split the armored division and attach part of its troops to another force .
The armored division, like any other division had been developed as a team, and
the full success of its power can only be reaped when it acts as a unit and has
all of its strength available for use . -
5 . Air Support .
There was very little close support by air for ground troops in either
the African or Italian campaigns . In the African can-mai gn the air was mainly used
on strategical missions and on missions for the good of the force as a whole . This
was partially due, at least initially, to the lack of strength in the air at that
time . There is no attempt here to belittle or minimize the wonderful work of the
air in assisting the campaign as a whole, the destruction of the e :iem-y's lines of
communication, supply, etc, Ho>wrever, the close teamwork between the ground and
the air was lacking . Tactical teanm-rork between the air and the ground, particularly
with an armored division, has great possibilities . The air must
receive special training in order to give this essential close cooperation .
In the first place, the air will require intensive training in locating
itself on the ground and in picking . up landmarks and coordinates . Our forces were
repeatedly strafed by our own air by failure of . our _airmen to recognize our own
vehicles end to know where they were at the time . Fortunately, the losses sustained
were relatively light from this cause, but is created a distinct feeling
among the ground forces that our air could not be trusted to wor'!c closely with
ua end in a desire for the air to work- on morn distant targets giving a wider
jar,-:,in of territory between the enemy to be worked on and our own advanced
elements .
10
The lst Armored Division, toward the latter part of the Italian campaign,
carried out an experiment with a fighter-bomber group in an effort to develop
closer cooperation and to obtain close in air support . The work was carried out
with a great deal of enthusiasm by both the air and the armored division and great
progress was made . The principal difficulty was in communications and in
accurately describing to the air the targets to be worked on . Cub planes were
painted yellow on their top wing surfaces and hovered over the hostile targets .
They then described the targets to the incoming fighter-bombers . This worked out
in a highly satisfactory manner after a little experimentation, but the main
difficulty with this system will be that after the enemy has control or partial
control of the air, the Cub plane will not be able to live in the air long enough
to describe the target .
The - greatest single aid to more effective use of armored formations,
particularly in pursuit and where they are moving fast beyond close artillery
support, would be the development of close air support by reconnaissance, strafing,
and bombing . Failure of this air support presents the weakest link in our tactical
team today. Let no one think that this close support can be quickly worked out or
that because a system has been developed with one division that the same system
can be employed with another division without first going through an intensive
training period with both the air and ground people involved . It can be done, an3_
it has been done, and the results are tremendously effective . Although the Air
Service has been apparently reluctant to go into this work in the past, we find
that the air people who are engaged in it and who have worked and overcome the
difficulties of communications with the ground people are most enthusiastic about
the results obtained . This cooperation requires special communication equipment,
special crews to be set up, and intensive training in map reading, orientation,
kn(m ledGc of ground vehicles and weapons, and their principles of operation .
6. The -Fallacy of Attaching Tanks Tank Destroyers, and Antiaircraft
Battalions to Division .
our present system is to attach G .H.Q . tank battalions, tank destroyer
batt ali ons, and antiaircraft battalions to divisions . This has not proven satisfactory,
principall y for the following reasons
First, the team play absolutely essential between these elements and the
infantry and artillery of the divisions to which attached is not developed to the
high degree necessary for successful action . One battalion serves with a division
for a while and then is transferred to another division, sometimes in a short
period of time, and they do not have the opportunity to work out team play .
Second, those small separate battalions are often commanded indifferently, and no
one looks after them to see that they have good leadership ; whereas, if they were
permanently a part of a d vision, the weakness in -leadership v ould be - appare:r_t,
and the division corniander would take necessary action . Third, they are like
orphans in the storm . No one looks after them . They suffer in personnel and
maintenance requirements and are shifted around here and there from one corps to
another or from one division to another with no one having a personal in+to~ •est
in then except the battalion commander himself . The above are very highly practical
considerations although theoreticall y their needs are not so apparent .
11
Panzer Grenadier units of the German Amy all contain organic tank elements
. As long as the tank is so important on the battlefield, our infantry
divisions should have organic tank battalions with them .. The antiaircraft batteries
normally trith divisions are equipped with automatic weapons and are usually
split up to protect the division artillery and the movement of infantry in trucks
and also some of the installations of the division such as headquarters and supply
establishments . These units should also work constantly with the same division
although the requirement is less important since they have a mere passive defensive
role than is true of the tank destroyer and tank battalions .
-
7. The Tank Division vs . G. H . Q. Tank Battalions.
The quality of the G .H.Q. tank battalion in training for battle, aggra.=:-
si_veness, and general all-around efficiency was far below the standard of the tart
battalion in the armored division. There was a continual demand from infantry
divisions to get tank units from the armored divisions attached to them for attacks
that were the normal objectives for G.H .,Q. tank battali ons . The reason given in
all cases was that the tank units of the armored divisions were so much better
trained and has a better fighting spirit and morale than the G .H .Q. tank battalion$
Unfortunately, this attitude was generally correct, and the G .H .Q. tank battali ons .
with notable exceptions, did not do the'work that should be expected of them .
However, there were reasons for this which have been touched upon in the preceding
paragraph .
In the armored divisions, the tank battalions were trained with the
infantry and artillery-of the division as a coordinated team . They had the
benefit of a division commander to look after their leadership, personnel require-
.-melts, supply anti maintenance problems . These items were lacking in the G .H .Q .
tank battalions which were left on their own in practic ally all of the above items .
Several times during the campaigns officers from the 1st Armored Division
were sent over to take command of G .H .Q. tank battalions and replace their commanders
. The effect of this leadership was instantly apparent . Prior to the
breakout in the Anzio Beachhead all of the separate tank battalions in the beachhead
were put under the command of the lst Armored Division for training, supply
maintenance, and administration . This directive ryas enthusiastically received by
the G .H .Q. tank battalions who realized they now had someone who understood their
problems and would help them get what they needed to function .
The above discussion brings up the question of whether there should be
G.H .Q . tank battalions or armored divisions or both and how they should operate .
There should be both . There should be armored divisions 'with a powerful tank
component for breakthroughs, for exploitation, for pursuit, etc . There-should also
be . tank elements as . component parts of P11- infantry divisions . I believe the
solution to the problem is the armored division and the tank battalion as a component
part of the infantry division . Let us not operate as we did prior to this
war, with the infantry developing tanks in one direction and the cavalry in another
and with a development of jealoucy and incompetency in all directions .
12
The British and Germans both employ a heavy tank as the accompanying tank
for infantry. Many arj .unents can be brought in on both sides, but after all is
said, the main thing in a tank is gunpower and maneuverability . By msneuvTerability
I do not mean speed on roads . I mean ability to negotiate terrain and
get over roads and bridges which is just as essential to an infantry accompanying
tank as to any other tank . If the above plan is adhered to it till be seen that
the same type of tank is required whether it closely supports the infantry in
taking limited objectives or whether it is part of an armored division which is
predominantly strong in tanks to smash through defensive lines or to sweep
around the flanks and rear of hostile positions .
8. Tar& vs . Tank Destroyer and Antitank Gun .
The antitank gun is a necessity on the battlefield for the infantry .
It should be a towed weapon reasonably easy to Manhandle, with a high muzzle
velocity.
There is no need for tank destroyers . I believe the whole organization
development of the tank destroyer will be considered a great mistake of the vrar .
In the first place, the doctrine orginally promulgated, of the tank destroyer
seeking out and pursuing the tank was a fall y which caused the destruction of
many lives and much equipment before it was corrected . The tank destroyer M-10,
now in use, has proven of great benefit simply because it contained a 3 inch
gun that was the best gun for coping with the Tiger and Panther German tanks .
Had this gun or a more powerful gun been installed in a tank, there would have
been no need for the tank destroyer .
The 37 TD mounted on a 3/4 ton chassis and a 75 gun mounted on a half
track as tank destroyer weapons were absurd and could not possibly take the place
even of the Grant tank with a 75 gun . The most effective use for tank destroyers
was found to be to split them up into platoons and attach them to tank companies
and tank- battal ions to furnish the e _tra--gunpower required when the superior Gerrna' :
tank eras met on the battlefield . The German, up to now, has had superiority in
tanks and tank gunpower in his Tiger and Panther tanks with their high velocity
88 and 76 calibre guns . Our 3 inch gun in the tank destroyer and our heavy
artillery were the only antidctes although our %i-4 medium tack was a much superior
tank except for its gun and axmor.
The Germans have self-propelled guns on the same principle as our selfpropelled
artillery in the armored divisions except that they went to higher calibres
than the 105 . They used these guns as roving guns on the battlefield and as
such they were highly successful, but no more so than our ownn self-propelled guns
accept as to the weight of the artillery piece involved . The foreign armies have
always been. ahead of us in the development of high velocity pieces of ordnance, and
for the last two years our troops have been continually outgunned by German pieces
of ordnance . When the day comes that we equip our tanks with a high velocity and
heavy calibre gun, there will be no need for tank destroyers as such, and they
should be eliminated along with their overhead, etc . The artillery of the Army
should develop both self-propelled and towed equipment as both have their use on
the battlefield, and both have proven their worth beyond discussion .
13
Repace63-ntsandReplaccanent Training.
The replacement situation was not very satisfactory in the African and
Italian campaigns . During the African campaign the 2d Armored Division was used
in large part to furnish replacements to keep the 1st Armored Division in battle .
Although some 19,000 highly trained armored force replacements arrived in Africa,
these men were used to create new service units and were lost for their original
purpose.
After the Mount Portia fight in Italy, the 6th Infantry of the 1st Arreorer
Division lost heavily and had to fill its ranks with truck drivers,_ tank destroyer
and tank personnel due to lack of infantry replacements .
In general, the replacements are not suited by training to take over the r
duties in combat . Unfortunately, the replacements received often had to go into
the fight immediately and had no opportunity to be trained in their combat duties .
Replacements of both officers and men came to the theater with higher rank than
they were able to hold due ~,o lack of experience and training in the unit to which
sent . As a result, many of the officer replacements could not be used and had to
be carried as surplus . This blocked the promotion cf deserving men . A great
many of the enlisted replacements had to, be reduced in grade as they were incapable
of holding down the job to which they had been promoted .. Many of the enlisted -men
asked to be reduced after they themselves realized that they were incompetent .
There would have been a far more efficient ystem if enlisted replacements were
generally confined to basic privates and the officers here Second Lieutenants,
thereby allowing the unit to promote its deserving and experienced men to fill tha
higher vacancies . It would then have been possible to fill in at the bottom wits
fresh men from the States . There would be exceptions to this rule as o;;cca-sion'al,
high ranking officers became casualties, and no suitable replacements were available
in the unit . However, in most cases there were suitable men to fill their
places within the- unit, and if not within the unit it-oe1f, officers from adjacent
divisions could be found to transfer over and become promoted thereby . These men
had the battle experience necessary to carry on in an efficient manner while the
battle was still in progress .
A general impression was gained that replacements from the States were
not given sufficient intensive combat -training but instead were trained generally
to -fill various specialists' ratings and that their training covered a broad field
rather than having the fundamentals for combat stressed . There was small call for
clerks and administrative personnel as this type did not suffer the heavy casualties
. On the other hand, there was a great deniand for the private soldier ad the
junior officer to fill the depleted ranks of the front line combat platoons and
companies .
As a constructive criticism I believe less time should be given to the
training in current events and all of the various items that have to be included
on the man's service records as having been accomplished such as seeing a certain
course of movies or listening to a certain course of lectures or having been
psychoanalyzed . More time could then be spent on the fundamental drill and training
to fit the man for combat work in the front line .
1 4
As soon as replacements arrived they were immediately given intensive
training in these fundamental combat duties which were so evidently lacking .
However, as stated above, it was the unfortunate rule rather than the exception
that, the men arrived and were, within twenty-four hours, put into the battle line .
They had to learn in the hardest way without having been given sufficient opportunity
for training . This situation was particularly true during a long sustained
drive where it was essential that the units be kept up to strength in order to
continue the attack .
10 . Infantry.
The infantry in this war, as in all other wars-, has the heaviest casualties
. However, their casualties would have been less had they been more soundl :-
trained in the fundamentals and to operate more closely and efficiently with tanks
and artillery. I believe it to be a fallacy to ca"11 the infantry "the queen of
battles" because on the modern battlefield there is no king or queen, nor is any
branch of service more important than another . They all have equal importance if
the team is worked up properly.
3
Our infantry soldier eras given the lowest classification as to intelligence,
which is a:riistake as it takes an in_t elli_&e1_ _man to be_ a good infantry
solda.er. --The principal points which need to be stressed in infantry training are
the fundamentals such as perfection of crew drill, the use of their weapons, and
the fundamental formations to make maximum use of cover, terrain, and dispersion
as they advance under fire .
Relative to tack-infantry cooperation, if the assault is on a definite
single objective, the infantry should be in position to att;:".k before the .tanks
arrive whenever practicable. Oftentime the infantry in position can observe
elements in the situation which were not known or considered in the planning for
the attack .
Assault guns were used as infantry direct fire support weapons on several
occasions where the tanks had by-passed enemy strong points . The enemy infantry
at these strong points engaged our infantry but were soon dispersed by direct fire
assault gun_ support .
A good football team uses about eight to ten plays during a season,
these plays are fully developed, and every man thoroughly understands them . He
is drilled for hours in the fundamentals . A mediocre football team often has
thirty to forty plays none of which are successful as no play is fully understood
nor are the men thoroughly drilled day after day in the fundamentals . Good
infantry is the same as a good_ .football team and must concentratc__o :z_a few forma-
_tions and drill constantly -to perfect themselves . The following are some constructive
criticisms that have been made during the training of the 6th Infantry
prior to combat and are well worth considering in our preliminary battle training
in the States :
"There was a considerable lack of dispersion which is a common fault and
must be continu all y worked upon in order to overcome this natural human instinct
to herd . This fault was particularly noticable when passing over bad ground or
15
through hoods on the part of the assault elements and was a common fault in the
approach of the reserve elements under all types of terrain . We must remember that
the assault elements are the ones that get in close in rifle and machine gun fire
to the r:axi.mum, and the reserve elements are the targets for the mortars and the
artillery fire . Our artillery continually attempts to separate the reserves and
the supply of ammunitions, etc ., from reaching the front line elements by destructive
fires placed upon them . Usually the front line elements are in such
close contact that neither the hostile or friendly artillery can fire on them_ .
_
;re must not be careless in the approach of reserves . They must-come up with the
greatest dispersion possible with effective control . They must use all cover
available in the approach march or they will be pinned down by artillery and mortar.
fire and if not destroyed will be unable to support their front line elements wh ::nn
needed .
"There was a general lack of maneuver to overcome machine gun and other l
obstacles holding up the advance . The general tendency was to stop and call for / , '-
artillery fire on every occasion when stopped by machine guns . It must be realize,! TI//
.hat artillery may not be able to properly reach the target or may be having
'
priority calls on other missions such that it cannot fire on the target desired .-
The infantry must be alert to take advantage of the iL,urd and while covering the
hostile machine guns by their own fire, maneuver fl :?(aking .forces to overcome the
obstacles from the flank or rear.
1

"There was a general tendency on the part of the infantry t.o--dtepoened
much on 'the artillery and not employ the many excellent close in weapons under heirdi,ii control such as machine guns, mortars, and assault, guns . The artillery
has the range necessary to stop the forward movement of hos' ;ile reserves and tie
power to destroy hostile tan'-,s and antitank guns . Those _rgets cannot be
efficiently taken under fire by the smnl.ler weapons a.aila la to the infantry . On
?;;ie other hand, the infantry weapons when . properly used ca:- handle many of the
obstacles that are holding them up on the front fringe of the attack at close rarg
Every effort must be made by battalion and company commanders to get all of their
means . into action . .
"In capturing ground from the German it is axiomatic that he will i .vnediat '
ly counterattack J th -whatever he has at his disposal. This counterattack may be
anything from a few men on up . Our troops upon arriving on a captured objective
are more or less disorganized, and do not promptly organize themselves to most the
inevitable counterattack . This reorganization must be done on each platoon,
company and battalion front at once . The reorganization includes the digging in
oy personnel, the proper sighting of machine guns and other weapons, and the
romp, registration by the mortars and artille--y on the likely avenues of approach
the counterattacking forces . The men of th-3 6th Infantry remember well that
every objective they took in the ":_reuse trap" during Tunisian' campaign -t,;-as invariably
followed by the counterattacks . To the credit of the regiment and also to
.he prompt action of the Division artillery in support, these counterattacks were
,rich one or two exceptions promptly beaten back . Let us not forget this valuable
~r_perience and not fail to impress our new men with action required . Reme ..ber
that we are having a considerable daily turnover of officers and men due to casuaal-
.ies, and these new people must be continually worked upon to thoroughly learn the
16
le3son3 which the older people can teach them and which have been learned the hard
way with so much cost in lives and blood .
"Flank protection is paramount . In some cases during attacks the flank
protection did not go out far enough . The mission of the flank protecting groups
is to prevent surprise and to provide delay until elements from the main body can -
arrive and repel the throat . This means that the flank detachments have got to
go out far enough on the flanks where they . can see the approach of the enemy and
to terrain that they can hold until help arrives ." (1st Armored Division Training
Directive) .
Training must be continuous as units engaged in battle have an immense
tut-nover. This point will be brought home more clearly when it is realized for
example that in the past two years the lst Armored Division alone has had approximately
.34,000 battle and nonbattle casualties although its original strength was
approximately 13,000 . This illustrates the -immense turnover and change in personnel
. A division that is on the firing line is always more or less a new division,
and after a heavy campaign its battle efficiency is probably not as good as a
division in the States with all of its original trainad men present, except from
the standpoint of battle experience in the surviving members of the combat division .
11. Tanks
The war has proven the soundness of the principles taught by the Ainore :i!
Force, and although many people were skeptical about the use of tanks, the tank ha-;
already proven itself a necessity and a bulwark on the battlefield, and in days
to come its importance will be increased with better opera',-rig terrain avail abla ._
Unfortunately, in the Italian c;..,:paign the terrain rind climate were such
n to restrict the use of tanks tremendousiy, but even in th-.a t campaign it was ':he
taa(c that made the breakthrough out of the Anzio Beachhead . It was the tank that
assisted the advance of the infantry and the advance to join the southern force
with the beachhead forces . Again it was the tank that bore the brunt of the push
from Rome to the Arno River. The tank, however, is not an instrmient alone. It -
must be closely supported by infantry and artillery . The tank was designed to take t
brunt of battle from the infantry . Our tankers can be trained with the offen_si-re
spirit to lead. the infantry in the attack . if the tnk does not do this, it has
not justified its existence . It's a well known statistical fact that although
losses may be heavy in tanks, the losses to the personnel of tanks is relatively
light, averaging about one and a fraction man per crew, and of these losses only
a small part are fatal. Our tankers have learned to be alert, to observe carefully
the foreground, and to go from one de£il .•ded position to another with speed
and assurance . Tankers need not bo afraid of ±ille :~f fir and develop confi;'
Zence in passing through heavy concentration • of a~ til7 .er,;- after - they receive
negligible losses therefrom .
Tanks can operate in much rougher country than was formerly thought
?ossible . Field Iiarshal von Kesselring, the German Commander in Italy, paid a
greet tribute to our tanks w'icn he stated that ffmerican tanLrs went through country
thoug t impossible for tank operation an, which had not, therefore, been properly
17
defended against them. He also stated that our tank-infantry-artillery teamwork
in breaking out of the beachhead was a flawless example of attention to every
detail .
The greatest. single_. attribute of a tanker is to shoot accurately and _
with speed. The next is the spirit to continu all y bore in; however, roan doll
and-with hi$--eyes-wide-_ open _to : observe every possible point S •.he-e the enemy-,could
be concealed . All suspicious points should be shot at, and although the tanker may
iiot -'see'any enemy, the spraying of the ground in front with machine gun fire and
the sending of a round of 75 ammunition into every suspicious bush, outhouse,
haystack, or other point of natural cover upsets the defenders who do not know
whether they have been located or not but who consider that they have been since
fire is coming in their direction .
The tanks can make a path through hostile wire and antipersonnal mine
fields through which the infantry can pass without casualty . The infantry, on the
other hand, can spot antitank guns and concealed enemy tanks and thus greatly assist
the tanker.
In the pursuit north of Rome it was practice to carry infantry on the
backs of the tanks, and when the tanks came to turns in the mountain roads, the
infantry would dismount and reconnoiter around the turn to discover the presence
of antitank guns or hostile tanks . Many tanks and guns were thus discovered, saving
our own tanks from ambush and permitting a concerted plan of attack to remove the
resistance and allow the column to proceed .
Our light tank' was used to great advantage in ncviir :; with the infantry
forward line to assist them i:l mopping hcs"-• =i_e resistance tin __.ch had been passed
over by the heavier leading tanks .
The maneuverability of our tanks can be greatly enhanced by wider tracks .
Increased maneuverability of tanks across country at the expense of speed is
highly desirable, and above all, our tanks should carry the highest velocity and
heaviest gun that can be carried consistent with other considerations, such as
weight" and power . Armor should be sacrificed for gunpower and maneuverability on
every occasion . Tanks must be withdrawn from the line after two or three days of
continuous fighting but can be put into battle again after a short rest of twenityfour
to forty-eight hours .
he task crew fights all day and spends a lar •7e part of the night on
maintenance and suppi'T of' -soline and ammunition Consequently, they get little
rest . The service of the crew in the tank is i:_ost fati;;uing due to the foul air,
heavy jolting, and hammering .
A high explosive shell
.i.r
t.'_ :-: h.,st type of x ti_? _ tt -y fire to be used in
front of tanks . This type of `'ire enables the ta-i:_ commander to keep his
aead out of the turret, thereby giving she tank about fif y percent more efficiency
than it would have if the tan were :oapletely buttoned up . Our tankers in the
rmored Division insist on the tark co-:Traeder ka ening his hF:-d out of the turret and
won't serve under a commander who han't ' ::e co'--'age t- do t•::.:_s . However, the
sermans know this, and we lost quite a few tank con-~manc_ers by sniping fire . Time
18
fire by the artillery can be placed directly on top of the tank formation when the
tanks arc buttoned up but has the disadvantage that the tank is blind and is only
about twenty-five percent efficient .
Artillery fire can be placed within fifty yards of the tanks without any
undue damage . This requires careful adjustment of fire by the artillery and
perfect coordination and te ,m-rork .
The three great enemies of the tank are terrain, which restricts their
maneuverability, the antitank gun, which can. be concealed and destroy the tank
at close range, and the mine, which can disable the tank termporarily . The
ordinary. mine usually blows the track which can be replaced very quickly . However,
it must be remembered that a tank once it hits a mine will never operate with the
same mechanical efficiency again because, although the track and bogies may be
replaced, certain stresses and strains are set up in the driving mechanism due to
the sudden stopping of the machinery. A tank that has hit a mine never operates
at more than seventy-five to eighty percent of its original mechanical efficiency .
12. Mines .
The extensive use of mines, both antitank and antipersonnel, by the German
is one of the greatest menaces of the present war . No area, either forward or
back, is aafe from the mine. The most effective enemy mining tras the sporadic
mining of long stretches of road, road shoulders, craters, and areas upon withdrawal.
Heavily mined fords strewn with metal fragments to render detectors useless
were also effective delays . In general, the enemy's mine technique and mine
equipment were superior to our own .
During the later phases of the African campaign and throughout the Italian
campaign the Germans employed a box mine made of wood and having practical) y no
metal which made it almost impossible to`detect with a mine detector. Also, there
was introduced the shoe mine which was a sm ll wooden box hidden in the grass or
under the leaves and used as an antipersonnel mine .
Late in the Italian campaign a new type of antipersonnel mine appeared
made entirely of plastic except for the detonating device . The Gcrnans stre^fred theft
freely along the ditches and roadways . The German positions around the Anzio
Beachhead were thoroughly covered with nine fields . They presented a great problem
to the passage of tanks, a problem which was not solved . A large proportion
of the heavy losses of tanks in the breakthrough at Anzio were caused by going
through these i 'ne fields . The antitank mine has no sure antidote except the slow,
painful process of picking up the mines by detectors or by charging through the
rdne fields at great loss to vehicles .
The "snake" was successfn nll y used in the breakthrough at Anzio and has
eossibilities whore the 2L.ne field can be located dead of time and where conditions
are favorable for approaching with a tank to push the "snake" through the field.
Several lanes were blown through mine fields with a great demoralizing effect on
the energy . However, the danger with the "snake" is its susceptibility to being
set off by artillery and causing heavy casualties by our own troops in the immediate
vicinity .
19
There was also developed a primer cord which was shot out of an infantry
mortar and when detonated, cleared a path about 20 inches wide through the grass
exploding the antipersonnel mines .
Tanks are impervious to the antipersonnel mine and can go through wire
entanglements, which are usually strung with antipersonnel mines, clearing a way
for the infantry. However, the solution to the problem of locating mines and mine
fields is yet to be found .
Intensive mine training must be given to every officer and man, regardless
of his duties. This should include detection, disarming, where Lines are mostly
likely to be found, etc . Our own mines proved to be a great menace . P-tany local
operations were conducted during the siege of the beachhead such as raids on en , ~ r
strong points, etc ., and in almost every case we had as much damage done by our
own mines as we did by hostile mines . The sectors were occupied by different
divisions, each one putting in more mines, and a careful . record was not kept, as
it should have been, as to location of the mines installed . Troops frequently
place mines in front of their positions at night as a protection and go off foregetting
to raise them or mark them properly . The result is heavy casualties to ,
other troops which pass over the same ground later . Much more drastic discipline
and training in the handling of mines and the use of mines by our own people has
got to be employed .
13 . Miscellaneous .
One of the most important items of equipment is the armored bulldozer .
It played an important part in the pursuit of the Germans in Italy . Without it
we couldn't have advanced as all bridges and culverts were blown, and house .
were often blown into the streets . A greater proportion of armored bulldozers
should be set up.
In the early days of the war we dissipated a great many 50 calibre
machine guns and also 30 calibre machine guns by placing them on peeps, trucks,
and vehicles for antiaircraft defense . This has been partially rectified but we
still are wasting too many machine guns for this purpose . It is absolutely unnecessary
to install machine puns on peeps and indiJidna1 passenger vehicles . 30
calibre machine guns are practicall y useless against air, and it is a grave question`
whether men will remain in their vehicles and fire any type of machine gun against
a low flying hostile airplane.
I
The 37 millimeter gun is another weapon that has been built in large
quantities and which has no practical use accept in small quantities in the
infantry to operate against machine gun nests .
In pursuit in rough country, column comet riders must be well forward .
'-there only the first few leading tanks are engaged, a column commander should have,
:is tank not more than six vehicles from the front, and the infantry commander I
should be right with him .
The Cub airplane has proven to be one of the greatest assets for artillery
fire and, contrary to expectation, has been able to survive on the battlefield
in spite of hostile aii .
20
For liaison communications between infantry-tank-tank destroyer teams it
is essential that a sufficient number of radio sets SCR-300 be available to permit
distribution down to and including infantry companies, tank platoons, and tank
destroyer gun sections .
All artillery should receive training in direct fire over the sights in
addition to their normal indirect fire training . All tanks and tank destroyers
should receive indirect fire training for use as artillery in addition to their
normal direct fire training and should be equipped with the necessary sighting
apparatus for indirect fire .
During a pursuit the use of reconnaissance dements, as the leading
element in a force, merely because contact has been lost locally, is not justified
in most circumstances . Where the nature of the expected next resistence can be n
any way deduced - and it usually can - appropriate composition of the column
should be made ahead of time to overcome it ; usually time is saved in the long
run if medium tanks lead . If demolitions, only lightly defended, are to be
expected, light tanks in front work well . Putting a reconnaissance element in
front is advisable only when it can be used deployed ; in a situation wherein
nothing more serious than undefended demolitions are expected or where a route
reconnaissance appropriate to armored reconnaissance is expected to be the first
operational problem to be met . In pursuit situations, liaison missions are so
frequent that there is ample work for available reconnaissance without seeking
opportunities for its employment otherwise . In a pursuit the three most habitual
and most profitable uses of the armored reconnaissance platoon hate been :
a . Contact patrols to contact flank units .
b. Flank observation posts .
c . Reconnaissance of alternate routes parallel to axis of advance .
Motorcycles again proved their worth in the last operation . Because of
the ability of the cyclist to get through heavy traffic quickly, the carrying of
written communications was greatly expedited . Because of the single axis of
communication available to the battalion throughout the operation, traffic was
always congested, and during one phase, it tool: a motorcycle fifteen minutes to
deliver an important message over a route that took a "peep" one hour and twenty
minutes to travel .
Recent actions involving much combat reconnaissance have revealed the
necessity for the following modifications in the Armored Car M-8 :
a. . Added protection on the floor to protect the cre :•r from mines ;
signing the floor to permit heavy sandbagging would be of some value .
b . Better protection for the radiator. A regimental reconnaissance
company had twelve (12) cars knocked out of action due to shell fragments through
he radistors during a period of less than one month .
c . Add a .30 Cal i•:G bow-gun to be operated by the assistant driver .
21
The hatches for the driver and assistant driver on light tanks should be
redesigned to permit unrestricted movement of the gun when hatches are open . On
many occasions the gun is fired when it is not advisable for the tank to button up .
In operations in mountainous or otherwise difficult terrain, the M-4
tank dozer proved to be the most valuable vehicle in the entire force . It is
capable of working under artillery fire and the speed with which these vehicles
were able to repair obstacles was not approached by any other method . They were
kept well forward in the column at all times as they could rapidly reach the head
of the column when needed .
Present camouflage nets are very inflammable . Many have - been set on fire
by - shells or bombs causing great vehicular damage and loss . The garnishing
material is not dyed fast and must be replaced in a few months .
When TDs are firing in artillery roles, it is highly desirable to have
a large size fire extinguisher placed in a hole to rear of Zi-lO .
Sights, both direct and panoramic, should be equipped with night lighting
devices . Makeshift lighting devices are not satisfactory . In direct fire at
night, hits simply will not be obtained -without such devices .
At the present time all members of the armored car crew in reconnaissance
elements are aimed with the carbine . It has been found that an automatic weapon
similar to the Thompson Sub-'Machine Gun must be the ann of one of the occupants cf
the turret of the armored car particularly when operating in close areas infested
with enemy infantry. The enemy -will watch the traverse of the turret and move
towards the armored car when the turret guns are not pointed directly at them .
This automatic weapon provides necessarily rapid close in fire against these
individuals who attempt to disable the vehicle by approaching from blind spots .
The "Bazooka" would be more effective if the ammunition was more sensitir^
to detonation . Its effect on houses and fortified strong points would be doubled
if it did not take much a direct hard blow against a very solid substance to
detonate it .
The packing of mortar ammunition should be improved . A wood chest, 3
rds per chest, with a handle for carrying, is suggested .
Combined infantry-tank trainina cannot be stressed too much, Recent
intensive trai ning of the armor of this division with infantry elements of another/
division proved to be of great value . This was shown by closer cooperation,
better understanding of cs.pabilities and limitations of troops, weapons of other
units . However, it is felt that while close support of tanks, medics, or light, is~
desirable, it was found not to be always practicable . In most instances it has
moved for:rard faster than foot troops can advance . By lingering and waiting for
infantry to mop up, the tanks e;---pose themselves unduly, and if the tanks continue
on, enemy infantry krill rise up and a regular infantry battle ensues, thereby
breaking up the tank-infantry team play. This situation u as remedied by using
medium tanks for the assault punch and attaching light tanks to the infantry to
22
assist in mopping up operations . It is believed that semi-permanent tank-infantry
teams, trained together and used together whenever possible in combat will alone
insure the accomplishment of a tough mission .
More training must be devoted to the meaning and requirements of one's
combat mi ssions . This will require cor~anders of all echelons to be more careful
and concise in the assignment of the mission, to question the subordinate commander
carefully to avoid all possible misunderstanding of the mission . It will also
require the subordinate commander to devote :sore care to the complete understanding
of his mi ssion . Then, he must be allowed fell independence of action within the
scope of his mission. With the full knowledge of what is to be required of him,
the subordinate trill be able to conduct himself and his command more irate ligenUir,
with the long term requirement in view . it will also render the constant repetition
of orders, which are dependent on perfect radio communication (often
lacki-nig), much less necessary .
More emphasis must be placed on training of combat and reconnaissance
patrols . Use of pie scribed routes, resorts of where, when and what, and the
necessity for the accomplishment of the mission cannot be too strongly impressed
on combat personnel .
As this has been a discussion mainly on training, details as to recommendations
on changes in equipment and tables of organization, particularly as
pertain to an Armored Division, will be covered separately .
