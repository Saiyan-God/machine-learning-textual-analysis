WAR DEPARTMENT '
WASHINGTON May 22 94
FM 00-5 Field Service Regulations Operations is published
for the information and guidance of all concerned
It contains the doctrines of leading troops in combat and
tactics of the combined arms and constitutes the basis of
instruction of all arms and services for field service Additional
doctrines pertaining to the defense of coast lines and
landing operations on hostile shores are discussed in other
manuals
Field Service Regulations will be interpreted in the light of
FM 27- 0 Rules of Land Warfare FM 04-5 Field Service
Regulations Operations should be studied in connection with
FM 00- 0 Field Service Regulations Administration and
FM 00- 5 Field Service Regulations Larger Units
While the fundamental doctrines of combat operations are
neither numerous nor complex their application is sometimes
difficult Knowledge of these doctrines and experience in their
application provide all commanders a firm basis for action in
a particular situation This knowledge and experience enable
the commander to utilize the flexible organization with which
he is provided to group his forces into task units most suitable
for the accomplishment of his mission
Set rules and methods must be avoided They limit imagination
and initiative which are so important in the successful
prosecution of war They provide the enemy a fixed pattern
of operations which he can more easily counter
It is a function of command to coordinate the tactics and
technique of the various arms and services so as to develop
in the forces employed on a given task the teamwork essential
to success

CHAPTER 4
THE EXERCISE OF COMMAND
DOCTRINES OF COMBAT
The ultimate objective of all military operations is
the destruction of the enemy's armed forces in battle The
ability to select objectives whose attainment contributes most
decisively and quickly to the defeat of the hostile armed farces
is one attribute of the able commander
• 3 Simple and direct plans and methods with prompt and
thorough execution are often decisive in the attainment of
success
• 4 Unity of command obtains that unity of effort which
is essential to the decisive application of full combat power
of the available forces Unity of effort is furthered by full
cooperation between elements of the command
s 5 Through offensive action a commander exercises his
initiative preserves his freedom of action and imposes his
will on the enemy A defensive attitude may however be
deliberately adopted as a temporary expedient while awaiting
an opportunity for counteroffensive action or for the purpose
of economizing forces on a front where a decision is not
sought The selection by the commander of the right time
and place for offensive action is a decisive factor in the success
of the operation
Numerical inferiority does not necessarily commit a command
to a defensive attitude Superior hostile numbers may
be overcome through greater mobility better armament and
equipment more effective fire higher morale and better
leadership Superior leadership often enables a numerically
inferior force to be stronger at the point of decisive action
A strategically defensive mission is frequently mast effectively
executed through offensive action It is often necessary
for an inferior force to strike at an early moment in
order to secure initial advantages or to prevent itself from
being overwhelmed by a growing superiority in the hostile
forces
22
OPERATIONS
6- 9
• 6 Concentration of superior forces both on the ground
and in the air at the decisive place and time and their employment
in a decisive direction creates the conditions
essential to victory Such concentration requires strict economy
in the strength of forces assigned to secondary missions
Detachments during combat are justifiable only when
the execution of tasks assigned them contributes directly
to success in the main battle
7 Surprise must be sought throughout the action by
every means and by every echelon of command It may be
obtained by fire as well as by movement Surprise is produced
through measures which either deny information to
the enemy or positively deceive him as to our dispositions
movements and plans Terrain which appears to impose
great difficulties on operations may often be utilized to gain
surprise Surprise is furthered by variation in the means
and methods employed in combat and by rapidity of
execution
Surprise often compensates for numerical inferiority of
force
Surprise finds the enemy in a state of mental moral or
physical unpreparedness Every effort should be made to
deny him time to take effective countermeasures The effect
of surprise may be lost through dilatory methods of execution
• 8 To guard against surprise requires a correct estimate
of enemy capabilities adequate security measures effective
reconnaissance and readiness for action of all units Every
unit takes the necessary measures for its own local ground
and air security Provision for the security of flanks and
rear is of especial importance
COMMAND
• 9 Command is the authority which an individual in the
military service lawfully exercises over subordinates by virtue
of rank or assignment
Command and leadership are inseparable Whether the
force is large or small whether the functions of command are
complex or simple the commander must be the controlling
head; his must be the master mind and from him must flow
the energy and the impulse which are to animate all under
him
23
20- 24
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
20 Decision as to a specific course of action is the responsibility
of the commander alone While he may accept advice
and suggestions from any of his subordinates he alone
is responsible for what his unit does or fails to do
∎ 2 A willingness to accept responsibility is the foremost
trait of leadership Every individual from the highest commander
to the lowest private must always remember that inaction
and neglect of opportunities will warrant more severe
censure than an error of judgment in the action taken /The
criterion by which a commander judges the soundness of his
own decision is whether it will further the intentions of the
higher commander / Willingness to accept responsibility must
not manifest itself in a disregard of orders on the basis of a
mere probability of having a better knowledge of the situation
than the higher commander The subordinate unit is a part
of a tactical team employed by the higher commander to
accomplish a certain mission and any independence on the
part of a subordinate commander must conform to the general
plan for the unit as a whole
22 The commander's mission is contained in the orders
which he has received Nevertheless a commander of a
subordinate unit cannot plead absence of orders or the nonreceipt
of orders as an excuse for inactivity in a situation
where action on his part is essential or where a change in
the situation upon which the issued orders were based renders
such orders impracticable or impossible of execution If the
situation does not permit communication with the superior
commander and the subordinate commander is familiar with
the general plan of operations or the mission of the whole
command he should take appropriate action and report the
situation as early as practicable
23 The situations that confront a commander in war are
of infinite variety In spite off the most careful planning and
anticipation unexpected obstacles frictions and mistakes are
common occurrences in battle A commander must school
himself to regard these events as cgmmonplace and not permit
them to frustrate him in the accomplishment of his mission
∎ 24 Personal conferences between the higher commander
and his subordinates who are to execute his orders may at
times be advisable that the latter may arrive at a correct
24
I
OPERATIONS
24- 28
understanding of the-plans and intentions of their superior
Commanders do not justify their decisions to subordinates
nor do they seek the approval of subordinates for their
actions
• 25 All the troops assigned to the execution of a distinct
mission should be placed under one command to function as
a task force for the duration of the operation So long as a
commander can exercise effective command he does not disturb
the established chain of command in his force In some
situations conditions dictate that attachments must be made
to subordinate commands Such attachments may be necessary
in marches during periods of development in rapidly
changing situations or in the later stages of any action and
in general when better support or coordination can be
effected
• 26 A commander who is advanced to a higher command
should be relieved from the responsibility of direct command
of his former unit
ESTIMATE Of THE SITUATION
• 27 In any tactical operation the commander must
quickly evaluate all the available information bearing on his
task estimate the situation and reach a decision
• 28 The commander's estimate of the situation is based on
the mission of the unit the means available to him and to the
enemy the conditions in his area of operations including
terrain and weather and the probable effects of various lines
of action on future operations (See FM 0 -5 ) On the basis
of these factors he considers the lines of action open to him
which if successful will accomplish his mission and the
lines of action of which the enemy is physically capable and
which can interfere with such accomplishment He analyzes
the opposing lines of action one against another to arrive at
conclusions as to the probability of success for each of his
own lines of action On the basis of this analysis he then considers
the relative advantages and disadvantages of his own
lines of action and selects that line of action which most
promises success regardless of what the enemy may do If
two or more lines of action appear equally promising he
chooses that one which will most favor future action
25
29- 33
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
• 29 The estimate often requires rapid thinking with consideration
limited to essential factors In campaign exact
conclusions concerning the enemy can seldom be drawn
To delay action in an emergency because of insufficient information
shows a lack of energetic leadership and may
result in lost opportunities The commander must take
calculated risks
• 30 In considering the enemy's possible lines of action
the commander must guard against the unwarranted belief
that he has discovered the enemy's intentions and against
ignoring other lines of action open to the enemy Even when
the weight of evidence warrants the belief that the enemy
is committed to a definite line of action the commander
must bear in mind that a change in the enemy's plans may
occur at any time
• 3 Because of their great mobility and rapid striking
power the capabilities of the opposing air and armored
forces and the possible effect of their employment must be
continually evaluated In estimating the capabilities of air
armored and motorized forces both friendly and hostile
the commander must be provided with full and up-to-date
information on the existing and probable future weather
conditions and their effect both ground and air on employment
of such forces
• 32 The estimate of the situation culminates in the decision
A decision once made Is not changed without some
compelling reason In combat the will and energy of the
commander must persist until the mission is accomplished
Estimation of the situation is however a continuous process
and changed conditions may at any time call for a new
decision Too stubborn an adherence to a previous decision
may result in costly delay loss of opportunity for decisive
action or outright failure
TERRAIN
• 33 That part of the commander's estimate dealing with
terrain often exercises a decisive influence upon his decision
and plan Proper evaluation and utilization of the terrain
reduce the disadvantage of incomplete information of the
enemy The more important features to be considered in
evaluating terrain include not only natural ground forms
such as mountains ridges streams bodies of water woods
26
OPERATIONS
33- 36
and open spaces but also artificial features such as roads
railroads and towns The commander seeks always to
utilize the terrain to his own advantage and to the enemy's
disadvantage
• 34 While the mission of a force is the basic factor in the
commander's estimate this may frequently be resolved into
terms of terrain Thus in the defense it may be vital to
hold certain dominating ground or to protect a certain defile
Similarly in the offense success may hinge on the capture
of such features which then become the immediate objective
of the attack Where possible it is an aid to proper evaluation
of the terrain to reduce the mission to terms of terrain
• 35 Maps are the basis for terrain studies but should be
checked by air reconnaissance 'air photographs and ground
reconnaissance Map errors must be expected Moreover
changes in the terrain especially in the road-net and drainage
system occur continually
• 36 Terrain can always be evaluated in terms of the following
five factors : observation fields of fire concealment
and cover obstacles and routes of communication
a Observation of the battlefield is essential in order to
bring effective fire to bear upon the enemy to control the
maneuver of one's own troops and to prevent surprise by the
enemy It is obtained from commanding elevations
b Fields of fire are essential to the defense On the offensive
the commander seeks to make his main attack in areas
lacking in good fields of fire to the defender Best fields of
fire are found in level or uniformly sloping streches of open
ground
c Concealment and cover may occur together Concealment
is protection against observation from the ground and
air Cover is protection against fire The ideal defensive
position is one having concealment and cover within but none
in front of it The attack is best favored by terrain affording
good concealment throughout the depth of the advance
Concealment and cover from ground weapons are to be
found in broken wooded terrain
d Obstacles are terrain features which impede the movement
of military forces They are of increasing importance
in modern warfare where masses of mechanized units are employed
Although chiefly of advantage to the defense they
3 62660-4 -3
27
36- 37
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
may be of great importance in protecting the flanks of attacking
units Some of the common terrain obstacles are
mountains rivers bodies of water marshes gullies steep inclines
and extensive woods
e Routes of communication include roads railrogds waterways
and airways and their facilities They are important
in both offensive and defensive operations for the movement
of troops and supplies Troops in small bodies move across
country readily but in the operations of large bodies of troops
routes of communication are of vital importance
5 37 Features such as bridges streams woods and towns
divide practically all terrain into more or less separate areas
Such an area frequently consists of a valley lying between
two ridges or an open space between two woods When the
terrain features enclosing the area prevent direct fire and
observation into it from positions outside the area is called a
compartment
A compartment of which the longer axis extends in the direction
of movement of a force or leads toward or into a
defensive position is called a corridor In -general a corridor
favors the attack because it limits observation and direct
fire from the flanks by the defender From the standpoint of
terrain it is desirable that boundaries between tactical units
in the attack should coincide generally with the boundaries
of corridors in order that a single unit may control the terrain
features from which direct fire can be brought to bear on
troops within the corridor
In the defense boundaries are usually located within corridors
To assure unity of defensive dispositions the boundary
within the corridor should be so located as to include within
the sector of a tactical unit of appropriate size avenues of
approach to the position To locate boundaries within an
avenue of approach divides responsibility at critical areas
A compartment which extends across the direction of
movement of a force or which extends parallel with a defensive
front is called a cross-corridor Cross-corridors favor
the defense However ridge lines perpendicular to the direction
of advance permit an attacker to deal successively with
elements of the hostile position During the advance these
crests offer the attacker facilities for observation and fire as
well as shelter behind which he may reorganize his units

CONDUCT IN BATTLE
39 The commander's decision for his unit as a whole and
the missions to subordinate units in support of the decision
are communicated to subordinates by clear and concise orders
which gives them freedom of action appropriate to their
professional knowledge to the situation to their dependability
and to the teamplay desired
40 After providing for the issuance of orders the commander
places himself where he can best control the course
of action and exert his leadership His command post affords
the advantage of established signal communication When
opportunity offers and when his presence at the command post
is not urgently required he visits his subordinate commanders
and his troops in order to inspire confidence and to assure
himself that his orders are understood and properly executed
• 4 Whenever the commander leaves his command post
he should orient his staff as to further plans to be made or
measures to be taken in anticipation of future contingencies
and should inform his staff where he can be reached
•
42 During the decisive phase of battle the place of the
commander is near the critical point of action
• 43 A commander influences the course of subsequent
action by his leadership by the use of his reserves by the
concentration of artillery and other supporting fires and by
the employment of combat aviation and armored units
44 The duration of a tactical operation can seldom be
predicted Successful engagements sometimes progress so
slowly that the gains made are not immediately apparent
At other times they progress so fast that the gains made can
be capitalized only by the most aggressive and farsighted
leadership
Troops are used up rapidly in the decisive phases of combat
This attrition must be anticipated by the commander
and his staff who take timely measures for replacement of
men units transport and weapons and for replenishment
of ammunition and other supplies When the situation permits
troops which have been heavily engaged are rested and
reorganized before being assigned a new and important
mission
29
45- 50
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
STAFF
2 45 The staff assists the commander to the extent that
he may require by providing information data and advice ;
by preparing detailed plans and orders in accordance with
his directions ; and by exercising such supervision over the
execution of his orders as he may prescribe A staff officer
as such does not exercise command
46 The staff may be divided into two groups-the general
staff and the special staff In large units these two staff
groups are separate and distinct ; In smaller units they merge
into each other and one staff officer frequently is charged
with duties pertaining to both staff groups
• 47 In every headquarters there is a constant tendency to
multiply personnel expand the functions of staff administration
and accumulate records and office equipment The
commander must avoid this expansion He must organize
his headquarters so as to maintain its readiness for prompt
movement
i 48 The organization functions and duties of the various
sections of the staff and the employment and duties of liaison
officers are prescribed in FM 0 -5
COMBAT ORDERS
• 49 The authority to issue orders is an inherent function
of command Orders are normally issued to next subordinate
commanders Bypassing the normal channels of command
is resorted to only in urgent situations; in such cases
both the commander issuing and the commander receiving
the order should notify intermediate commanders of its
purport as soon as possible
•
50 Orders may be either complete or fragmentary
The order is complete when it covers all essential aspects
and phases of the operation Complete orders include missions
to all subordinate units charged with the execution of
tactical operations in carrying out the commander's plan
Fragmentary orders are used when speed in delivery and
execution is imperative Fragmentary orders are issued successively
as the situation develops and decisions are made
and consist of separate instructions to one or more subordinate
30
OPERATIONS
50- 54
units prescribing the' part each is to play in the operation or
in the separate phases thereof This procedure will be usual
in divisions and smaller units Fragmentary orders may be
either oral or written They are concise but not at the
expense of clarity and omission of essential information
Instructions issued in fragmentary orders may be repeated in
a complete field order or in an annex if considered desirable
9 5 Orders should be originated sufficiently early and
transmitted in such form as to permit subordinate commanders
the maximum periods to reconnoiter to estimate
their own situations to issue their orders and to prepare
their troops for the contemplated operation Commanders
should be alert to forestall delays in the successive dissemination
of orders in their lower echelons
• 52 In many situations it may be necessary or desirable
to issue an order to warn of impending operations (warning
orders) A warning order contains information which enables
subordinate commanders to make preparations for a
contemplated operation Its principal purpose is to gain
time for preparatory measures and to conserve the energy
of the troops
• 53 An order should not trespass upon the province of a
subordinate It should contain everything that the subordinate
must know to carry out his mission but nothing more
54 Orders must be clear and explicit and as brief as is
consistent with clarity ; short sentences are easily understood
Clarity is more important than technique The more urgent
the situation the greater the need for conciseness in the
order Any statement of reasons for measures adopted
should be limited to what is necessary to obtain intelligent
cooperation from subordinates Detailed instructions for a
variety of contingencies or prescriptions that are a matter
of training do not inspire confidence and have no place in an
order Trivial and meaningless expressions divide responsibility
and lead to the adoption of half measures by subordinates
Exaggerated and bombastic phrases invite ridicule
and weaken the force of an order Expressions such as
"attack vigorously " if used in orders are not only verbose
and meaningless but tend to weaken the force of subsequent
orders in which such expressions do not appear
3
55- 58
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
∎ 55 Orders should prescribe only so far as conditions can
be foreseen Orders which attempt to regulate matters too
far in the future result in frequent changes Frequent
changes in orders overload the means of signal communication
cause confusion and misunderstanding impose needless
hardships on the troops and injure their morale '
Orders issued by subordinates should not be mere repetition
of those from higher authority with additions of their
own New orders are clearer and more satisfactory
• 56 As a rule it is desirable to keep contemplated operations
secret as long as possible and to confine knowledge
thereof to a few staff officers and senior commanders However
upon entry into' action no unit should be in doubt as
to what the commander wants it to do Whenever knowledge
of his intentions is necessary to insure the cooperation of the
units engaged a commander does not hesitate to disclose them
to all concerned Ignorance of his intentions may often
lead to inactivity on the part of subordinates
• 57 It is impossible to prescribe detailed forms of orders
to fit every tactical situation To attempt to do so would
result in a rigid form and a routine style of expression which
would not be in accord with the tactical requirements presented
by the diverse situations that arise in war To the
extent practicable however it has been found efficient and
convenient to clA-csify combat orders according to their purpose
and scope and for some of these to adopt a standard
sequence of composition This makes for ease of understanding
the avoidance of omissions and ready reference
Moreover experience has shown that an order which can
be misunderstood will be misunderstood and that to obviate

contained therein must be repeated in order to insure
coordination
• 59 In every unit standing operating procedure is prescribed
by the commander whenever practicable This procedure
covers those features of operations which lend themselves
to a definite or standardized procedure without loss of
effectiveness The adoption of such procedures will save time
in the preparation and issuance of orders minimize the
chances for confusion and errors when under stress of combat
and greatly simplify and expedite the execution of operations
in the field (See FM 0 -5 )
COMMAND POSTS
• 60 For convenience of operation in campaign the headquarters
of a large unit is divided into a forward and a rear
echelon When desirable headquarters of smaller units may
be similarly divided
The forward echelon consists of the staff agencies immediately
required by the commander for assistance in tactical
operations The rear echelon consists of the remaining staff
agencies which have administrative duties
• 6 The command post is the location of the forward
echelon of a headquarters All agencies of signal communication
center at the command post
62 In the selection of a command post consideration is
given to the disposition of troops in the plan of operations
routes of communication requirements of signal communication
space for staff activities cover and concealment
In the case of divisions and larger units the presence of
existing wire lines is important
Remote location of a command post with -respect to subordinate
units places an unnecessary burden on the means
of signal communication delays the transmission of orders
and information and makes tactical control difficult
Through the use of motor transport a command post can
be moved quickly over a considerable distance Frequent
changes in the location of the command post are avoided
particularly in large units In large units before a change
of location is made the necessary means of signal communication
for the new command post must be established
33
63- 68
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
• 63 A commander must keep superior and subordinate
units informed of the location and contemplated movement
of his command post
• 64 Each large unit announces the location of its command
post and when practicable the location of the command
post of each of its major subordinate units In rapidly mov'-"
Ing situations it • may be necessary to direct subordinate
units to select and report the locations of their own command
posts In closely coordinated operations requiring the
movement of command posts each large unit may designate
its own axis of signal communication by naming the probable
successive locations of its command post so far as such locations
can reasonably be foreseen and may similarly assign
an axis of signal communication to each of its major
subordinate units
• 65 On the march a command post may move by bounds
along a designated route or it may move at a designated place
in a column
• 66 In combat the location of command posts for small
units in proximity to a good observation post and for large
units in proximity to a suitable landing field is desirable
• 67 The ability of mechanized units and parachute troops
to strike quickly in rear areas indicates the necessity of locating
command posts well forward both in the offense and
defense A forward location assures a certain degree of all
around protection by the combat troops; the command post
will not so easily be cut off from the units it controls and the
nerve center of the command is favorably located to meet
rapidly changing situations
• 68 The maintenance of secrecy as to the location of command
posts particularly of large units is of great importance
They are the special objectives of hostile airplanes mechanized
units parachute troops and cavalry This threat
makes it necessary not only to provide security against surprise
attack from either the air or ground but also to use
great care not to disclose their locations to such troops
Concealment from the air is of major importance Traffic in
and out of command posts is rigidly controlled Landing
fields dropping and pick-up grounds and radio stations are
placed at a distance Signs to mark their locations and the

not at all; in place of signs guides are posted to point the
way and messengers are given more precise instructions
SIGNAL COMMUNICATION
• 69 The efficient exercise of command and the prompt
transmission of information and instructions require the
establishment of reliable means of signal communication
Signal communication is effected by technical means and by
messengers Entire dependence cannot be placed upon any
one means ; alternate means must be provided (See FM 24-5
and FM -5 )
• 70 Every commander is responsible for the establishment
and maintenance of the signal communication system of his
unit and for its efficient operation as a part of the system of
the next higher command Signal communication systems
must be simple flexible and properly used
The establishment and maintenance of signal communication
between superior and subordinate units is the responsibility
of the superior commander; between adjacent units as
directed by their common superior A unit supporting another
by fire is responsible for the establishment and maintenance
of signal communication with the supported unit
• 7 The various means of signal communication are so
employed that they supplement each other Those requiring
great expenditure of effort and materiel are not installed
when the service required can be effectively performed by less
elaborate means
• 72 When headquarters are in movement signal communication
is maintained between and within columns by means
of vehicular radio airplanes and motor or mounted messengers
73 The command posts and advance message centers are
the control points in the initial installation of the signal
communication system Early information is given to the
signal or communication officer of a unit relative to projected
operations and the location and movement of command posts
in order to facilitate the prompt establishment of signal communication
The necessary instructions therefor are prepared
by the unit signal or communication officer in accord-

ante with the directions of the commander Communication
officers of higher units maintain close cooperation with the
signal or communication officer of the subordinate unit
N 74 Message centers are operated at the command posts
of all units down to and including battalions and at the rear
echelons of headquarters of large units by the signal coma
munication personnel of the command Message centers
assist the commander and staff by coordinating the transmission
of outgoing orders reports and other messages with
the available signal agencies and by expediting the delivery of
incoming messages In general the cryptographing and decryptographing
of messages are the responsibility of the
message center
2 75 Advance message centers are established whenever
needed for the reception and relay of messages Information
as to their location is always transmitted to the troops
Advance message centers are frequently employed in the
reconnaissance operations of large units as collecting points
for messages of several reconnaissance detachments
0 76 The message center is not responsible for those messages
which area
Transmitted directly by the writer to the addressee by
telephone or personal agency

• 77 The message center transmits messages in accordance
with the classification as to urgency indicated by the writer
For classification of messages in accordance with the urgency
of handling see FM 0 - 0
• 78 The writer does not ordinarily designate the particular
means by which a message is to be sent If he desires a
message transmitted by a particular means he so marks it

visual and sound communication pigeons airplanes and
messengers

80 Wire communication (telephone telegraph and telegraph
printer) constitutes the basic technical means of

signal communication for the infantry division and this
larger unit headquarters It will not however always be
available for signal communication between forces operating
at a considerable distance from each other between troop
units and the higher command on the march and between
the advanced troops and the rear in combat Rapidly
changing situations such as a pursuit or retreat restrict the
practicability of its employment The possibility of failure
to function in critical situations must also be reckoned with
A wire system must therefore be supplemented by other
means
Although wire communication is a relatively safe means
there is always the possibility of hostile interception When
such interception is practicable it is inadvisable to employ
wire communication for 'the transmission in clear text of
plans which are not to be executed immediately
∎ 8 Radio communication is especially applicable in spanning
distances between widely separated mobile forces between
ground and air and in the fire-swept zone of the
forward area It is less vulnerable than wire communication
to hostile fire and is therefore a valuable supplement to wire
systems in combat It is subject however to static to
hostile interference to interception and to location by the
enemy
Interception of radio messages must be presumed Discretion
must be used even in the sending of messages in code
or cipher When prompt action is called for the commander
must decide whether the urgency of sending the message in
the clear outweighs the value to the enemy of information
contained therein Radio transmission in the clear is justified
in situations when the time available to the enemy is
insufficient for exploitation of the information contained in
the message
During certain phases of operations use of radio must be
rigidly restricted or' it may even be prohibited by higher
commanders
82 Visual signal communication (lamps flags pyrotechnics
panels) is not suitable for long messages or over long
distances but finds especial application for communicating
within and between small units and with airplanes by a few
short signals in accordance with a prearranged code (See
FM 24-5 )
37
83- 90
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
• 83 Sound communication is used chiefly to spread an
alarm as a means to attract attention and to transmit short
prearranged messages
84 Homing pigeons are a means of communicating from
front to the rear when other means have failed
85 Airplane messengers may be employed when distance
intervening obstacles on the ground or other factors of the
situation prevent the use of other means or when more rapid
transmission is required than can be otherwise accomplished
!~ 86 Signal communication between airplanes and ground
is accomplished by means of radio visual signals and drop
and pick-up messages In combat dropping and pick-up
grounds are established near unit command posts as required
On the march they are established near the location of higher
commanders and at points along the route of march Dropping
and pick-up grounds are identified by the display of
panels Moving vehicles designated to receive dropped messages
are provided means by which they can be easily identifled
from the air Airplanes in flight may be used to relay
radio messages between ground forces
0 87 Sole reliance cannot be placed upon the technical
means of signal communication Their absence or failure
to function does not relieve the commander of his responsibility
of keeping higher lower and adjacent units informed
of the situation Each commander provides for the transmission
of orders information and reports by means of
messengers
• 88 Messengers are dispatched by the most efficient means
of transport available In hostile territory it may be advantageous
to use airplanes or armored vehicles or to provide
an armed escort In combat mounted bicycle motorcycle
and motor messengers are employed as far forward as hostile
fire and the terrain will permit Runners are used in the
more advanced units
• 89 For covering long distances relays of messengers may
become necessary When relays are established ' relay (connecting)
posts are generally placed at well-marked points

CHAPTER 9
THE Or viiNSIVE
SECTION I
GENERAL
THE OBJECTIVE
0 450 An objective sometimes may be attained by maneuver
alone ; ordinarily it must be gained by battle A sound tactical
maneuver has a great influence on the successful outcome
of battle
8 45 The purpose of offensive action is the destruction of
the hostile armed forces To facilitate the accomplishment of
this purpose the commander selects a physical objective such
as a body of troops dominating terrain a center of lines of
communication or other vital area in the hostile rear for
his attack The attainment of this objective is the basis of
his own and all subordinate plans This objective should
have the following characteristics :
a Its capture must be possible within the time and space
limits imposed by the assigned mission
b Its capture should assure the destruction of the enemy
in his position or the threat of its capture should compel the
enemy to evacuate his position
c It should produce a convergence of effort
d It must be easily identified
e Its capture should facilitate contemplated future operations
PI 452 The objective having been selected all components are
directed in coordinated effort towards its attainment Actions
which do not contribute to this purpose are avoided
9 453 Sound tactical maneuver in the offensive is characterized
by a concentration of effort in a direction where success
will insure the attainment of the objective On the remainder
of the front are used only the minimum means necessary to
deceive the enemy and to hinder his maneuver to oppose
the main attack
97
454-460
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
DISTRIBUTION OF FORCES
• 454 In the offensive troops are distributed into two or
more principal tactical groupings : one or more main or decisive
attacks in which the greatest possible offensive power is
concentrated to bring about a decision and one or more
secondary or holding attacks whose mission is to render
maximum assistance to the main attack
Main attack groupings are designed to secure the objective
and to destroy the hostile force Secondary attack groupings
are designed to hold the enemy in position to force him to
commit his reserves prematurely and to an indecisive location
and to prevent him from reinforcing the front of the
main attack
• 455 In each tactical grouping the mass of the available
means of combat is concentrated in a main effort and is applied
in a decisive direction
• 456 Main attacks are characterized by narrow zones of
action by strong support of artillery tanks and other supporting
weapons by effective support of combat aviation and
by deep echelonment of reserves
• 457 Secondary attacks are characterized by lack of depth
reduction of reserves to the minimum maximum fire power in
the attacking echelon and by wide zones of action for the
attack units They will therefore usually be assigned limited
objectives initially
• 458 When it is impracticable to determine initially when
or where the main attack is to be made the commander retains
his freedom to act by disposing his forces in great
depth by holding out strong reserves and by maintaining
close control of his supporting weapons
• 459 Attacking echelons once committed to action lose their
immediate availability for employment in the execution of
other missions Deployed and under fire they can change
front only at the risk of incurring heavy losses The commander
can materially influence the course of an action once
begun through the employment of reserves fire support and
combat aviation
0 460 In selecting the direction for the main attack the
terrain must be carefully studied The choice of the front
98
OPERATIONS
460-463
on which the main attack and the main efforts of subordinate
units are made often is determined by the possibilities which
the terrain offers for effective employment of artillery and
mechanized units
Selection of the direction of the main attack also is influenced
by the time available for movement before the attack
must be launched In many situations the most rapid and
decisive results are to be expected when the main attack is
composed principally of large armored units or when such
units lead the main attack Air superiority and effective support
of the armored units by combat aviation are essential
to the sustained drive of the armored units
FORMS OF OFFENSIVE ACTION
•
46 Attack maneuvers are classified as envelopments and
penetrations
• 462 In an envelopment the main attack is directed against
the flank or rear of the initial disposition of the enemy's
main forces and toward an objective in rear of his front
lines It seeks to surround that portion of the enemy's forces
in front of the objective It is assisted usually by a secondary
attack directed against the enemy's front
A successful envelopment depends largely on the ucgree
of surprise attained and on the ability of the secondary attack
to contain the bulk of the enemy's forces Surprise is secured
by maneuvering to avoid observation by the enemy and by
deceiving him Superior mobility increases the prospect of
success
An envelopment avoids attacking on ground chosen by the
enemy and forces him to fight in two or more directions to
meet the converging efforts of the attack An envelopment
which strikes the defender's flank or rear so as to avoid any
part of his organized front and small-arms fire from that
front is preferable It minimizes losses handicaps the defender's
ability to meet it promptly compels the defender to
meet an attack on ground chosen by the attacker and when
successful is more decisive
• 463 A turning movement is an enveloping maneuver which
passes around the enemy's main forces striking at some vital
point deep in the hostile rear The force making the maneuver
usually operates so far from the secondary attack that the
99
463-465
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
principal tactical groupings are beyond mutual supporting
distance (the distance by which forces may be separated and
yet permit one to move to the aid of another before it can be
defeated by an enemy force) ; hence each grouping must be
strong enough or mobile enough to avoid defeat in detail
When conditions favor such action all combat elements of
the command may be employed in the turning force leaving
only reconnaissance elements confronting the hostile dispositions
The turning movement is adapted particularly to
highly mobile commands such as cavalry armored and motorized
forces and forces transported by aircraft It is invariably
employed by highly mobile forces in situations in
which the vital objective in the hostile rear can be seized by
such a maneuver before it is necessary to involve the enveloping
force in a major engagement with the enemy Deception
secrecy and mobility are vital to successful execution of a
turning movement
• 464 When the enemy takes up a defensive position the
commander of the attacking forces should consider the possibility
of turning the enemy out of his position and forcing
him to withdraw and fight on ground more favorable to the
attacker
Situations may occur especially in the pursuit of a defeated
force in which the enemy can be forced by direct
attack to take up a defensive position while a portion of the
more mobile attacking forces executes a turning movement
against his lines of communication
• 465 A double envelopment is executed by three principal
tactical groups two enveloping attack forces and a secondary
attack force A simultaneous envelopment of both flanks
generally requires considerable superiority
The command seeking to attack by double development
must be deployed or capable of deploying on a broad front
against an enemy on a much narrower front or with little
capability or room for maneuver The maneuver is executed
by fighting a holding battle with the center while enveloping
forces strike on both hostile flanks When mobile' forces are
available in reserve they may complete the envelopment by
an attack from the rear When conditions favor it this
form of maneuver should be used because of the decisive
results it promises
00
OPERATIONS
466-469
• 466 An envelopment of one flank is executed by two principal
tactical groups the main or enveloping attack force
and the secondary attack force After an initial envelopment
of one flank favorable conditions for passing to a
double envelopment through the use of reserves may be created
when the success of our troops has placed the enemy in
a disadvantageous situation
• 467 The enemy's preparations to meet an envelopment of
his flank ordinarily cannot be organized as completely as
the defense of his front especially if the envelopment is
launched from a locality deep on the hostile flank or rear
The defender strengthens an unsupported flank by reserves
echeloned in depth and in width When threatened
with envelopment he moves them to meet the maneuver He
may attempt to envelop the attacking forces or to extend
his flank beyond that of the attack up to the limit of his
strength An attempt on the part of the attacker to meet
such hostile extension may lead to overextension or to a dangerous
separation of the enveloping forces from those making
the secondary attack It usually is better to take advantage
of the enemy's extension and consequent weakness
by retaining a deep formation and to penetrate his thinly
held front than to overextend in an effort further to outflank
the position When the enemy extends his position
beyond the enveloping forces particular attention must be
paid to protecting the exterior flank by the use of the general
reserves of the higher commander
II 468 In a penetration the main attack passes through some
portion of the area occupied by the enemy's main forces and
is directed on an objective in his rear It is characterized
by the complete rupture of the enemy's dispositions ; the
seizure of the objective by operations through the gap ; and
the envelopment of one or both flanks created by the breakthrough
The essential conditions for success are surprise sufficient
fire power especially combat aviation and artillery to neutralize
the front of penetration favorable terrain within the
hostile position for the advance of the attacking troops and
strength to carry the attack through to its objective
0 469 When the situation does not favor an envelopment
the main attack is directed to penetrate the hostile front
0
469-47
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
Conditions which demand a penetration are enemy's flanks
unassailable ; lack of time to make an enveloping maneuver
Conditions which favor a penetration are overextension of
the enemy ; terrain and observation favorable for more effective
cooperation of the combined arms Such an attack often
can be organized more quickly than can an envelopment
! 470 In the penetration of a defensive position the main
attack is launched on a front wider than that of the contemplated
break-through in order to hold the enemy in place
on the flanks of the penetration The attack on the remainder
of the hostile front is designed to contain the enemy
and prevent him from moving his reserves
The amount of artillery mechanized units and supporting
combat aviation available largely determines the width of
the front of penetration The wider the front of penetration
the deeper can it be driven and the more difficult will it be
for the enemy to close the gap The deeper the penetration
the more effective will be the action of mobile reserves in
seizing the objective and rolling up the hostile flanks
The greatest distribution in depth is placed opposite the
prospective front of penetration The distribution of troops
provides for three separate impulses ; a break through the
hostile position a widening of the gap thus created by enveloping
one or both interior hostile flanks and the seizure of the
objective and exploitation of the success
The sequence of these impulses depends on the situation
In some situations it is practicable through the existence of
weaknesses or gaps in the enemy's front for mobile troops
(armored motorized or cavalry divisions) to break through
and to proceed straight to the objective while operations of
local envelopment and exploitation are performed by less
mobile troops In other situations foot troops must break
through the more mobile troops being held initially in reserve
and used later to operate through the gap created by
the foot troops
i 47 The mission of the attacking echelon of troops is to
break through the enemy's dispositions so that he will be
unable to reconstitute his front on a rearward line Until
this mission has been accomplished the attacking troops do
not divert their strength to the attack of the flanks of the
gap Hostile counterattacks against the flanks of the pene-
02
OPERATIONS
47 -474
tration are met by reserves by the fire of the artillery and
by combat aviation
The missions of rolling up the flanks of a gap created by
penetration and of exploiting the break-through are assigned
to reserves Cavalry armored and motorized units are especially
suitable for seizing the objective and for exploitation
These units are supported by combat aviation operating
against hostile reserves and artillery and other important
objectives Troops transported by air may be used to support
these operations
∎ 472 In large commands a penetration often is initiated by
launching simultaneously two or more powerful attacks (a
multiple penetration) against weak localities on the hostile
front Strong localities are contained initially by secondary
attacks When the penetrating attacks have advanced far
enough to permit the interior strong localities are reduced
by maneuver and the penetrating attacks are united into a
single main attack The pinching out of strong hostile localities
often is facilitated by launching multiple penetrations in
converging directions The doctrines applicable to a single
penetration govern the organization and conduct of a multiple
penetration
∎ 473 Whether the maneuver adopted is an envelopment or
a penetration success will depend primarily on intelligent
energetic and coordinated execution This execution must
be based on a sound plan which is influenced largely by the
objective and direction of the main attack
The doctrines which underlie the employment of the combined
arms in the offensive are conservation of the combat
power of troops in the attack echelon provision of assistance
for them to close with the enemy and thereafter support of
their attack until the enemy's power of resistance is broken
FRONTAGES AND DEPTHS
∎ 474 The frontage assigned to any unit in an attack varies
with the mobility type of armament mission and combat
power of the unit the terrain the amount of fire support
available and the probable hostile resistance As a general
guide an infantry battalion at full strength in a main attack
seldom is assigned a frontage less than 500 yards or more
than 000 yards measured on the front of the hostile position
03
475-480
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
0 475 Units are distributed in depth to provide flexibility of
maneuver continuity in the attack and security For infantry
units depth of formation for combat rather than a wide
extension of front is necessary in the initial deployment
The progress of battle will call for maneuvers that cannot be
clearly foreseen This condition can be met only by initial
distribution in depth
Laterally the distribution of troops in attack is governed
principally by the doctrine of the main attack and main effort
It is influenced also by the relative advantages offered by
different sections of the terrain When the situation requires
an unusually wide extension of the command the increase
is effected by widening the gaps between units
RESERVES
∎ 476 The initial strength and location of the reserve will
vary with its contemplated missions the type of maneuver
possible hostile reaction and clarity of the situation After
the attack is launched the reserve and the fires of supporting
arms are the principal means available to the commander for
shaping the course of action and for enforcing favorable
decision
The primary mission of the reserve is to enter the action
offensively at the proper place and moment to clinch the
victory Hence its initial strength and location are Controlled
largely by the maneuver to be executed
2 477 In a penetration the reserve must be large enough to
exploit the break-through by enveloping one or both of the
flanks created and by operating deep in the hostile rear
To facilitate its rapid movement through the gap the reserve
is located generally in rear of the main attack
• 478 In an envelopment the reserve must be large enough
to extend the envelopment or to exploit a successful enveloping
action by operating against the hostile rear To favor
the envelopment the reserve is disposed toward the flank
enveloped
• 479 When open flanks exist or when there is' danger of a
hostile threat some reserves are disposed to meet dangerous
contingencies
0 480 When the situation is relatively clear and enemy capabilities
are limited the reserve may consist of a small fraction
04
situation is obscure the reserve may consist initially of the
bulk of the command centrally located and prepared to
move to any point on the front or flanks
• 48 The location of the reserve should combine a maximum
of protection for itself against hostile observation and air
and mechanized attack with a road net which facilitates rapid
movement to any point of possible employment Motor vehicles
should be held available for the movement of reserves
lacking organic means of rapid movement
• 482 Choosing the proper time at which the reserve should
be used is often the commander's most difficult and most
important decision
Nevertheless at the decisive moment of action every man
that can be used to advantage must participate in the battle
and the reserve must be launched without hesitation As far
as practicable the reserve is sent in by complete units Reinforcement
by driblets is avoided Commanders endeavor
to reconstitute reserves from troops which the course of the
action has made available
COORDINATION
•
483 The commander is responsible for coordination of the
action of all elements of his command
• 484 In all cases the highest degree of coordination permitted
by the situation and time element is sought The
considerations discussed below are applicable in general to
situations in which thorough coordination can be prescribed
In other situations they are applied to the degree practicable
0 485 Against a strong enemy a decision to develop and deploy
for attack directly from march columns risks loss of
control and sacrifices some of the capabilities of artillery
tanks and other supporting weapons Ordinarily an attack
in a moving situation may be organized and coordinated in
assembly positions
• 486 From a march formation the commander develops
the main body for a coordinated attack by assigning march
objectives to the larger units usually the assembly positions
they are to occupy and routes or zones of advance thereto
The development order announces the missions of units

administrative details so that the necessary preparations
can be made Instructions given in the development order are
as complete as possible so that the attack order may be brief
For movement to assembly positions and security during
development see paragraphs 364-369 and 436-438
0 487 The location of assembly positions is dependent on
several factors Darkness cover from observed hostile artillery
fire a thorough knowledge of the situation and a plan
of attack already decided favor advanced positions located
in conformity with the plan of maneuver Conditions the
reverse of these indicate the selection of assembly positions
well back
Units of high mobility such as tanks cavalry and armored
forces may complete their development and preparations
for battle at greater distances from the hostile front
If the plan of attack involves an enveloping maneuver the
assembly position of the enveloping force is set off at a sufficient
interval from the troops in the secondary attack to
preclude interference between units when deployed for attack
0 488 Subordinate commanders assigned assembly positions
may in turn assign more advanced assembly positions to the
component units of their commands as knowledge of the
situation and of plans becomes available The final assembly
position of an infantry battalion in the attack echelon usually
is in the most forward concealed position available in rear
of the line of departure It should afford cover from hostile
small-arms fire
8 489 While units are moving into and during the occupation
of their assembly positions the commander prepares his
orders and completes arrangements for the execution of his
plan of maneuver
Commanders of troops in the attack echelon and the
commanders of units designated to support them coordinate
the action of their units Reconnaissance is initiated by all
commanders prior to arrival in their final assembly positions
It 490 As each unit arrives in its assembly position measures
are taken immediately for security and for clearing the roads
06
Signal communication is established without delay between
the superior command post and the major subordinate units
Equipment not essential to combat is disposed of extra ammunition
is issued to troops reconnaissances are completed
coordination of the plans of maneuver and plans of fire of
subordinate units is completed and attack orders are issued
promptly
• 49 Development of the command terminates with the
troops distributed in accordance with the plan for their
employment and in an approach march formation favoring
rapid deployment
• 492 Should the commander decide that rapidity of action
is essential to retain a tactical advantage he may dispense
with assembly positions decentralize operations to combat
teams or task forces and issue orders to those units to develop
and attack
Y 493 Subordinate units to be deployed for attack ordinarily
are assigned a zone of action and a direction of attack or an
objective Zones of action regulate the limits for battle
reconnaissance and combat of the unit It is not necessary
that troop formations extend across the entire zone of action
of a unit as part of the zone of action can often be covered by
fire by small patrols or by both A preponderance of force
on any particular part of the front is obtained by varying
the zones of action of subordinate units
Zones of action are defined by designating their lateral
boundaries or by the assignment of a front of deployment and
the designation of the lateral limits of the objective An
open flank ordinarily is not bounded In some situations the
designation of the Objective is sufficient to indicate the zone
of action In large units the designation of objectives and
boundaries may be made from the map ; in small units these
designations are made on the ground Points designated
should be identified easily on the ground
Zones of action should extend through the depth of the
hostile position at least as far as the location of the hostile
artillery Important localities and terrain corridors commensurate
with the*size of a tactical unit should lie wholly
within the zone of action of that unit If it is desired that an
adjacent unit render special assistance to another in the

attack this assistance should be clearly stated During the
progress of combat and especially when reserves are committed
to action appropriate changes in zones of action are
made
To take advantage of favorable routes of approach units
may move temporarily into adjacent zones Such movement
must not interfere with the action of adjacent units or result
in a dangerous massing of troops The emplacement and
movement of artillery and other supporting weapons in zones
of action adjacent to the zone of the units they support are
permissible but must be carefully coordinated (See par 538 )
The battalion is ordinarily the smallest unit which is
assigned a zone of action Smaller units are usually assigned
directions and objectives
When lateral boundaries are not clearly defined they are
supplemented by assigning compass directions of attack
This is particularly important in small units
When tactical groupings are separated initially by wide
intervals and the direction of their subsequent maneuvers
cannot be foreseen designation of a boundary between them
may be withheld until a later phase of the action In such
situations it frequently will be necessary to establish a limiting
line between them for coordination and control of their
supporting fires
• 494 A line of departure usually is designated from which
the attacking troops are launched at the prescribed hour or
separate lines of departure and hours are assigned to the
several attacking units The purpose of the line of departure
is to coordinate the advance of the attack echelon so that its
elements will strike the enemy in the order and at the time
desired This line should be recognized easily on the ground
and should be approximately perpendicular to the direction
of attack
• 495 The time of attack is the hour at which the attack is
to be launched If a line of departure is prescribed it is the
hour at which the line is to be crossed by the leading elements
of the attack It is determined by the time required for
commanders to make the necessary reconnaissance prepare
plans and issue orders : for the cooperating arms to coordinate
their plans; and for the attack echelon tq organize its
attack and move to position
08
OPERATIONS
495-499
The secondary attack may precede the main attack to force
the enemy to commit the greatest possible portion of his forces
against that attack or the main and secondary attacks may
be launched simultaneously
Unity of effort is promoted by assigning subordinate units
objectives which insure mutual support and by prescribing
where and in what direction subordinate units are to make
their main effort The combat action and direction of attack
taken by subordinate commanders must be such as to build
up the main effort of the tactical grouping in accordance with
the intentions of the superior commander
The commander must endeavor constantly to prevent the
attack from breaking up into a series of uncoordinated
combats
• 496 The degree of surprise attained is dependent in a large
measure on the coordination and timing of the measures
taken to deceive the enemy Ruses demonstrations feints
and other measures for deception executed at the wrong time
and place will be obvious to an alert enemy and will warn
him of the impending attack Superior mobility and speed
of execution may be determining factors in achieving
surprise
• 497 The best guarantee for success in the attack is effective
cooperation between the troops in the attack echelon
the supporting artillery and any supporting combat aviation
The superior commander coordinates the fire support of his
artillery with the plan of maneuver of the attacking troops
Acting through the commander of supporting combat aviation
he coordinates the fire support of the combat aviation
with the fire of his artillery his plan of maneuver and his
plan of employment of mechanized units
• 498 To assure close cooperation with the attacking troops
artillery units assigned to direct support of designated units
maintain constant connection with supported units through
common command posts or by liaison' agents Ordinarily an
artillery battalion is placed in direct support of an infantry
regiment or a cavalry brigade Cooperation is facilitated by
habitually associating the same units on the march and in
combat

of the senior artillery commander of a smaller force of
combined arms
Subordinate artillery commanders establish their command
posts where they can exercise tactical command and
fire direction most effectively If an artillery commander
locates his command post at a place other than the command
post of the supported unit he establishes liaison and
maintains signal communication with the commander of the
supported unit
• 500 The commander of the supported unit informs the
supporting artillery commander of the situation his plan of
attack and the artillery support desired The supporting
artillery commander informs the commander of the unit of
the number and general location of his batteries the present
location of the artillery observation posts and those that must
be seized during the advance the terrain which the artillery
commands with observation and fire and the means by which
the artillery can most effectively support the attack (See
par 528 )
Based on this exchange of information the associated commanders
arrange the plan of fire support to be given by the
artillery during the attack
The artillery commander must comply with the requests of
the supported unit commander to the limit of his capabilities
subject only to orders received from higher authority If he
receives a fire mission which conflicts with the needs of the
supported troops he reports the situation to the commander
ordering the mission and then complies with the resulting
decision If the urgency of the situation precludes this report
the artillery commander acts on his own initiative in accordance
with his knowledge of the situation reporting his action
to his superior at the first opportunity
As a rule a liaison section is assigned to each infantry battalion
or cavalry regiment A mutual obligation rests upon
the commanders of supported and supporting units that
liaison once established is maintained It is essential that the
supporting artillery know at all times the location of the leading
elements of the attack echelon and be kept informed of
the plans of the supported unit
•

ments the artillery fire of direct support chiefly by engaging
targets in the immediate foreground whose neutralization by
artillery might endanger the attack echelon and targets
within range on which artillery fire cannot be placed
• 502 The action of combat aviation in support of ground
troops is closely coordinated with the plan of attack Its
first objectives are those hostile elements the destruction or
neutralization of which will contribute most toward a successful
attack During battle combat aviation is especially
useful as a means immediately available to a commander
to exploit a success to correct an adverse situation to attack
reserves or reinforcements or to support ground troops in
overcoming unexpected resistance Its employment to complement
the fire of artillery in a crisis or in fast moving situations
is habitu especially in attacks by tanks and armored
forces
• 503 To assure effective cooperation supporting combat
aviation should operate from landing fields within short
flying time of the zone of action and must be included in the
air-ground radio net and wire net of supported units To
facilitate coordination of its effort with that of the ground
troops a liaison officer from supporting combat aviation
should be with the supported unit Supported ground troops
must keep supporting combat aviation informed of the location
of leading elements and of plans of maneuver and fire
It is especially important that adequate means of identification
of friendly ground troops be carefully arranged and
coordinated
• 504 An integration of the attack into a unified whole requires
complete coordination and cooperation prior to and
during the operation between supporting tanks artillery
and combat aviation (See chs 2 and 6 )
H 505 Because of the difficulty of establishing and maintaining
effective chemical concentrations in mobile operations
use by the attacker of chemical agents other than smoke is
limited Smoke must be carefully employed in respect to
both time and space and must be closely coordinated with
other supporting fires and with the action of tanks and supporting
aviation Under favorable conditions of wind and
weather smoke is used to blind hostile observation posts antitank
guns and infantry supporting weapons to conceal the

approach of the attack echelon and to protect the flanks of
the attack It is especially useful during shortt periods when
troops must cross exposed ground
506 As soon' as the commander has made his decision he
completes his plan of attack and issues his attack order
wherein he prescribes the necessary coordination for the
action (See FM 0 -5 )
507 When conditions limit the ability of the commander to
exercise a timely and direct influence on the action the initiative
of subordinates must be relied upon to a great extent
The commander issues less detailed orders to those tactical
groupings over whose action he can not exercise a direct influence
and attaches to them the means necessary to accomplish
their tasks He remains with and personally directs
the action of the troops whose mission is of decisive importance
to the action This method of conducting an operation
is most prevalent in pursuits in opening phases of a meeting
engagement during crises of battle and in envelopments in
which the main and secondary attacks are separated by wide
intervals The greatest degree of coordination possible is
prescribed initially; complete coordination is accomplished
as soon as the course of action permits (See par 25 )
0 508 Coordination is assured by command and staff visits
to subordinates to see that orders are understood and are being
carried out
SECTION II
ATTACK IN WAR OF MOVEMENT
509 A meeting engagement is a collision between two opposing
forces more or less unprepared for battle Ordinarily
the collision is caused by uncertainty or obscurity in the situation
This aspect is often present in the operations of
small units and in situations where the means of reconnaissance
have failed or are unable to operate
A meeting engagement may ensue when each opponent is
cognizant of the other; yet both decide to attack without
delay to retain some tactical advantage to gain a decisive
terrain feature or from a feeling of superiority It may
occur when one opponent decides to deploy hastily for defense
while the other attacks' before this defense can be
organized
2
OPERATIONS
5 0-5 4
5 0 In open warfare immediate orders and rapid action
axe essential By the prompt exercise of initiative endeavor
must be made to deprive the enemy of his freedom of action
and prevent the coordinated employment of his forces A
great advantage accrues to the force which first succeeds in
making effective preparations Action cannot be delayed
awaiting the results of detailed reconnaissances Prompt estimate
of the situation quick decision and prompt attack are
essential to success
The tactical situation which develops on first contact has a
strong influence on the subsequent course of action Commanders
must be well forward when the enemy is engaged ;
otherwise units may be employed improperly
Opportunities for decisive action must be exploited immediately
The rapidity of modern combat frequently makes
the time element decisive
8 5 Open warfare requires the widest possible exercise of
initiative by commanders of all echelons in the execution of
the general mission assigned to the command
Information gained by reconnaissance agencies during the
advance affords a basis for the commander's preliminary disposition
and may enable him to determine the general line
of engagement with the enemy and the plan of attack As
a rule however the enemy's intentions will remain obscure
and will seldom be clarified until after the initial engagement
• 5 2 As soon as the prospect of an engagement becomes
apparent the superior commander initiates plans for the
operation and disposes his command to facilitate its rapid
entry into action One or more advance message centers are
established to facilitate prompt signal communication
Early and rapid transmission of orders to elements of the
main body is essential to an orderly and timely employment
of the command and may be vital particularly in columns of
high mobility
• 5 3 Initial orders are ordinarily issued in fragmentary
form to the various elements of the command The sequence
in which orders are issued is based upon the priority of and
the time required for execution
• 5 4 When timely information of the enemy is lacking
subordinate commanders are relied upon to exercise their
initiative and make important decisions in consonance with
3
5 4-5 7
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
the general mission and the intentions of the superior commander
Without delay the superior commander coordinates
the action which his subordinates have initiated (See
par 507 )
∎ 5 5 Employment of the advance guard is the commander's
first problem and is the basis for the employment of the
remainder of the main body When contact is imminent or
when entering the zone of effective hostile artillery fire the
advance guard moves forward on a broad front When hostile
resistance is encountered the advance guard must secure
possession of terrain that will afford good observation for
the artillery and other supporting weapons and gain the
time and space required for the development and deployment
of the main body These missions require aggressive action
against the enemy's leading troops Unfavorable terrain or
an encounter with superior hostile forces may make a temporary
defense or a limited retirement advisable to preserve
the commander's freedom of action However all advanceguard
actions are characterized by speed and aggressiveness
by broad fronts and by small or no reserves
The advance guard performs its mission most effectively
when after securing possession of the essential terrain features
it is disposed to protect the deployment of the main body Its
artillery deploys on a broad front opens long-range fire on
enemy columns forcing them to an early deployment and
interdicts the principal routes of approach
The advance guard is strongly reinforced by artillery from
the main body and by supporting combat aviation It is
reinforced with other elements of the main body only when
the situation clearly demands it
5 6 Cavalry after withdrawal from the front of advanceguard
infantry may be employed on the flanks to screen our
own dispositions to execute reconnaissance or harassing
action against the hostile flanks and rear or may be held
in reserve
5 7 The speed of modern offensive operations demands
that supporting artillery be prepared to react immediately
with fire when opportune targets are presented To do this
artillery observation and positions must be as far forward
as possible
Early entry into action of the bulk of the artillery with the
4

5 7-520
main body is essential to protect the development to give
support and cohesion to the advance-guard action and to
gain an early superiority over the hostile artillery
It may be necessary for a portion of the artillery to occupy
temporary firing positions to Insure that troops do not come
under hostile fire without artillery protection
• 5 8 The artillery preferably is deployed initially so that
it can protect the development and support the attack from
the same position areas 'When initial positions are too distant
the artillery in direct support must so displace forward
as to assure close support of the attack echelon
While other troops are organizing their attack the artillery
completes preparation of firing data and arrangements
for supporting the attack Observation aviation is placed
at the disposal of the artillery commander in order that
the hostile artillery and large troop assemblies may be located
and fire conducted on important targets at long range
• 5 9 In accordance with his estimate of the situation the
commander develops the main body and organizes a coordinated
attack or attacks directly from march columns
with a part of his command and organizes a more coordinated
attack with the remainder or attacks with his whole force
from march columns as units become available (See pars
485-487 492 and 507 )
• 520 Regardless of whether the attack is launched from
assembly positions or directly from march columns the
method of approach to the hostile position is the same
Each battalion of the attack echelon moves to the most advanced
position In which it can make its final preparations
under cover from hostile small-arms fire
The commander of each attack unit directs its advance
in the assigned zone of action so as to be able to cross the
line of departure at the prescribed hour Each attack unit
reconnoiters its zone of action and supports the reconnaissance
elements with Its supporting weapons To keep troops
in hand prior to contact with the hostile forces a base unit
is usually designated on which the other units regulate their
advance from one terrain line to the next Terrain features
which afford extended observation or which are otherwise
of tactical importance are the objectives of each bound

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
• 52 Whether an offensive battle is the result of a meeting
engagement or is based on the attack of an organized position
the conduct of the attack from the time the enemy is
engaged until he is defeated is essentially the same What
difference there is exists in the coordination power and
speed developed in the opening phases (See pars 535-572 )
SECTION III
ATTACK OF AN ORGANIZED POSITION
PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS
• 522 Ordinarily the defender will attempt to screen his
main position and deceive the attacker regarding his dispositions
by the employment of covering forces A thorough
reconnaissance of the hostile position and its foreground is of
primary importance This reconnaissance seeks to determine
the location depth and extension of the hostile position
the hostile occupation of the position contaminated areas the
location of the hostile artillery and natural and artificial tank
obstacles It involves a thorough study of the map and air
photographs of the enemy's combat zone and the use of
available air and ground reconnaissance agencies
• 523 If air reconnaissance and advance detachments fail to
establish definitely the main hostile position the leading
troops are reinforced strongly by artillery combat aviation
other supporting weapons and if necessary by tanks Rifle
reinforcements are held to a minimum The reinforced leading
troops execute a reconnaissance in force against critical
points in the enemy's outpost zone to drive in the enemy's
covering forces and determine the hostile main position
Their mission is to seize the terrain which will permit the
proper deployment of the command and permit observation
of the hostile battle position
When the leading troops finally encounter a well-organized
system of defensive fires of hostile artillery and other supporting
weapons it may be taken as a reliable indication that
the hostile battle position has been reached The leading
troops establish themselves on the critical points and cover
the deployment of the mass of the artillery
•
524 During these preliminary operations cavalry and other
troops seek to locate the flanks of the hostile position The
6
OPERATIONS
524-527
leading elements are protected from hostile counterattack by
strong supporting fires and by the presence of other units
moved to concealed positions within supporting distance The
remainder of the command is held in readiness beyond the
range of effective hostile artillery fire Necessary measures
are taken to protect it against air attack and attack by
mechanized units
• 525 Reconnaissance is continued to obtain information as
a basis for the conduct of the attack This reconnaissance
provides more detailed information for the assignment of
objectives and as a basis for the plan of fire of the artillery
and the other supporting weapons
Reconnaissance of the terrain must determine the most
favorable routes of approach to the hostile position the
nature and strength of obstacles and the possibilities for
employment of mechanized units
Air photographs of the hostile main position are distributed
to subordinate commanders
The terrain over which the attack must pass is studied on
the ground and from air photographs to determine the terrain
compartments which the defender has organized for
defense and can cover with defensive fires and the areas in
which the attacker can advance best by flanking fire and
maneuver
Artillery conducts reconnaissance to determine the possibilities
of artillery observation and fire and the location of
its firing positions and the routes of approach thereto
• 526 Determination of the weak points in the enemy dispositions
is of vital importance By fire of artillery and other
supporting weapons delivered from different directions and
by feints and raids effort is made to ascertain the enemy's
dispositions and his plan of defensive fires
PREPARATIONS FOR ATTACK
527 Based on the estimate of the situation the main attack
is made either as an envelopment or a penetration A carefully
coordinated attack is required Orders are issued for
the preparations for the attack and for the measures for
secrecy and deception to be adopted
Preparations for the attack include the completion of the
signal communication system organization of the command

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
for combat provision for ammunition supply and the regulation
and coordination of supporting fires of all arms
Special consideration is given during the preparation to
measures designed to insure the continuity of the attack
Adequate provision is made for placing in readiness the necessary
material and engineer units to destroy obstacles assist
the advance of tanks and heavy weapons and for the construction
of roads connecting our own system with that of
the enemy
All preparations for the attack are completed as far as
practicable before the occupation of final assembly positions
Preparatory measures likely to betray the imminence of the
attack are carried out secretly or are deferred as long as
possible
Restrictions are imposed on those activities within our front
lines and in rear areas which may disclose to hostile reconnaissance
operations for the attack Strict surveillance is
imposed on the use of radio communication
0 528 The plan of attack consists of the plan of maneuver
and plan of fire The attack unit artillery and supporting
combat aviation commanders make detailed arrangements
for coordinating the action of their units to carry out the
common mission (See pars 498-500 )
In coordinating their plans it is essential that the supported
and supporting commanders carefully study the successive
compartments of terrain in which hostile resistance
may be encountered and identify the successive intermediate
objectives of the attack
An agreement is reached relative to the known targets to
be taken under fire respectively by the artillery by combat
aviation and by the other supporting weapons Areas to be
kept under surveillance for targets appearing after the attack
is launched especially those targets in adjacent zones which
are dangerous to the advance are agreed upon Associated
commanders must arrange for mutual reinforcement of fire
529 Attack unit commanders must receive early information
of their assembly positions and zones of action in order
that they may make their own reconnaissances and formulate
plans
Attack units usually move at night into final assembly
positions preparatory to an attack the next morning Move-

ment of units into their assembly positions by day generally
is practicable only when visibility is poor or when overwhelming
artillery and combat aviation support is available
When tanks are employed their assembly positions and
routes of approach are reconnoitered marked and prepared
530 The first mission of the artillery is to protect the
movement into and the assembly positions of attack units
During this phase hostile artillery and observation posts constitute
its principal targets Registration fires should be
conducted so as not to disclose the impending attack The
artillery gives special consideration to those measures which
will attain surprise in the opening of effective fire gain fire
superiority over the hostile artillery and concentrate the
mass of its fire on the decisive objectives
0 53 Artillery positions are selected so that fire can be concentrated
on the objectives of the attack Defilade concealment
from air reconnaissance and proximity to observation
are sought Sufficient time is allowed for the preparation of
firing data establishment of signal communication and organization
of the artillery ammunition supply
Artillery usually moves into position by echelon The
movement is frequently wholly or partly executed at night
Units assigned to positions screened from hostile air reconnaissance
are moved first The movement of artillery is
regulated to avoid interfering with the attack echelon in its
occupation of final assembly positions Long-range artillery
is placed well forward to be able to take under fire the most
distant echelons of the defender's light and medium artillery
0 532 During the advance of the attack echelon from assembly
positions the hostile artillery constitutes the principal
target of our artillery fire Superiority over the hostile artillery
is indispensable for the success of the attack It
rarely can be attained after the attack is launched
Located hostile batteries are silenced early in the artillery
action Their neutralization then is maintained by a portion
of the artillery in order that the mass may be employed on
other missions until again required for counterbattery fire as
new hostile batteries are located If counterbattery fire is
unable to gain superiority over the hostile artillery neutralization
of the hostile observation just prior to the attack
is of great importance
9
533-535
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
533 Artillery fires prior to the hour of attack may be limited
to normal fires already in progress or the attack may
be preceded by an artillery preparation
The duration of the preparation varies with the situation
A prolonged preparation is destructive of surprise and gives
the enemy time to take countermeasures The length of the
preparation is influenced also by the extent to which tanks
are to participate in the attack and the role assigned to
them The duration of the artillery preparation may vary
from 5 minutes to several hours
The nature of the artillery preparation depends upon its
mission Concentration of effect is greatly favored by dividing
the preparation into phases
The object of the first phase of the preparation is to neutralize
the defender's artillery destroy the most important
hostile agencies of command and fire control isolate the
defender's forces from the rear disrupt assembled hostile
mechanized forces and protect our troops from the enemy's
counterpreparation fires Artillery fire of the first phase
comprises counterbattery fire ; destruction fire on command
posts observation posts and signal communication Installations
; interdiction and destruction fire on enemy routes of
communication; destruction fire on mine fields and hostile
obstacles ; and concentrations on the hostile defense areas
and assembled mechanized units
In the subsequent phase of the preparation sufficient artillery
continues counterbattery fire to maintain neutralization
of the hostile artillery The fire of the mass of the remaining
artillery is concentrated on the hostile defense areas
• 534 During the preparation other supporting weapons
fire on sensitive points in the advanced zone of resistance
Supporting bombardment aviation is concentrated against
hostile artillery signal communication centers and reserves
with particular attention to mechanized units which cannot
be covered effectively by artillery During the last few minutes
of the preparation bombardment aviation; is concentrated
upon the hostile defense areas
CONDUCT OF THE ATTACK
• 535 The attack is characterized by the positive action of
fire and movement combined and controlled to create a preponderance
of force in the decisive direction
20
OPERATIONS
536-538
• 536 The attacking echelon advances from its final assembly
positions so as to cross the line of departure at the
prescribed time Any mass formation of units runs grave
risks of incurring heavy losses from hostile counterpreparation
fires and air attack The leading echelon is therefore
thin initially ; its fire power is gradually built up as the
enemy discloses his plan of defense
When fire superiority has been gained the leading echelon
closes to assaulting distance
• 537 Superiority of fire rests chiefly upon the mutual support
of units in the attacking echelon and the coordination
of their action with the fire support of artillery bombardment
aviation and supporting tanks It depends not only on volume
of fire but also on its direction and accuracy
Fire effect is increased by enfilade action Flanking or
oblique fire is especially effective when frontal fire is delivered
simultaneously against the same objective A convergent fire
forces the enemy to defend himself against attack from several
directions and creates a powerful moral as well as material
effect
Units seek to gain flanking fire by enveloping action
Flanking fire is also secured through the lateral echelonment
of supporting weapons with respect to the units they support
Heavy machine guns from positions in adjacent zones of
action deliver oblique fire over the troops in their front and
protect the flanks of troops in the attack echelon Light
machine guns of rifle units follow the leading elements
closely in order to take advantage of and deliver flanking fire
through the gaps along the front Units which have succeeded
in gaining advanced positions deliver flanking fire
across the front of adjacent rearward units
Lateral echelonment of artillery for purposes of flanking
fire increases the difficulties of fire control and of liaison between
the artillery and supported units The fire of supporting
artillery is more reliable and effective when its positions
and observation posts are in the zone of action of the supported
unit
538 The attacking echelon advances to assaulting distance
of the hostile position under its own and supporting
fires Until the main hostile resistance is broken attack
units advance by bounds to successive terrain lines on each

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
of which the fire support for the next bound is organized
Fire and movement are alternated in such manner that an
attack unit whose advance is made possible by the combined
fire of adjacent and supporting units moves forward to an
advanced position and by its fire from that position assists the
advance of the adjacent units
• 539 Troops transported by air may be employed to seize
hold or destroy objectives which contribute directly to the
success of the main attack
• 540 Artillery and other supporting weapons insure continuity
of support by displacing forward in groups (by
echelon) while the bulk remains in position and maintains
fire Fire is lifted successively to more distant targets as the
attacking echelon becomes endangered by it When supporting
artillery heavy machine-gun and mortar fires are lifted
from the hostile position to permit the attacking echelon to
close with the enemy the loss of this support must be compensated
for by the increased fire of the lighter weapons and
by the cooperative action of tanks (See ch 6 )
• 54 Artillery supports the attack through the depth of the
hostile position by successive concentrations in accordance
with the requests of the supported commanders Concentrations
of artillery fire are regulated to bring the greatest possible
volume of fire on objectives of decisive importance at the
critical moments of the attack Attack units take immediate
advantage of artillery fire effect to gain ground to the front
The artillery is prepared for early movement forward to maintain
close support as the attack progresses Essential fire
missions of units being displaced are distributed to units in
position
• 542 Artillery must employ all means at its disposal (observers
liaison sections airplanes wire and radio communication
to attack units) to obtain exact information of the loca;
tion of the front line The attacking units must cooperate
by employing all means of transmitting information to the
artillery (display of panels pyrotechnics and various other
means of signal communication) When uncertain as to the
location of the attack echelon direct support artillery takes
immediate steps to establish close contacts with those
elements
22
OPERATIONS
543-548
• 543 During the attack the supporting fires are concentrated
against the fronts where the attacking echelon is
making the greatest progress Artillery fires are supplemented
by fires of other supporting weapons The fire of these
weapons is used to increase the density of the artillery fire
or is placed on those areas and targets which can not be
effectively engaged by the artillery When the attack echelon
arrives close to the hostile position the fire of all artillery
including that in general support is concentrated on rearward
hostile defense areas
• 544 The primary purpose of close supporting fire is to
prevent the enemy from manning his defensive works in time
to meet the assault Its progression to successive objectives is
arranged between supporting and supported commanders
It may be regulated by a time schedule based upon the probable
rate of advance of the attacking troops by signal given by
assaulting troops or by a time schedule based upon a desirable
duration of the fire
Other fire is placed on critical points in the hostile position
to protect the attack echelon from hostile long-range and
flanking fires and from counterattack It is lifted to correspond
with the advance of the attacking echelon
• 545 Each attack unit uses the close supporting fires of its
artillery and other supporting weapons to close with the
enemy and to push on to its successive objectives without
deviating from the prescribed general direction of attack
• 546 Combat aviation supports the attack through the depth
of the hostile position Commanders of the supporting aviation
thoroughly familiarize themselves with the terrain in the
zone of the attack Supporting combat aviation is concentrated
over that part of the hostile front where the attack
seeks decisive results Its operations are coordinated to provide
the maximum support at the time the ground forces
launch the attack
• 547 The attack must not permit its advance to be long arrested
by hostile chemical concentrations Contaminated
terrain which cannot be avoided is posted and passed with
the protection of gas masks
•
548 Whether the main attack is based upon an envelopment
or a penetration the battle generally develops into local

548-55
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
conflicts along two opposing fronts During the course of
battle the combat action of units may undergo a change as
between envelopment and penetration A force that has successfully
enveloped the enemy's flank may have to make a
frontal attack to defeat a hostile reserve or may find a favorable
opportunity to attack the hostile resistance in flank
In a penetration once minor resistances have been overrun
the outflanking action of small units is the most effective
means of reducing the stronger hostile defense areas
• 549 An attack seldom is executed exactly as planned As
long as the enemy has any freedom of action unexpected difficulties
are encountered which culminate in a crisis The
approach of this critical phase of the attack must be recognized
by the commander so that timely measures can be
taken to shape the course of action to secure a favorable
outcome or to prevent a reverse (See pars 476-482 )
• 550 When the attacking echelon approaches assaulting distance
observation aviation is employed to observe especially
the situation of our own and the hostile advanced elements
Observers on this mission report to the division commander
and the commanders of infantry units the points where the
attack is stopped and those where penetrations have been
effected hostile counterattacks and other features of the
situation of our own and the hostile advanced elements
Other observers continue to inform higher commanders concerning
developments farther in rear of the battle front such
as shifting of hostile reserves arrival of reinforcements train
movements and the like From these reports and other
information commanders direct the movements of reserves
toward those portions of the hostile front that offer the greatest
prospects for decisive success and to support the attacking
troops in repulse of counterattacks Combat aviation is effectively
employed to attack enemy reserves and counterattacking
forces
8 55 In an attack of a stabilized front the approach has
already been effected and the attack opens with a coordinated
assault The hour of the assault is fixed by the commander
of the whole front from which the assault is to be launched
The exact day and hour is kept secret until the latest practicable
moment
24
OPERATIONS
552-554
• 552 On a stabilized front the period during which the opposing
forces have been in contact makes available more detailed
information of the enemy's defensive dispositions The
completeness of information will depend upon the length of
time the front has been stabilized and the efficiency of intelligence
measures Available information is augmented by
continuous reconnaissance Reconnaissance throughout preparation
for the attack is conducted in such manner that the
appearance of normal activity is maintained Information
is disseminated in the form of intelligence summaries maps
and air photographs
THE ASSAULT
• 553 Against a strong resistance and well-organized defense
the superior commander will prepare the assault of the
first hostile organized line of resistance by concentrating the
firepower of all supporting weapons including combat aviation
to neutralize the enemy and gear down his power of
resistance before launching the assault After the first onrush
a series of local assaults delivered by units of varying
strength on their own initiative continues the action Each
unit delivers its assault at the earliest moment that promises
success
The commander of the unit will have arranged to deliver
the assault on a time schedule or will notify the supporting
weapons by a prearranged signal that he is about to assault
The intensity of supporting fires is increased Under cover
of the supporting fire the assault unit advances close to its
objective When the supporting fires are lifted from the
objective the assault unit overruns the hostile resistance in a
single rush Any delay in launching the assault after the
fires lift allows the enemy to man his defenses
CONTINUATION OF THE ATTACK
554 After the assault of an organized position the attack
often breaks up into a series of eparate combats which are
continued throughout the depth of' the hostile position Th e
combats are directed by subordinate commanders within their
zones of action and are supported by all the means at their
disposal The first task is to capture assigned objectives
Resistances are reduced by fire or are outflanked
The utmost importance attaches to maintaining the continuity
and direction of the attack by the timely movement
25
554-557
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
and employment of reserves and by the timely displacement
of the artillery and other supporting weapons Reserves are
disposed behind points where the greatest progress is being
made to protect the flanks of the leading units and support
them in the repulse of counterattacks Artillery and air observers
search for probable assembly areas of hostile reserves
so that enemy preparation for counterattack may be broken
up by artillery fire and air attack If the attack is unable
to make further progress the captured terrain is organized
for defense and held until the attack can be continued
• 555 The enemy's reaction following the successful assault
of his main line of resistance road conditions and the possibility
of maintaining ammunition supply determine when
and in what strength the artillery will be moved into advanced
positions
Artillery executes its missions with the fewest possible
changes of position Frequent changes of position reduce
the volume of fire support The occupation of new positions
and renewal of fire require considerable time Nevertheless
change of position should unhesitatingly be made when fire
effect or deficiency in liaison with the attacking echelon requires
it Changes of position generally are effected by echelon
after timely reconnaissance of advanced position
Artillery promptly fires upon enemy troop assemblies troops
forming for counterattack and on any rearward position on
which the enemy attempts to reconstitute his defense
• 556 If the tide of battle turns against the enemy he may
endeavor to disengage his forces and renew the defense on
a rearward position or he may fight a delaying action until
battle can be renewed under conditions more favorable to
him Ordinarily the enemy will strive to hold out until nightfall
and effect his withdrawal under cover of darkness
Frequently the enemy will disclose his intentions to withdraw
Attacking troops must exercise great vigilance in observing
the conduct of the enemy in their front press their
attack with energy and maintain close contact' with him
Observation aviation searches the rear areas for indications
of retrograde movements of artillery and trains
a 557 If the enemy succeeds in withdrawing his major forces
from action the commander intensifies reconnaissance to
obtain the necessary information on which to decide what
26
OPERATIONS
557-56
line of action to follow Aggressive action may prevent the
enemy from reconstituting his defense on a rearward position
If the enemy succeeds in occupying a new position during
darkness a renewal of the attack in force mast be delayed
until daylight
It may be of great advantage to regroup the attack forces
during the advance to the new position and launch the main
attack on another part of the front Effort is made to exploit
the moral ascendency by a quick and powerful blow before
the enemy can reconstitute his defense The action of tanks
or armored forces and combat aviation at this time may be
decisive
• 558 If the enemy is fighting a delaying action on an extended
front the objective ordinarily will be attained more
quickly by concentrating on a decisive part of the front and
attacking with energy and dispatch An attack pushed deeply
and energetically through the hostile front will force the
enemy to an early evacuation of the whole front
∎ 559 In case of a break-through armored units penetrate
deeply into the hostile position and attack the enemy's reserves
artillery and command and signal communication
centers The gap is widened by attacking its flanks Other
mobile forces are sent through the gap to exploit the advantage
gained and to attack the enemy in rear and prevent his
escape The maximum efforts of combat aviation are concentrated
on supporting and cooperating with the forces
exploiting the break-through
560 When the attack does not reach its objective or does
not break through the hostile position during the day foot
troops intrench themselves at the points reached The night
is utilized to extend the advance Strong patrols with machine
guns are sent forward to occupy advanced positions
The foot troops advance and intrench in a new position under
the protection of these patrols Several advances of this character
may bring the troops within assaulting distance of the
hostile position These night advances must be coordinated
with the artillery and supporting combat aviation
RELIEF$ TO CONTINUE THE ATTACK
•
56 In offensive combat a relief may be necessary to
continue the momentum of the attack with fresh or more ex-

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
perienced troops; to change the direction of the attack or
to extend an envelopment ; or to initiate a strong offensive
on a front where stabilization has existed
• 562 When a relief is necessary warning orders are issued
by each commander (higher commander relieving unit and
unit to be relieved) to each of his subordinate units Warning
orders include : approximate hour the movement for the
relief is to begin ; zones in which relieving units are to operate
; and the restrictions imposed upon reconnaissance parties
as to size routes and hours of operation
• 563 Personal reconnaissance by the commander and staff
of the relieving unit and prior conference with the commander
and staff of the relieved unit are highly desirable
When neither is possible relieving units move forward to
attack without delay reconnoitering as they go As they
move forward commanders make every effort to locate commanders
of units to be relieved
564 A plan is formulated and orders are issued covering the
movement of relieving units Fundamentally the operation is
the same as the development of a command for combat In
the preparation of the plan restrictions imposed by higher
authority because of other trafflo in the zone of advance to
relief the greater road spaces that may be required because
of increased distances between units the road net and practicability
of cross-country movement must be considered
The plan must be flexible as to times and routes of movement
The size of the unit involved and the speed with which
the relief must be conducted will govern the thoroughness
with which the details of the plan are prepared
565 In accordance with the plan of the higher commander
commanders and staffs of both the relieving and relieved
units arrange and agree upon such details as guides use of
roads fire support to be furnished by the relieved unit security
measures which will be provided for the incoming
troops by the unit to be relieved transfer of the existing signal
communication system administrative matters and the
time command passes to the relieving unit
A 566 Units to be relieved furnish guides Guides meet the
relieving unit before it enters the area and conduct it to
assembly positions Whenever possible guides are furnished
for units down to and including the platoon
28
OPERATIONS
567-570
•
567 The plans for executing the relief must be in harmony
with the plans for continuing the attack
When the relief is executed in darkness troops relieved
are withdrawn promptly from the zone of action before the
attack is continued Artillery of the relieved unit (and frequently
other supporting weapons) may be held in position
to support the attack
When the relief is executed in daylight troops relieved
or passed through remain in position and continue the fire
support of the new unit until theix fires are masked and
until the attack has progressed far enough for the relieved
troops to be assembled and reorganized without urAue
casualties
• 568 If the exact location of forward elements to be relieved
is known and if relief is effected at night the line
of departure for the attack is the line held by the forward
elements When the exact location of the most advanced
elements of unit to be relieved is unknown the line of departure
must not be forward of the line held by most advanced
elements whose location is known In daylight and
terrain permitting a line of departure between the forward
elements to be relieved and a covered position close in their
rear may be better than a line coinciding with the frontline
elements
569 To disclose the fact that a relief is in progress invites
disaster-a heavy bombardment by air and artillery a counterattack
or both at a time when congestion and traffic
circulation are doubled
2 570 In reliefs on a scale large enough to require more than
a single night troops animals and vehicles of the relieving
unit are concealed during periods of visibility The
relief is carried out by echelon To prevent the discovery of
the relief through the capture of prisoners by the enemy
during an intervening day or night front-line elements are
relieved during the last night preceding the resumption of
the attack
When the relief is made in daylight woods fog and deiilade
are utilized in the approach Smoke is placed on hostile
observation posts and hostile forward elements Mobility
ruses feints and demonstrations are exploited
29
57 -575
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
57 During the course of the relief artillery maintains
its normal fires but is prepared to execute counterbattery
and protective fires along the front of the relief in the event
of a counterpreparation or of attack by the enemy
572 The principal task involved in a passage of lines is
the preparation for continuing the attack Therefore the
incoming commander must assume command of the zone of
action before his troops reach their attack positions
SECTION IV
ATTACK FROM THE DEFENSIVE
PLANNED DEFENSIVE-OFFENSIVE
573 A commander with an offensive mission may decide
to assume the defensive initially because of temporary combat
inferiority in numbers or dispositions or to create a
situation which will place the enemy at a tactical disadvantage
and offer opportunity for a decisive counteroffensive
In either case an early adoption of the offensive to attain
the objective is contemplated By inducing the enemy to
attack first the commander hopes to fix and exhaust him
and then when he is disorganized to launch the counteroffensive
This type of action demands the highest type of leadership
and tactical skill and troops with a high order of training
The major problem for the commander lies in timing the
attack
574 The selection occupation and organization of the
defensive position conform to the general doctrines discussed
in sections I and II chapter 0 except that organization of
the ground is not as complete as is required for a protracted
defense and a larger proportion of the close-combat elements
of the command are assembled concealed in a position favoring
the execution of the contemplated counteroffensive
∎ 575 Conduct of the defense conforms to the doctrine discussed
in section II chapter 0
As soon as the purpose of the initial defense has been accomplished
the counteroffensive is launched Thereafter
the conduct of the action is that of the attack
30
OPERATIONS
576-579
THE COUNTEROFFENSIVE
576 A defending force frequently has an opportunity to
adopt the offensive When a general counterattack launched
by the defender throws the attacker back following an apparently
successful advance or when a hostile attack breaks
down in front of the main line of resistance the enemy seldom
will be able to withstand a determined counteroffensive
The enemy artillery fire still may be superior but his attacking
echelon will be disorganized and signal communication
in his forward area will be disrupted If the defender seizes
the initiative and passes to an offensive before the attacker
can recover from his disorganization and can properly dispose
his reserves results often are decisive The defense must be
prepared to pass to the offensive and exploit the results of
successful defensive action
577 The general doctrines governing the preparation for
and conduct of an attack are applicable to the counteroffensive
SECTION V
PURSUIT
578 The pursuit is launched when the enemy is no longer
able to maintain his position and endeavors to escape by
retreat A commander recognizes success by the continued
advance of his troops in a decisive direction and the capture
of critical objectives ; by the number and morale of captured
prisoners ; by the number of abandoned weapons ; by the
numbers of hostile dead; by the diminution of hostile artillery
fire ; by the relaxation or cessation of hostile countermeasures
; and from reports that the enemy is withdrawing
579 When a commander recognizes that the enemy is
having difficulty in maintaining his position he utilizes all
means to maintain the continuity of the attack and exert a
relentless pressure on the defeated enemy
Effective pursuit requires leadership and exercise of initiative
to the highest degree in all echelons of command All
commanders in the attack echelon spur on their troops and
clinch the advantage with their reserves Pursuit of a defeated
enemy is pushed to the utmost limit of endurance of
troops animals and vehicles No opportunity is given him
to reorganize his forces and reconstitute his defense
3
580-584
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
0 580 The object of the pursuit is the annihilation of the
hostile forces This can seldom be accomplished by a straight
pushing back of the hostile forces on their lines of communication
Direct pressure against the retreating forces must be
combined with an enveloping or encircling maneuver to place
troops across the enemy's lines of retreat Encirclement of
both flanks of the retreating forces or of their separate elements
is attempted wherever conditions permit
By the coordinated employment of every available agency
of destruction and terrorization the shaken morale of the
defeated enemy is converted into panic The incipient dissolution
of his organization is transformed into rout
0 58 In anticipation of the time for launching the pursuit
the commander causes preparatory measures to be taken
These measures include necessary plans and orders in all
echelons Reserves are regrouped Artillery and other necessary
units are attached to the direct pressure forces for
the pursuit Distant objectives are assigned to the principal
tactical groupings Missions are assigned to combat aviation
and to the artillery in general support to obstruct movement
on hostile avenues of withdrawal Preparations are made
for launching one or more forces of great mobility in encircling
maneuvers to strike the enemy in flank and rear and
cut off his retreat General reserves are especially appropriate
for this mission (See par 507 )
• 582 The pursuit is conducted on a broad front Motor
transportation is employed to expedite the movement of foot
troops
Troops before whom the enemy is giving way send in their
reserves to gain his flank and rear or break through his covering
troops
• 583 The forces engaged in the direct pressure and in the
encircling maneuvers are assigned directions zones of action
and objectives designed to bring the pursuit to a decisive conclusion
Such directions and zones of action may be around
the flanks or through the wider gaps which defeat has opened
in the hostile dispositions or may be a continuation of the
existing zones of action
• 584 Supporting combat aviation concentrates on lines of
communication centers in the enemy's rear area on hostile
columns in retreat and on hostile reserves endeavoring to
32
OPERATIONS
584-587
reconstitute the defense It blocks defiles on the enemy's
line of retreat and disrupts traffic on the main roads and
railroads in the enemy's rear area
Observation aviation reconnoiters the roads in the enemy's
zone of retreat to keep contact with retreating columns
and to locate any movement of hostile reinforcements and
keeps ground commanders informed of the hostile activities
and movement within their zones of action
0 585 The employment of artillery is based upon the maximum
exploitation of the mobility of lighter pieces and the long
range of the heavier types So long as the withdrawing enemy
can be engaged with observed and planned fire a portion of
the artillery remains in position to fire on the more distant
targets Long-range artillery working with observation aviation
and balloons continues its fire on the enemy lines of
communication up to the limit of its range
The artillery attached to the pursuing forces in addition
to its supporting action fires on hostile elements attempting
to form columns in rear of the enemy's covering troops and
gradually takes over the missions of the artillery remaining
in position
0 586 The purpose of the encircling maneuver is to get in
rear of the defeated enemy and halt his retreat so that he
may be destroyed between the direct pressure and encircling
forces
When practicable mobile forces in the encircling maneuvers
advance along roads paralleling the enemy's line of retreat
to cut him off at defiles bridges and other critical points
When the encircling forces cannot outdistance the enemy
they push through to a critical locality and engage the enemy's
main forces in flank
Combat aviation ; armored mechanized and motorized
units ; and cavalry are employed in the encircling maneuvers
Troops transported by air for employment at critical defiles
deep in the hostile rear pending the arrival of more powerful
mobile encircling forces may contribute decisively to a successful
pursuit
587 The advance in the decisive direction must be maintained
Hostile rear guards or forces on flank positions must
not turn pursuing forces from the decisive direction Every
effort must be made to block the main hostile force When
33
587-590
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
necessary a new encircling force to continue the pursuit is
constituted
When the enemy succeeds in establishing himself in a position
from which he cannot be dislodged quickly the superior
commander takes prompt measures to coordinate the attack
again supporting it with all available means (See pars
557 and 558 )
0 588 The enemy's attempts to organize his retreat under
the cover of darkness must be frustrated Under no circumstances
must he be allowed to break contact Units which
have advanced without serious opposition continue their
march during the night Other units organize successive
limited attacks against the enemy in their front
During a night pursuit the leading detachments push their
advance along all available roads followed by the main pursuing
forces ' The attached artillery advances by echelon
going into successive positions from which it can interdict
the enemy's routes of retreat by map firing or by fire directed
by observers which accompany the leading detachments
Prompt report is made when objectives are reached so that
artillery fires may be coordinated
The effect of artillery fire is complemented by combat aviation
which searches enemy routes of retreat with flares and
bombs enemy columns and critical points in the enemy's rear
area
• 589 Pursuit requires extensive reliance upon radio for
communication with the leading troops The importance
attached to hostile interception of radio communication in
other situations does not obtain in equal degree in pursuit
Effort is made to intercept the enemy's radio messages The
construction of wire lines is concentrated along the more important
axes Command posts or advance message centers
are established close behind the leading troops
• 590 Adequate provision for the supply of ammunition and
motor fuel to the pursuing troops is essential to the success
of the pursuit The commander must relieve the pursuing
columns of all worries concerning supply and evacuation

SECTION VI
SECURITY IN THE Or r aNSIVE
• 59 Success or failure of an offensive is dependent in a
large measure upon the action taken to protect the command
from hostile reaction Open flanks are highly vulnerable
The best security is to keep the enemy so heavily
involved that he has no time or means available to endanger
the success of the attack Security of attack forces is assured
by a timely search for information in all directions from
which a hostile threat may come by the proper disposition
of security forces of ample mobility and combat power and
by prompt dispatch of accurate information and orders to
security forces This is particularly true in security against
hostile forces of great mobility such as air tank motorized
and cavalry units In offensive operations the service of
security is performed in accordance with the general doctrines
discussed in chapter 6
• 59Z In offensive operations the mass of available means
for defense against air and mechanized attack is disposed
to favor the main attack The combat means for defense
against air attack are supplemented by utilization of cover
defilade dispersion and night movements to the maximum
The combat means for defense against attack by tanks or
other mechanized forces are supplemented by utilization of
natural and artificial obstacles to protect the flanks and rear
of the command by dispersion and by night movements
(See chs 6 and 0 )
• 593 Antitank guns in each echelon of troops are disposed
to cover the most likely avenues of approach of hostile
mechanized units ; the bulk of the antitank guns are held
mobile prepared to meet a hostile mechanized attack at any
point Protection against mechanized attack is best assured
by meeting the attack with the combined action of tanks
and mobile antitank guns supported by every available and
effective means of fire support to isolate and destroy the
hostile mechanized forces
• 594 In offensive operations the greatest need for security
exists during critical phases of the battle Security is enhanced
by meeting possible threats with heavy fire before
they can develop The action of combat aviation against
45
594-596
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
highly mobile threats and against close less mobile threats
is particularly effective especially if hostile troops or vehicles
are in close formation
SECTION VII
TERMINATION OF OFFENSIVE ACTION
• 595 An offensive action once begun is halted only by hostile
reaction or by other elements in the situation which
demand it
If during the course of an attack it becomes necessary
to pass to the defensive the leading foot elements intrench
themselves on the ground then held The leading echelon
then is thinned out and forces are redistributed to organize
the defense in depth It may be necessary to move some elements
to the front or rear for short distances to establish
the defense on favorable terrain and secure flanking fire
Any major adjustments attempted in daylight will probably
result in heavy casualties The general position of attacking
units is maintained until darkness when the selected
defensive position is occupied and organized as described in
chapter 0
If the situation demands major adjustments in daylight
they are accomplished under protection of fog or smoke and
of a maximum of fire support by artillery combat aviation
and other supporting weapons
• 596 If during the course of an attack it becomes necessary
to break off the action and withdraw the command
initially passes to the defensive The completeness of the
defense is dependent upon the situation and whether the
initial defensive and the withdrawal must be executed in
daylight or darkness Thereafter the withdrawal is executed
according to the doctrines discussed in chanter

CHAPTER 0
THE DEFENSIVE
SECTION I
ORGANIZATION FOR DEFENSE
GENERAL
0 597 The general object of defensive combat is to gain time
pending the development of more favorable conditions for
undertaking the offensive or to economize forces on one front
for the purpose of concentrating superior forces for a decision
elgewhere
Under the first of these objects a commander may assume
the defensive pending the arrival of reinforcements or he
may be thrown on the defensive by inferiority in numbers
disposition or training He may take up a defensive position
and invite attack as part of a deliberate plan to win the battle
by a counteroffensive
Under the second object the defensive is usually expressed
in the mission received from higher authority This mission
may be to hold a vital area pending completion of the maneuver
of other forces to protect a flank or to contain an
enemy force while an offensive is being conducted on another
part of the front or in another theater
• 598 Our defensive doctrine contemplates the organization
of a battle position to be held at all costs and the use of
covering forces to delay and disorganize the advance of the
enemy and to deceive him as to the true location of the battle
position (See par 6 0 )
RECONNAISSANCE AND SELECTION OF POSITION

599 The mission 'the situation and the terrain limit the
choice of localities where the defense may be offered
Commanders of large units usually determine the general
location of the battle position from the map
The position on which battle is offered must conform to the
object of the defense and should facilitate future maneuver
without jeopardizing the success of the defense It must

force the enemy to a direct attack or a time-consuming
maneuver as a position that can be readily avoided has no
defensive value A flank position must draw the enemy from
his original direction of advance
• 600 Reconnaissance of the position is as detailed as the
situation permits It includes a study of the principal routes
of hostile approach terrain available for hostile observation
and the corridors most advantageous to the hostile attack A
Study of the terrain in which the enemy must carry out his
attack will give valuable indications of his possible assembly
positions the location of his artillery the terrain favorable
for attack by his mechanized forces and the area most
advantageous for his main attack
• 60 If contact with the enemy has not been made the commander
ordinarily is free to make a detailed reconnaissance
o position select the terrain on which to defend and decide
on the best distribution of troops In this case the command
usually is developed into an assembly position preliminary to
deployment for defense
• 602 Basing his action on his mission his personal reconnaissance
the reconnaissance reports of his subordinates and
the available information of the enemy and friendly troops
the commander forms an estimate of the enemy's capabilities
and the probable front of hostile attack and makes his decision
regarding the location of the main line of resistance
and the regimental reserve line the employment of the
artillery the assignment of sectors the strength and location
of the general reserve the antimechanized defenses and other
measures necessary for security Successive reconnaissances
by lower commanders fix on the ground the distribution of
smaller units and the location of their combat emplacements
Exact information as to the trace of the main line of resistance
is furnished to the artillery
0 603 In the hasty assumption of the defensive from a
march formation reconnaissance usually must be curtailed
and the defense assumed directly from the development
Depending on the mission and the situation it may be
advisable for a commander initially to attack to seize terrain
to his front on which to organize the battle position In
other situations he may employ a covering force organizing
the battle position on terrain in rear

• 604 Continuous reconnaissance and observation of the
enemy's dispositions are conducted to secure the earliest possible
indications of the enemy's offensive preparations Air
reconnaissance provides the information concerning the situation
in rear of the enemy's leading elements
• 605 The character of the terrain exercises a decisive influence
on the selection of position Ridges and valleys generally
parallel to the front of advance constitute obstacles to
the progress of an offensive and are natural lines of resistance
for the defense Such ridges often afford observation and
fields of fire favorable for a defense in depth
Natural obstacles (e g river lines woods swamps) are
important factors for consideration especially if the situation
requires that protective measures be taken against mechanized
units or other mobile forces such as horse cavalry or
motorized units
Commanding elevations and ridges delimit the compartments
of terrain and form the framework of the system of
observation command and fire control in combat They
determine directly the location of the observation posts and
positions of the artillery and other supporting weapons and
indirectly the location of defensive and assembly positions
As a general rule long gentle slopes afford better conditions
for defense than abrupt elevations However positions along
commanding heights are suited for delaying action
0 606 The battle position is so selected as to use the terrain
to the greatest advantage The extent of the position must
be appropriate to the available troops
The most important terrain factors are-adequate artillery
observation good fields of fire concealment from hostile observation
and the presence of natural obstacles The relative
importance of these terrain factors depends upon the
strength composition armament and mission of the defending
force together with aa consideration of the enemy's
capabilities
In selecting the forward limit of the battle position the
defender seeks terrain which will permit the most effective
employment of the fires of artillery and other weapons Clear
fields of fire for small arms are important and usually lead
to its location on a forward slope Consideration of concealment
may however make it desirable to select a reverse slope
606-608
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
Such a location is practicable when possession of the crest to
the front is not essential to the observation of artillery fire
When the forward limit of the position is on the forward
slope the defense areas of front-line battalions may be extended
to the rear to include the reverse slope When it is
located on the reverse slope front-line battalions establish
strong detachments from their reserves on the forward crest
to fire on attacking troops during their approach to the
position
Observation to the limit of range of the weapons is desired
in front of the main line of resistance as welt as within the
battle position Adequate observation posts for artillery are
essential The battle position must be so located that the
essential observation will be retained even though the enemy
succeeds in penetrating into the position
Maximum advantage is taken of natural and artificial
obstacles to stop attack by mechanized units or limit the
directions of their movement Towns villages and cities
have considerable defensive strength against mechanized
attack They are however vulnerable to air attack especially
by incendiary bombs
® 607 All parts of a position will not have the same defensive
strength Avenues of approach which enable the attacker
to reach the position under concealment or cover are sources
of weakness These avenues of approach may however be
unsuited for enemy tank attacks Clear fields of fire over
which the enemy must advance for some distance under the
defender's fire are sources of strength in a defense against
foot troops but may furnish excellent terrain for hostile
mechanized attack The defender must be prepared to meet
that form of attack which the terrain favors
608 A position combining all defensive advantages will
seldom be available The weak points of a position are
strengthened A short field of frontal fire is compensated by
dense flanking fires and heavy mortar and artillery concentrations
; exposure to hostile observation by distribution in
depth and construction of dummy works and masks; deficient
observation by increased strength of local garrisons Persistent
chemicals demolitions and mines can be used effectively
to strengthen exposed flanks and to contaminate and
block covered avenues of approach leading Into the position

609-6
i 609 The defense no less than the offense must effect
surprise The visible lines of a defensive system must not
betray the defensive dispositions They should mask the real
defensive organization Every available means must be employed
not only to mislead the attacker as to the location
of the position but also as to the strength and disposition of
the defending force Deception delay and security are obtained
through the use of covering detachments
TACTICAL ORGANIZATION
∎ 6 0 The defense is built around a series a tactical localities
the retention of which will insure the integrity of the
position A battle position comprises a zone of resistance
consisting of a number of mutually supporting defense areas
disposed irregularly in width and in depth each organized for
all around defense with trenches obstacles and emplacements
Tactical unity is maintained in each defensive area
A line joining the forward edge of the most advanced
organized defense areas is called the main line of resistance
It is the line in front of which all elements of the defense
must be able to concentrate their fire to break up the hostile
attack The contour of the main line of resistance is thus
irregular in trace with elements on it sited for frontal and
flanking fire A line designated to coordinate the locations
and actions of the regimental reserves in the battle position
is called the regimental reserve line
∎ 6 Between the main line of resistance and the regimental
reserve line company supports and battalion reserves
organize the ground The distance between successive echelons
on the battle position (units on the main line of resistance
company supports battalion reserves and regimental
reserves) should not exceed the effective range of small-arms
fire It should however be sufficiently great to prevent any
echelon from falling Into the zone of dispersion of artillery
fire directed against a more advanced echelon This distribution
in depth diminishes the effect of hostile fire and provides
for continuity in' defensive fires -and movement against the
enemy even though he succeeds in penetrating into the battle
position

6 2-6 5
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
• 6 2 The natural defensive strength of the position has a
direct bearing upon the distribution of troops for its defense
both as to frontage and depth Portions of the front which
have great defensive strength can be held with fewer men
or units can be assigned wider sectors while the reverse is
true in weak portions of the front There is thus a variation
in the troops which can be made available for reserves Close
terrain and exhausted troops require a greater density of
troops forward toward the main line of resistance
• 6 3 The width of sectors assigned to infantry units varies
with the natural defensive strength of the various parts of
the position the relative importance of the sectors the degree
of control required and the number and strength of units
available The necessity for control and the character of
fields of fire affect the intervals which may be permitted between
tactical localities Some variation in the width of sectors
may arise from the necessity for adjusting them to fix
responsibility for defense of terrain corridors By adaptation
of the width of sectors to their natural strength there results
an economy of force which enables the commander to hold out
the maximum strength for use as reserves
• 6 4 Sectors are delimited in orders by boundaries-lines
indicated on the map or ground extending from rear to front
Boundaries are located so that there will be no question of
the responsibility for the defense of the key terrain which
dominates a critical avenue of hostile approach While it is
frequently impossible to include both the avenue of hostile
approach and the adjacent dominating terrain in the sector
of the small units the boundaries of sectors assigned to battalion
and larger units should be located to insure unity of
defensive dispositions and fires in defense of these critical
localities
Boundaries are extended forward of the battle position to
the limit of the range of the weapons with which the unit
is equipped Boundaries may be extended forward to include
the outpost line in order to delineate the outpost responsibility
of units on the battle position The extension' of boundaries
to the rear is influenced largely by the existing road net
and routes for movement within the position
•
6 5 The division commander determines the distribution
of the division artillery and its subdivision for combat (direct
42
OPERATIONS
6 5-6 8
and general support) Since the rapid concentration of artillery
fire on important objectives is essential to a successful
defense when the situation permits control of the artillery
under the direction of the division commander is preferable
Every effort is made to meet the hostile main attack with the
mass of the artillery fire
The echelonment in depth of the artillery takes into consideration
the range of the various weapons the location of
the targets and the possibilities of neutralization by hostile
counterbattery fire The echelonment is limited by the considerations
that the entire artillery must be able to concentrate
its fire in close support of the main line of resistance
that the foremost echelon can fire deep in the hostile zone
and that the rearmost can support the rear defense areas of
the battle position
• 6 6 The battle position is protected by outposts whose
mission is to provide time for the main force to prepare itself
for combat to deceive the enemy as to the location of the
battle position to force early development by the enemy
and to provide a deeper view within the terrain over which
the attacker will advance
Whenever practicable the outposts are located at sufficient
distance from the main line of resistance to prevent the occupying
forces from being taken under observed fire by hostile
light artillery Outposts will ordinarily not be established beyond
the effective range of the light artillery of the battle
position
The outpost line of resistance and the ground between the
outpost and the battle position are organized for delaying
action to the extent permitted by the time and labor available
• 6 7 When forced to withdraw under hostile pressure the
outposts conduct a delaying action Every effort is made
to deceive the enemy as to the exact location of the battle
position The withdrawal of the outposts must be so arranged
that they neither will interfere with nor be endangered
by the fire from the main position Coordination is
facilitated by the use of prearranged signals and previously
designated routes of withdrawal
• 6 8 Whenever practicable an advanced covering force is
employed in front of the outpost The mission of this covering
force is to inflict the maximum delay on the enemy to
43
6 8-624
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
permit the defender to utilize advanced artillery observation
to permit the laying of mines demolitions and obstacles in
front of the outpost and the battle position and to deceive
the enemy as to the actual location of the battle position
Similarly such forces may be employed on exposed flanks
6 9 Natural terrain obstacles such as water courses heavily
wooded areas and swamps are particularly favorable
areas for the operations of advanced covering forces
The initial position of the advanced covering force and
the terrain between this force and the outpost are organized
to the extent practicable in the time available
620 The advanced covering force should be mobile The
use of cavalry mechanized and motorized troops and engineers
is indicated It should have strong artillery and antitank
support Organic artillery may be reinforced by artillery
from the main force temporarily emplaced in advance of
the battle position
∎ 62 The advanced covering force fights delaying action in
its withdrawal It avoids serious engagement with the enemy
622 The direction from which the main attack may be expected
and the commander's plan of maneuver determine the
initial location of the reserve According to circumstances
it is echeloned for protective purposes in rear of an exposed
flank held in a position in readiness from which it can deliver
a prepared counterattack or so disposed that it can
launch the counteroffensive by striking a hostile attack in
flank
623 Large horse cavalry units should rarely be called on to
defend a position Cavalry seeks to accomplish defensive missions
by delaying action or by defensive-offensive tactics
When required to defend in position it operates in general
as does infantry
624 Corps and division cavalry is employed on reconnaissance
missions with especial attention to locating the mass of
the hostile force It may be reinforced by motorized 'infantry
artillery and engineers and employed as a mobile covering
detachment (See par 598 ) During battle it continues
reconnaissance and security missions especially to the flanks
It may he held in mobile reserve or used to harass enemy
flanks and rear when the situation permits
44
OPERATIONS
625-628
625 Mechanized units are not normally employed to hold
defensive positions They may 'however be employed well
forward supported by combat aviation to cover the occupation
of a position by other troops They employ delaying
action to accomplish this mission (See ch ) Should the
situation demand it they may be required to hold an area
pending the arrival of other troops In performing such a
task they operate similarly to horse cavalry except that
larger reserves are withheld initially for the purpose of
counterattack When supporting infantry they constitute a
powerful striking force and are held initially in reserve prepared
for rapid entry into combat when an opportunity for
a counterblow is presented
626 General reserves may be called upon to relieve units
on the battle position participate in a major counterattack or
counteroffensive extend the flanks of the battle position or
occupy a rear position
Prior to commitment to a definite line of action they are
held mobile prepared to participate in battle in accordance
with the plan of maneuver of the superior commander While
so held they are disposed for all around defense against
attack by hostile mechanized forces which may succeed in
passing through or around the battle position Necessary
measures are taken for' protection against hostile aircraft
and for countering an attack by troops transported by air
ORGANIZATION OF FIRE
627 Coordination of the fire of the infantry artillery
antitank antiaircraft and other weapons is carefully planned
and expressed in orders Plans provide for bringing the
enemy under effective fire as early as practicable unless the
situation requires that fire be withheld to obtain surprise
and for so regulating the intensity of the fire that the enemy
is subjected to progressively heavier fire as he approaches
the defensive position
628 The organization of systematic flanking fire by machine
guns supplemented by other small arms constitutes the
basis of defensive dispositions Adjacent units in addition to
defending their own fronts mutually cover one another's
fronts with flanking fire Dead spaces in bands of machinegun
fire are covered by the fire of other weapons Fire effect
45
628-630
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
is increased by obstacles which hold the enemy under frontal
and flanking fire Sectors of the defensive position especially
exposed to hostile fire may be left unoccupied except at night
and during periods of low visibility and defended by flanking
fire from adjacent sectors
Machine guns are distributed in width and depth in each
battalion defensive area to take full advantage of terrain
As far as practicable their fire should cover the entire front
of the main line of resistance with continuous bands of fire
Some machine guns are sited to take under flanking fire
hostile elements which succeed in penetrating the main line
of resistance Some of the heavy machine guns are located
where they can develop long range fire during the hostile approach
without disclosing the location of the main line of
resistance
Artillery fire is coordinated in the defensive plan of fire and
is especially concentrated on the critical localities and on
ground which is dead to or beyond the range of the fire of
other supporting weapons The effective control of this fire
requires good observation and efficient signal communication
0 629 All possible measures are taken to insure security
against mechanized attack Antimechanized defense is organized
throughout the depth of the position The main effort
is made in areas which are favorable to the employment of
mechanized forces Battalion and regimental antitank guns
from concealed positions defend the forward part of the
battle position while antitank weapons of higher units are
echeloned farther in rear Positions and routes for these
weapons are reconnoitered and the guns are held in readiness
prepared for rapid movement to any threatened part of the
front (See also ch 6 and sec V ch 0 )
Through a judicious combination of antitank weapons and
obstacles aided by artillery fire combat aviation and tanks
attacks by mechanized forces are broken up and halted as
soon as they are disclosed
2 630 The division artillery commander prepares the general
plans for the employment of artillery in accordance with instructions
of the division commander Coordination between
artillery fires and those of other weapons is essential It is
effected principally through liaison between artillery units
and the units they are designated to support The close sup-

630-633
47
port of the main line of resistance is a governing consideration
in the formulation of all artillery plans
• 63 The artillery plan of fire is based primarily upon the
execution of a counterpreparation to break up or cripple the
hostile attack before it can be launched Fire is not opened
by the mass of the artillery until targets of sufficient importance
are disclosed
It is important to take hostile artillery under fire at an
early moment to interdict hostile routes of approach and to
dislocate the hostile system of command and fire control
The artillery of the attacker is most vulnerable from the
moment it comes within range of the defender's artillery
until it has completed its deployment During this period it
constitutes one of the principal targets of the defender's
artillery fire and aviation The fire of all available artillery
is concentrated to cripple the hostile artillery before it can
get into action Counterbattery continues to be the principal
mission of a portion of the artillery especially the medium
artillery throughout the battle
The corps gives the division instructions regulating the
employment of the division artillery in the execution of its
more distant missions The corps reinforces the action of
the division artillery and extends its sector of fire in depth by
the use of the artillery at its disposal Long-range destruction
and interdiction fire is directed especially on sensitive
points in the enemy's rear areas and on his lines of communication
(bridges crossroads and supply establishments)
• 632 Combat aviation extends in depth and reinforces the
fire of the artillery Air attack against hostile ammunition
and other supply establishments airdromes railroad installations
and bridges have important effects in delaying or dislocating
the hostile preparations for attack Other remunerative
targets for combat aviation are enemy columns artillery
in position reserves and mechanized forces
•
633 Antiaircraft artillery is disposed initially to protect
the organization and occupation of the battle position
When the commander has determined on what front the
enemy is making his main attack the antiaircraft artillery
concentrates its efforts cn preventing air observation and
attack on the threatened parts of the defensive position and
on protecting the employment of reserves for counterattack
633-635
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
If sufficient antiaircraft 'artillery is available some units
are assigned to the defense of important roads and installations
(railheads ammunition establishments and airdromes)
The antiaircraft intelligence service gives prompt warning of
the approach of hostile aircraft to all units concerned (See
par 67 )
Antiaircraft artillery weapons are sited so they may be
employed against attack by mechanized vehicles when this
can be done without interference with their normal missions
In the event of simultaneous attack from hostile aircraft and
mechanized vehicles fire must be concentrated against the
more dangerous threat
ORGANIZATION OF THE GROUND
634 The organization of a position is limited only by the
time and facilities available Protection is to be sought in
the distribution of defenses In depth and in width their
adaptation to the terrain concealment from hostile observation
and in the strength of construction From the beginning
great care Is taken to conceal the most important works by
camouflage or natural terrain features Measures for increasing
the effect of fire and for providing adequate signal communication
take precedence over the construction of field
fortification
∎ 635 Troops carry out the organization of the position
in accordance with a plan of construction expressed in orders
in the form of priorities After the location of combat emplacements
has been fixed priority is given to clearing the
field of fire to removal of objects masking our own observation
and to the determination of ranges to points In the foreground
Primary consideration should be given to provisions
for camouflaging the works to be constructed These measures
are followed ordinarily by the construction of the various
defensive works and obstacles and by the preparation of
routes of approach for reserves and for ammunition supply
Work may proceed simultaneously on several items
Artillery and heavy weapons units give priority 'to the construction
of observation and command posts and signal communication
systems and provision for the supply of ammunition
Shelter is constructed for personnel and provision is
made for camouflage of ammunition dumps and the protec-
48
OPERATIONS
635-640
tion of ammunition against the weather For the protection
of guns more reliance is placed upon camouflage and provision
for alternate positions than upon the fortification of
gun emplacements
• 636 In the construction of obstacles wire entanglements
are sited so that their outer edges can be swept by flanking
fire Other obstacles are coordinated with demolitions All
obstacles are covered by fire to hinder their removal They
should be concealed from hostile observation
• 637 Dummy works serve to mislead the enemy and disperse
his fire To be effective they must closely resemble
genuine works ; dummy works easily recognizable as such give
the enemy valuable negative information They must bear
evidence of an attempt at camouflage
• 638 Channels of signal communication are increased and
alternate channels provided Units are connected by wire
lines not only with the rear but also laterally ; the importance
of lateral lines consists not only in affording direct signal
communication between adjacent units but also in making
available numerous alternative channels of signal communication
between advanced units and the rear Alternate
command posts are selected and organized
• 639 Engineers are employed to impede the advance of the
enemy by the execution of demolitions and by the creation
of a zone of obstacles including mine fields When necessary
they defend the demolitions and obstacles which they
construct They increase the defensive powers of the other
arms by the construction of field works requiring special equipment
or training by technical assistance in other works of
organization of the ground and by furnishing them with
the necessary tools and engineer supplies
They may also be employed in the siting or preparation of
rear positions In emergencies they may participate in the
defense as Infantry
• 640 The activities of the chemical troops and engineers
are closely coordinated Persistent chemicals if to be used
have especial defensive value by reason of the fact that concentrations
established before the hostile attack retain their
effectiveness during the course of the attack Barriers of
persistent chemicals are placed to protect portions of the
49
640-643
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
front and flanks of the position and to cover defiles vital
roads road junctions and wooded stream lines across or along
favorable routes of hostile approach When these barriers
qan be placed without hostile interference persistent chemical
mines are employed ; when the area is controlled by the
enemy aviation artillery or chemical mortars are used In
deciding to use persistent chemicals the commander must
carefully evaluate its effect on his contemplated future operations
• 64 The selection of a rear position at such distance from
the'main position that the attacker cannot direct the fire
of his artillery upon it without displacing his batteries facilitates
the conduct of a flexible defense The extent of its organization
will depend upon the situation and the time available
The forces employed in the construction of the rear
position must not be obtained at the risk of jeopardizing the
defense of the main battle position
• 642 The development of a hastily occupied defensive position
into a more strongly fortified defensive system is dependent
upon the situation and the time and material available
for construction This may take place on a front which
has stabilized after an indecisive battle or is out of contact
with the enemy
• 643 The development of such a defensive position aims
first of all to strengthen the main line of resistance battery
positions and the command and control facilities of the
entire position The means employed include numerous
communication trenches; obstacles including tank barriers
and mines; shelter for troops ; observation and command
posts including alternate locations ; signal communication ;
gun positions ; and supply dumps These works differ from
those in mobile situations in the elaborateness and permanency
of their construction In areas of resistance in rear
of the main line of resistance permanent works are constructed
to limit hostile penetration All works are concealed
or camouflaged
In the siting of emplacements for defending troops extreme
care must be taken that there are no undefended
approaches from any direction that would permit hostile
elements to work their way in close enough to destroy the
occupants with hand grenades or other close-combat weap-
50
OPERATIONS
643-648
ons Provision must be made for protecting the rear against
attack by troops transported by air and by highly mobile
forces
∎ 644 Communication trenches greatly facilitate the exercise
of command the movement of troops and the functioning
of supply In moving situations time will rarely be available
for the complete construction and camouflage of such
trenches They are indispensable in the prolonged occupation
of a position They are first constructed over exposed
stretches on the routes of approach from the rear ; their
entrances are conspicuously marked As a general rule communication
trenches should not be employed as combat
emplacements They should be so sited that they will not
indicate to the enemy the location of combat emplacements
Their use however as part of a switch position in case
the main line of resistance becomes untenable should be'
considered
5 645 The nature of overhead cover varies with the location
of the troops to be sheltered The only forms of protection
having permanent value against fire are dugouts and concrete
or steel shelters sufficiently resistant to withstand highpowered
artillery fire and bombs from the air Deep dugouts
in the front lines do not permit the prompt egress of troops
and in case of attack may become traps Overhead cover for
front-line troops is designed chiefly to afford splinter-proof
protection and shelter from the weather Lack of strength is
compensated for as far as possible by the increased number
and smaller size of the shelters
• 646 Overhead cover is an essential means of conserving the
fighting capacity of the troops in the prolonged occupation
of a position
Reserves within range of hostile artillery fire and subject to
the attack of combat aviation are as far as practicable
sheltered in bombproof dugouts
• 647 In a stabilized situation the problem of drainage assumes
great importance ; the siting of works with a view to
effective drainage is always given due consideration
• 648 In addition to the depots of large units small dumps
of ammunition rations and materials needed in the construction
and defense of the position are established in the sectors
of small units
5
649-652
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
• 649 The priority of work in the development of a position
which is out of contact with the enemy is determined
largely by the time required for the construction of the essential
works and the extent to which they lend themselves to
camouflage Provision must be made for camouflage before
the work is begun Camouflage is then carried on continuously
throughout the work
After reconnaissance and determination of the method of
occupation of the position command posts observation posts
signal communication facilities obstacles and shelters for
the troops are constructed Adequate forces must be concentrated
early on important works requiring a considerable
period for their construction To avoid disclosing the position
the construction of fire and communication trenches
may be deferred until troops occupy the position
SECTION II
CONDUCT OF THE DEFENSE
• 650 The defense is conducted along mobile lines Mobility
is obtained by the use of covering forces by improving facilities
for movement within the battle position by distribution
of forces in depth and by holding out reserves capable
of rapid movement Covering forces delay deceive and disorganize
the enemy ; units in organized areas of the battle
position hold their positions at all costs ; reserves maneuver
behind the pivots thus established Mobile and rigid defense
are so combined that possession is retained of the areas
essential to the maneuver of the defensive forces the maximum
forces are made available for counterattack or counteroffensive
purposes and the enemy is deceived as to the
character of the resistance with which he is confronted
• 65 The conduct of the defense must be aggressive It
must be prepared to take advantage of errors or failures on
the part of the enemy The counterattack is the decisive element
of defensive action It is seldom feasible to hold a defensive
position by passive resistance only
652 The integrity of the battle position is maintained by a
combination of fighting in place and counterattack
Regardless of the considerations which dictated the adoption
of a defensive attitude the tactics of defensive combat are
essentially to develop the maximum firepower against an
52
OPERATIONS
652-656
advancing enemy to reduce our own losses by a better knowledge
and utilization of the terrain and thereby to stop the
enemy's advance or throw him back by counterattack
653 In order to maintain itself in action in the face of
hostile superiority the artillery must fully exploit its mobility
If there are indications that the location of certain
batteries has been discovered such batteries effect a change
to one of their alternative or supplementary positions
In quiet periods artillery units assigned to counterbattery
and harassing missions may be moved to previously surveyed
positions for the delivery of fire This movement occupation
of position delivery of fire and return to position are generally
accomplished during hours of darkness
• 654 When the imminence of the hostile attack is discovered
counterpreparation fires are directed upon the hostile
attack formations artillery and command observation and
signal communication systems to break up the attack before
it starts A general counterpreparation involving all of the
artillery with the command is fired on the order of the superior
commander Local counterpreparations designed to
cover only the points threatened by a local attack are fired
on the order of subordinate commanders
• 655 If the enemy succeeds in launching his attack in spite
of the counterpreparation the artillery seeks to keep him
under fire in considerable depth by placing defensive concentrations
on his advancing attack echelons and on his reserves
and by continuing counterbattery fire These fires are delivered
on the request of supported unit commanders or
of observers following the progress of the attack with air
or ground observation
• 656 Finally defensive concentrations and barrages are
fired close to our troops They strengthen the fire of other
weapons covering the most dangerous avenues of approach
to the positions Barrages generally are delivered on pyrotechnic
signal from the front-line troops but may be executed
on report from artillery observers that the hostile attack
is threatening the integrity of the position
Since a uniform distribution of artillery fire along the entire
front is generally ineffective plans for the delivery of concentrations
and barrages are designed to provide fire on

critical areas or fronts These fires especially the barrages
are delivered at a high rate and involve a great expenditure
of ammunition Hence it is essential that front-line units
carefully consider the emergency in their calls for artillery
support
Provision should be made for reinforcing counterpreparation
and barrage fires by artillery normally assigned to other
missions or by the artillery of adjacent divisions
• 657 In addition to the artillery other supporting weapons
participate in counterpreparation and barrage fires Their
fires are coordinated with those of the artillery in the plan
of defense
• 658 Infantry defends its position by employing all the
weapons at its disposal in cooperation with artillery fires
supported by combat aviation both pursuit and bombardment
As the enemy comes within range the infantry heavy
weapons including those of units in reserve are brought into
action
• 659 A unit intrusted with the defense of a tactical locality
under no circumstances abandons it unless authorized to do
so by higher authority Important localities on the main line
of resistance must be defended to the last man Local commanders
take the necessary steps to maintain their positions
rectifying gaps in their dispositions or fires by the use of
their supports Plans are made for the employment of local
reserves As the area of their probable employment becomes
apparent reserves are moved to be more readily available
for action
A 660 When the front and direction of the main hostile
attack have been determined the defense takes final steps to
meet it Combat aviation attacks those hostile elements
which constitute the greatest threat to the defense Artillery
and other supporting weapons deliver fires on the attacking
infantry As the hostile attacking elements come within effective
small-arms range and are unmasked by the withdrawing
outposts the defending force increases its fire with
all available weapons Threatened sectors not fully garrisoned
are occupied Chemical troops from positions well forward
supplement the fires of artillery and other supporting
weapons with fires on avenues of approach and on known or
probable areas occupied by the attacking troops The bulk

of the available reserves are held mobile prepared for aggressive
action
As the enemy attack draws closer machine guns switch
their fires to their final protective lines ; all weapons participate
in the fire fight until finally the enemy is stopped or
driven back
m 66 Reconnaissance is conducted and plans are prepared
for the employment of reserves based on the probable lines
of action which may develop during combat Reserves must
be prepared to occupy a previously reconnoitered defensive
area to check a hostile penetration or an envelopment of the
position or to deliver a counterattack for the purpose of
maintaining or restoring the main defensive position Reserves
are committed to the position only to the extent necessary
to stabilize the situation and establish a firm base from
which to launch a counterattack Motor transportation is
used to increase the mobility of reserves
• 662 Tanks are essentially offensive weapons They are
held in reserve in a covered position out of effective artillery
range until the situation is favorable for their employment
They constitute a powerful reserve in the hands of the commander
either to engage hostile tanks or to support a general
counterattack or counteroffensive
• 663 Should the enemy succeed in penetrating or outflanking
the position the defender seeks through fire and maneuver
to eject the hostile elements which have so advanced
The fire of the supporting artillery is concentrated on the
hostile elements which have entered the position Local reserves
supported by all available weapons and protected by
smoke from chemical mortars counterattack against the
flanks of the gap to thrust back the enemy before he has had
time to establish himself Such local counterattacks must
be launched during the period of temporary confusion and
disorganization which occurs when the attacking troops have
entered the position and have not had time to reorganize and
establish themselves This period is relatively short Consequently
the counterattack must be delivered without delay
on the initiative of the local commander The object of such
counterattack is to stabilize the situation on that particular
part of the position and prevent widening of the gap or
in case of a small penetration to eject the enemy Surprise

boldness and rapidity are the principal factors which lead
to successful execution Anticipatory planning to include
reconnaissance will facilitate greatly the prompt delivery of
the counterattack If the enemy is given time to reorganize
and to place his machine guns and antitank guns in position
to defend the ground he has gained the opportunity to counterattack
by local reserves probably has passed Then only
a well-prepared counterattack by larger reserves strongly
supported by combat aviation has much chance of success
i 664 Should the enemy succeed in penetrating through the
position with a strong mechanized attack it is essential that
units on the battle position close the gap thus created without
delay and before succeeding hostile units can exploit the
success attained The shoulders of the salient must be held
at all costs Local commanders must react promptly and on
their own initiative rectify the situation
E 665 If the enemy has attained such success that local commanders
are unable to eject him the higher commander must
decide whether to counterattack with reserves at his disposal
to restore the battle position to continue battle on the battle
position and prevent further enemy advance or to withdraw
to a prepared position in rear
Time is required for the preparation of a major counterattack
Sufficient reserves must be assembled to carry the
attack forward Adequate fire support must be arranged Assembly
positions zones of action objectives and time of attack
are clearly specified Surprise is an important factor Employment
of artillery chemical troops mechanized units and
combat aviation is regulated and controlled by the higher commander
Whenever practicable the counterattack Is launched
against the flanks of the hostile salient Advance planning
for such an operation Is essential in order to reduce to a minimum
the time required in final preparation
In reaching a decision to withdraw to a rearward position
the commander must carefully evaluate the time required to
reach and organize such a position and the effect of hostile
mechanized and air attacks on his withdrawing forces The
rapidity and power with which mechanized units and combat
aviation can strike indicate the necessity for the organization
and occupation of the rearward position prior to the withdrawal
of the forces directly engaged with the enemy Re-

serves of higher commanders are suitably employed on such
rearward positions To order a withdrawal to an unorganized
and unoccupied rear position in the face of attacks by mechanized
forces and combat aviation invites disaster for the
entire command
A 666 When the battle is interrupted by nightfall combat
outposts are established by front-line battalions (See par
678 ) Provision is made for patrolling and illuminating the
foreground and the intervals between defense areas Frontline
garrisons may be reinforced Machine guns are laid for
their final protective fires Provision is made to place the
defensive fires of artillery and other supporting weapons in
front of the combat outposts These fires cover those areas
that cannot be reached by rifle and machine-gun fire and
should be prepared while there is still some daylight They
are delivered on prearranged signals from the combat outposts
∎ 667 When the enemy succeeds in establishing himself on
favorable ground at close range from the main line of resistance
it may be advisable to redistribute the defending
forces in depth In such case the main line of resistance may
be shifted to the rear of the zone of resistance and the original
maih line of resistance held by combat outposts ; or the defense
may be transferred to a rear position in which case the
preparations for a withdrawal from action and a renewal
of the defense on the new position must be made in advance
(See ch ) Withdrawal to a rear position is as a rule advisable
only when the situation clearly shows that the first
position is untenable or will soon become untenable
0 668 When a stabilization of operations gradually develops
the decision must be made whether to push an outpost forward
and continue to hold the present position making the
necessary rectifications ; or to hold the old position as an
outpost position and transfer the principal forces to a rear
position (see par 64 ) which then becomes the main battle
position In either case a redistribution of forces is necessary
Measures are taken for the development and strengthening
of the new defensive position Obstacles are reinforced additional
mine fields are constructed defense against chemicals
is more thoroughly organized shelter is provided for
men and ammunition and measures are taken to provide for
the rest and comfort of troops

• 669 Where a stabilized situation develops or a defense
continues for a prolonged period the necessity for conservation
of the fighting power of the troops requires provision
for the periodic relief of units in line For the sake of continuity
in the execution of the plan of defense it is as a general
rule advantageous to avoid relieving the artillery and the
infantry at the same time
The relief is preceded by a detailed reconnaissance of the
sector by officers of the relieving unit If time permits all
commanders down to and including platoon leaders should
visit the position prior to the relief Commanders familiarize
themselves not only with the disposition of the defending
force but with the known hostile dispositions on their part
of the front Arrangements are completed for the transfer
of supplies and special equipment to be left on the position
by the unit relieved Sufficient guides are detailed from the
unit to be relieved to meet each infantry platoon or similar
element of the relieving force and conduct it to its position
! 670 Secrecy in planning and conduct of the relief is
essential to its successful accomplishment The relief should
be carried out under cover of darkness and in sufficient time
to permit the bulk of the relieved force to be beyond artillery
range prior to daylight Careful planning and proper supervision
will prevent congestion of incoming and outgoing troops
at critical points
• 67 The execution of the relief takes place under the direction
of the commander of the unit to be relieved ; he remains
responsible for the defense of the sector until the relief has
been completed

such an unfavorable position that superiority passes to the
defender The latter then has a prospect of st}ccess in a
counteroffensive which aims at a tactical decision the defeat

SECURITY IN THE DEFENSE
674 Prompt and continuing security measures are taken
in those directions from which the enemy is capable of attacking
Measures for counterreconuaissance are taken by all
troops and agencies in order to screen from the enemy the
preparations and dispositions made for defense
• 675 The enemy will seek to avoid disclosing the distribution
of his forces and the front of his main attack until his deployment
is completed The defense must gain contact with
the enemy at the earliest opportunity and maintain such contact
in order not to be taken by surprise Every available
means of reconnaissance is employed to locate the enemy and
determine the direction of his advance and the distribution of
his forces Additional information relating to the outlines of
the enemy's dispositions and the direction of his main attack
are sought during the delaying action of the covering forces
• 676 If the outpost is at a considerable distance from the
battle position the foreground of the battle position is temporarily
occupied by combat outposts detailed from each battalion
holding a sector of the main line of resistance
677 The mission of the combat outposts is to provide local
security and gain time for troops responsible for the defense
of the main line of resistance and to deceive the enemy regarding
where the main resistance is to be encountered As
long as the main outpost position is held combat outposts of
battalions on the main line of resistance may be relatively
weak The approximate strength of combat outposts may be
directed by the higher commander When there are no
friendly troops in front of them combat outposts maintain
close contact with the enemy
i 678 As a rule a combat outpost is established by each
front-line battalion or squadron in contact with the enemy
When battle is interrupted by nightfall combat outposts
push their patrols forward in close contact with the enemy
The action of the combat outposts in adjacent sectors is
coordinated by adjacent and higher commanders

ANTIMECHANIZED DEFENSE
Z 679 Defensive measures against mechanized units comprise
special weapons or the special use of existing weapons
natural and artificial obstacles organization of the ground
and a warning system (See ch 6 ) Antimechanized defense
must be organized in depth
• 680 The antitank gun is of first importance in antimechanized
defense Employment of antitank guns is based on a
minimum of guns in position initially to cover obstacles and
as a first echelon of defense and a maximum of guns as a
mobile reserve Based on information of hostile mechanized
forces reserve guns are moved rapidly to previously `reconnoitered
locations and so disposed in depth as to permit
timely and powerful reinforcement of areas threatened by
hostile mechanized attack
Guns intended solely for antimechanized use are kept concealed
until their special target appears ; their effectiveness
is jeopardized if their location is prematurely disclosed
Close-in protection of antitank guns must be provided by
other troops
• 68 Weapons whose primary missions are against objectives
other than mechanized units are used also against
mechanized vehicles to the limit of their effectiveness
Small-arms and machine-gun fire has a limited effect interfering
primarily with the enemy's observation High
explosive and incendiary hand grenades are effective against
certain types of armored vehicles
• 682 In the use of all direct laying weapons fire against
mechanized vehicles is withheld until they have come within
effective range
683 All supporting artillery must be prepared to assist in
antimechanized defense In both offensive and defensive
action provision should be made for the rapid concentration
of as much artillery fire as possible on all areas favoring the
assembly and maneuver of mechanized units particularly on
any defiles leading to such areas Antitank weapons furnish
the main defense against armored vehicles However when
a strong hostile mechanized attack is imminent light artillery
60
OPERATIONS
683-688
may be moved to positions from which to counter the hostile
mechanized vehicles by direct laying
• 684 Antiaircraft artillery weapons are suitable for use
against mechanized vehicles Every effort is made to assist
in antimechanized security by siting antiaircraft artillery
weapons so that they may be employed against mechanized
attack In the event of simultaneous attack by hostile aircraft
and mechanized forces fire must be concentrated
against the most dangerous threat For maximum effect
against mechanized vehicles special armor-piercing ammunition
must be provided
• 685 Large tank units and armored divisions are effective
means to counter hostile mechanized and armored forces
They must be used offensively in large groups on definite
counterattack missions usually for maneuver to deliver a
surprise blow against the flanks and rear of the hostile
mechanized force Their employment must be closely coordinated
with and supported by ground forces antimechanized
means and combat aviation
686 Combat aviation is a powerful weapon against mechanized
forces Bombing chemical and direct fire attacks
will be effective under many conditions It has the mobility
and fire power to strike and break up mechanized threats
before they arrive within range of artillery and antitank guns
i 687 Chemical agents may be used to restrict possible assembly
areas for armored units to cause casualties to units
in movement and to render difficult the removal of obstructions
or repair of demolitions Ordinarily persistent chemicals
will be most effective unless their use will interfere with
subsequent operation of friendly troops Under such circulnstances
the use of lung irritants tear sneeze or vomiting
gas may be advantageous
Improvised combustibles and explosives thrown by individuals
against the most vulnerable portions of enemy armored
vehicles are valuable means of supplementing close-in antimechanized
defense
i 688 Mines are an effective means of defense against mechanized
forces They can be laid or buried without prohibitive
expenditure of time and labor They usually are laid in irregular
checkerboard order in three or more rows avoiding

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
any strictly geometrical pattern Mine fields are installed
within the defended area as well as in front of it
Mines are useful for quickly blocking defiles and favorable
avenues of hostile approach The location of mines must be
coordinated with natural or artificial obstacles and with the
fire of antitank guns and other weapons They should be
concealed supplemented by dummy minefields and covered
by fire to prevent removal by the enemy
Mine fields contaminated areas and obstacles restrict the
movement of the troops which they are designed to protect
A record must be maintained of the location and extent of
such obstacles so that the necessary precautions may be prescribed
for the safety of troops
0 689 Natural obstacles to mechanized attack include buildings
and walls water courses lakes marshes mountainous
country stumps rocky ground and thick woods Few areas
can be classed as tankproof Undue reliance on natural
obstacles must be guarded against Guided by these considerations
the defensive possibilities of terrain must be
studied constantly from the viewpoint of antimechanized defense
in order to utilize existing natural obstacles to the
maximum
690 Artificial obstacles consist principally of mine fields
antitank ditches post obstacles barricades and demolitions
(For details see FM 5-30 ) The location of artificial obstacles
must be coordinated with natural obstacles and with the fire
of antitank and other weapons The main effort in the construction
of artificial obstacles is made on those parts of the
front possessing natural obstacles which are susceptible of
improvement ; the bulk of the antitank guns are placed to
cover the avenues favorable for tank action It is important
that obstacles be covered by fire to prevent hostile crews from
removing the obstructions Obstacles located well to the
front or flanks at critical points where the fire of antitank
guns or artillery is impracticable may serve to canalize halt
or delay mechanized units thereby providing favorable targets
for combat aviation Removal of obstacles can be impeded
by contamination with persistent chemical agents In
general obstacles demolitions mines and persistent chemical
contaminations are located where the enemy will come upon
them suddenly and be unable to avoid them

OPERATIONS
690-694
If the hostile mechanized attack succeeds in entering or
breaking through the battle position it must be stopped
thrown back or destroyed either by antitank units by mechanized
counterattack or by both means Effort is made to
break the hostile forces into small groups which can be
destroyed more easily
• 69 It may be impracticable or inadvisable to direct the
main effort of the counterattack against the enemy's mechanized
force A mechanized attack once launched and initially
successful proceeds with such rapidity that an attempt to
direct countermeasures against the mechanized vehicles may
result in a direct pursuit rather than an attack A counterattack
against the base or flank of a salient may often be
more effective than one against its point
• 692 A counterattack directed at the rear of a mechanized
attack will usually meet other mobile supporting troops rather
than mechanized units
Such a counterattack employs all available arms including
the mechanized forces of the defender It has the characteristics
of a mechanized attack that is it leads with mechanized
units and exploits with motorized horse and foot troops It
seeks to close the gap created by the hostile mechanized force
and to isolate and eventually destroy the enemy's advanced
elements including his mechanized forces However deeply
these last may penetrate and however great the damage
they may do once their supply lines are cut they will be
immobilized and in the end destroyed
• 693 All available fire support is used in the counterattack
If the counterattack is directed against the enemy's mechanized
force this fire support should be strong in antitank
cannon
• 694 Supporting combat aviation is used at the crisis of the
action to the limit of its availability It may be directed
against enemy front-line units in direct support of ground
units engaged in counterattack or to cause confusion in rear
areas interfere with maneuver and disrupt routes of communication
It is employed on missions which further the
attainment of the objective of the supported forces It is not
used on missions divergent from this purpose

695
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
0 695 The counterattack is conducted by units initially in
reserve The introduction of enemy mechanized forces into
the situation affects the composition location and equipment
of these reserves They should be highly mobile and strong
in mechanized and motorized elements and antitank weapons
They should be located to permit timely and rapid movement
toward any point where an enemy mechanized attack may
be expected

CHAPTER
RETROGRADE MOVEMENTS
GENERAL
• 696 A retrograde movement is any movement of a command
to the rear or away from the enemy It may be forced
by the enemy or may be made voluntarily It may be classified
as a withdrawal from action a delaying action or a
retirement
•
697 Retrograde movements are made to accomplish one or
more of the following purposes:
a To disengage from battle
b To avoid battle in a disadvantageous situation
c To draw the enemy into a situation unfavorable to him
d To gain time without fighting a decisive engagement
e To conform to the movement of other troops
f To permit the employment of a portion of the command
elsewhere
• 698 Retrograde movements in the face of the enemy are
difficult maneuvers and require constant control and supervision
by all leaders Mechanized forces and combat aviation
have increased the difficulties in executing these maneuvers
and the necessity of organizing and occupying rear positions
prior to the retrograde movement (See par 665 )
Prompt reorganization of units careful attention to the feeding
and care of the men and the presence of higher commanders
well forward will tend to counteract the detrimental
effects of this type of action
• 699 Demolitions obstructions and contaminations are
used to the maximum in all retrograde movements in order
to delay hostile pursuit to assist in flank protection and to
destroy materials and resources that may have to be abandoned
Plans for this work must be prepared well in advance
• 700 Combat aviation is employed against hostile observation
aviation and to delay the hostile follow-up or pursuit
by harassing and interdicting hostile forces at critical local-
65
700-706
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
ities Its action must be coordinated with that of flank and
rear guards
• 70 In retrograde movements maximum advantage must
be taken of available motor transportation to expedite the
rapid movement to the rear of units which have withdrawn
from action Security forces should consist of highly mobile
units
A 702 A hostile force strong in mechanized and motorized
units and combat aviation may be expected to follow up or
to pursue any retrograde movement relentlessly both by day
and by night (See also par 665 ) This necessitates continuous
ground and aerial reconnaissance to both flanks and
rear rapid movement under cover of darkness strong antiaircraft
defense and continuous all-around antimechanized
defense particularly on exposed flanks Close support by
combat aviation is essential Mobile reserves particularly
mechanized and antitank units are held out in order to
counteract wide and rapid movements to our flanks and rear
or penetration through our front and to counter any attacks
by troops transported by air
WITHDRAWAL FROM ACTION
• 703 A withdrawal from action is the operation of breaking
off combat with a hostile force The general purpose of the
operation is to regain or preserve freedom of action
• 704 A daylight withdrawal usually involves such heavy
losses and so great a degree of disorganization that it is
preferable for large units to hold out at all costs until nightfall
and effect the withdrawal under the cover of darkness
As a rule only rearward echelons can be withdrawn successfully
by day Small mobile forces may execute daylight
withdrawals
• 705 The heavier the previous fighting and the closer the
engagement with the enemy the more difficult will be the
withdrawal
• 706 A withdrawal is facilitated by concealment of dispositions
and movements by bad weather by rapidity of movement
by the careful preparation of plans and by counterattacks
Successful counterattacks often create conditions most

favorable to the withdrawal Because of their mobility and
fire power combat aviation and mechanized units are especially
suited to support counterattacks
0 707 The commander who orders a withdrawal designates
a rearward position on which the troops will prepare for a
renewal of resistance or under the protection of which the
troops may be assembled for further retrograde movement
The rearward position is selected at such distance that the
enemy will be compelled to regroup his forces displace his
artillery and renew his preparations for attack The commander
usually determines the location of the position from
the map He then issues the necessary orders for reconnaissance
of the position and routes thereto
The commander makes special provision for holding the
road centers that control the lines of communication to the
rear and the features of the terrain that afford extended
observation over the areas in rear of the battle front
708 In a daylight withdrawal in addition to the rearward
position the commander selects a suitable covering position
and details from any available reserves a mobile covering
force strong in fire power to occupy it and cover the withdrawal
of the troops engaged Artillery engineers antiaircraft
automatic weapons antitank weapons and chemical
troops are attached to the covering force
• 709 The mission of the covering force is to stop restrict
or divert the advancd of the enemy in order to permit the
main body of our troops to disengage assemble and move to
the rear The successful accomplishment of this mission depends
largely on the composition and location of the covering
force and on the efficient execution of a systematic plan of
artillery and machine-gun defensive fires Often the mission
can be best accomplished by counterattack
7 0 The position of the covering force in a daylight withdrawal
is selected so that it will cover the routes of withdrawal
and the assembly position of the main body Under
certain conditions the occupation of a flank position may be
advisable in order to force the enemy to execute a time consuming
maneuver
When its mission is accomplished the covering force withdraws
to the rearward position

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
∎ 7 In his order for the withdrawal the commander indicates
the rear position assigns zones or routes of withdrawal
to the units of the command prescribes the strength and
conduct of the covering forces fixes the hour and the priority
of withdrawal of units orders the establishment of essential
signal communication and takes the necessary steps to clear
the routes for the movement of troops Prompt starting
of trains to the new areas evacuation of the wounded removal
or destruction of supplies energetic measures for the
maintenance of traffic control construction of necessary
bridges and preparations for the execution of demolitions
on the routes of withdrawal are of importance Adequate
measures are taken to insure secrecy and for antiaircraft
and antimechanized defense Measures are instituted to regulate
or silence radio communication
The new command post is designated early and preparations
are made for establishing a landing field nearby (See
FM 0 -5 )
M 7 2 It is best usually to withdraw the least heavily engaged
units first When the terrain is favorable and the
security of the command permits it all subordinate units
may be withdrawn simultaneously However it usually is
necessary to move certain units ahead of others in order to
avoid congestion and to insure a smooth execution of the
movement This procedure also gives greater security to
the command because the units remaining temporarily in
place cover the withdrawal of those first to move In some
situations counterattack may make it possible to withdraw
first those units which are hardest pressed or which are exposed
to the most dangerous threats However when necessary
to protect the command as a whole these hard-pressed
units must stay to the last It is better to run the risk of
losing certain units than to jeopardize the whole command
7 3 The zone of action for the withdrawal should provide
the best and most direct routes to the rear position The
movement of subordinate units is coordinated by assigning
to them zones of action or definite routes Generally zones
of action are assigned to the main combat units especially if
they may have to fight while moving back Routes generally
are assigned to trains and to those units which move to the
rear under control of the higher command; such units may
68

7 3-7 7
include artillery tanks and reserves The zones of action or
routes so assigned should usually extend to the rear position
If the rear position is distant the zones or routes should be
indicated back to a distance of day's march
• 7 4 At night the withdrawal of the greater part of the
forces engaged commences shortly after nightfall Small detachments
are left in immediate contact with the enemy
These detachments formed from troops nearest the enemy
should be well-supplied with automatic weapons ammunition
and pyrotechnics In view of the broad front upon which
they are deployed a single covering force commander ordinarily
cannot maintain effective control The superior commander
therefore provides artillery support coordinates
the action of the elements holding the various sectors indicates
the time of their withdrawal and prescribes their action
in case of hostile attack They may be directed to withdraw
either at a prescribed hour or upon order
i 7 5 The detachments left in contact with the enemy at
night screen the withdrawal by simulating normal activity
By firing from different positions reconnaissance of combat
patrols and sending up pyrotechnics they endeavor to create
the impression of normally held lines
Whenever practicable the foot elements of these detachments
should be furnished motor transportation for movement
to the rear Motor transportation is especially desirable
when the distance of the retrograde movement is great
• 7 6 Whether the rearward position is organized for defense
or is the area in which the command will be assembled
for further retrograde movement the commander makes
provision for a covering force in front of this position The
mission of this covering force is to cover the withdrawal of
the detachments left in close contact with the enemy and
of the artillery supporting these detachments It has the
further mission of protecting the assembly of the main body
for further retrograde movement or to serve as an initial
outpost if the rearward position is to be defended
• 7 7 At night the withdrawal of front line units is executed
on a broad front Troops withdraw initially straight to the
rear and then move to designated assembly areas where
small units are reformed and preparations are made for
further rearward movement and assembly into larger units

7 8-725
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
• 7 8 At night a part of the artillery remains in position
to support the elements still in contact It increases its fire
activity to deceive the enemy as to the amount of artillery in
action and assists the troops in contact in breaking off combat
Well supplied with ammunition and protected for allaround
defense this artillery sacrifices itself if necessary to
insure the withdrawal of the supported elements The remainder
of the artillery is withdrawn to the rearward position
priority in movement being given to the heavier calibers
• 7 9 During withdrawals antiaircraft artillery furnishes
protection for the assembly areas the heads of columns and
particularly critical localities along the routes of withdrawal
•
720 Cavalry protects withdrawing troops by reconnaissance
protection of the flanks and delaying action
• 72 Continuous reconnaissance is made to facilitate the
employment of antitank units to protect withdrawing troops
against mechanized attack
• 722 Tanks are useful in daylight withdrawals particularly
in counterattacks to assist other ground units in breaking contact
with the enemy When practicable their action is coordinated
with that of combat aviation They are not ordinarily
used in night withdrawals
• 723 Persistent chemicals may be used to deny or make
costly the use of probable approaches Smoke may be useful
in covering the daylight withdrawal of a unit over terrain
exposed to enemy fire
• 724 In addition to their primary mission of effecting road
blocks and demolitions engineers reconnoiter repair and
mark roads In certain situations they reconnoiter and stake
out rear positions and furnish guides They assist the rearward
movement of artillery mechanized and other units ;
destroy materials to be abandoned ; act as part of a covering
force; and constitute an emergency reserve
RETIREMENT
• 725 A retirement is a retrograde movement in which a
force seeks to regain freedom of action the movement being
part of a well-defined plan which has for its purpose the refusal
of decisive combat under the existing situation A
retirement may be made in one stage or in several stages
70
OPERATIONS
725-730
depending upon the distance involved When a withdrawal
from action precedes the retirement the actual retirement
begins when march columns are formed
• 726 Without competent orders to do so a decision to retire
is Justified only when all possibilities of accomplishing the
assigned mission have been exhausted and a continuation
of the battle will lead either to excessive losses or to a decisive
defeat
No commander is authorized to order a retirement on his
own initiative simply because of local misfortune or reverses
suffered by an adjacent unit
• 727 In retirements following a withdrawal the most important
considerations for a commander are to place distance
obstacles and a rear guard between his main body and
the enemy and to regain his freedom of action
Trains are put in march without delay if necessary under
escort and sent to the rear to a selected bivouac area During
their retirement they establish dumps of ammunition
rations fuel and other supplies en route to meet the needs
of the retiring troops
Antiaircraft protection of important defiles on the route
of retirement is established
As fast as troop units arrive in assembly areas they are
formed into small columns and set in motion to the rear
• 728 Road march formations usually are taken up when
the zone of effective hostile light artillery fire is passed
Formations are modified to meet existing conditions of terrain
visibility intensity of enemy fire activity of enemy combat
aviation and tactical requirements for control and rapidity
of movement
• 729 During the initial phase of retirement made from contact
the division generally assigns specific routes to the trains
the artillery and other auxiliary troops and indicates when
the routes will be cleared for the other troops A zone of
action usually is assigned to each combat unit comparable to
an infantry regiment in size
• 730 As the distance from the enemy increases small columns
are consolidated into larger columns constituted as
combat teams During the march to the rear constant effort
is made to increase the distance from the enemy This will

730-734
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
necessitate night and forced marches as well as effective security
measures to protect the rear and the flanks and to delay
the enemy
• 73 The actual terrain objective toward which a retirement
is directed depends upon the mission of the command
and the purpose of the movement It should be such as to
favor the future action of the command Factors which influence
the selection of this objective are the actual and
potential strength of the enemy; reinforcements that may
become available ; the time when the enemy can arrive at
critical localities on the route of the retirement ; and the extent
that terrain and the weather favor hostile movement
and interfere with friendly movements
• 732 The formation and number of columns to be employed
during retirement depend principally upon the number of
roads available and the hostile interference It generally is
desirable to move the major fractions of a deployed force to
the rear simultaneously and abreast of each other However
a' hostile threat to a flank may make it necessary for one
fraction to hold in position until the movement of the others
is well under way A restricted road net or defiles in the zone
of movement may necessitate withdrawals of fractions successively
If a flank is threatened during the retirement the
adoption of an echeloned formation may be appropriate
• 733 The retirement order of a small command usually
designates the time when each subordinate unit commences
its movement In commands the size of a division or larger
the commander usually designates the time that major portions
of the command pass initial points or lines and when
appropriate the hour that certain lines or assembly areas
must be cleared (See FM 0 -5 )
• 734 Clearing the routes of march and organizing an effective
zone of obstacles to delay the enemy's pursuing columns
are of greatest importance
Engineers are sent back early to reconnoiter and improve
the routes of retirement repair bridges and prepare obstacles
and demolitions to be executed by the rear guard Pertinent
information of the location of obstacles and of the nature of
the demolitions and contaminations prepared is furnished to
the retiring troops Measures are taken to prevent their en-

dangering our own troops and to insure their execution at
the proper time Chemical troops with chemical mines may be
attached to the engineers for the contamination of obstacles
and demolitions
• 735 Traffic is regulated at critical points to prevent congestion
especially in towns at bridges and at other defiles
Strong antiaircraft and antitank protection is established at
these critical localities until they are cleared by the main
body
• 736 Security detachments are provided with sufficient
artillery to support them in the execution of their missions
The remainder of the artillery is so disposed in the retiring
columns as best to protect the main body or support the
security detachments
• 737 The antiaircraft artillery is disposed to protect the
most vital points on the routes of the retiring columns As
the retirement progresses the antiaircraft artillery moves
rapidly by bounds from area to area and frequently is given
priority on the roads
• 738 During a retirement cavalry is employed on security
missions and frequently may constitute or be attached to the
rear or flank guards Reconnaissance particularly to obtain
information of any hostile movement directed toward the
flanks is important and is assigned to the cavalry or to the
security detachment controlling the cavalry
• 739 Observation aviation must keep under observation any
hostile forces that are in position to interfere with the retirement
especially on the flanks It should maintain close
liaison with the security detachments Airplanes usually
are placed at the disposal of the artillery with rear guards to
observe their long-range fires
Combat aviation is employed to delay the hostile pursuit
Its action is coordinated with that of the security detachments
• 740 Engineers accompany or precede the main columns to
facilitate their movement Suitable detachments are attached
to rear and flank guards to assist in delaying the
enemy Some engineers may be employed in certain situations
to reconnoiter and stake out rear defensive positions
73
74 -745
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
74 A retirement generally offers opportunities for the
use of chemicals of all kinds Smoke may assist security detachments
in concealing their movements during successive
withdrawals
• 742 In retirement orders present command posts and the
next ones to be occupied should be specified Axes of signal
communication should be indicated as far to the rear as it
is practicable to foresee them
SECURITY DURING RETIREMENT
• 743 All-around security must be provided In a short retirement
which can be completed in one night the covering
force for the withdrawal usually gives sufficient protection for
the movement (See par 7 6 ) If the movement continues
after daylight a rear guard normally should be
formed to protect the march of the main bodies Initially
this rear guard consists of the troops which covered the assembly
of the main body reinforced by contingents of other
arms as required by the situation
744 The mission of the rear guard is to protect the main
body from surprise harassment and attack By the successful
execution of this mission a rear guard covering a retirement
enables the main body to avoid accepting battle and
regains for the commander of the force his freedom of action
The strength and composition of a rear guard are such as
to permit the execution of its mission without the intervention
of the main body When necessary for the security
of the main body the rear guard sacrifices itself in the
execution of its mission
0 745 A rear guard covering the retirement of a combined
force consists principally of infantry strong in automatic
weapons supported by artillery Units of other arms are
added in accordance with the requirements of the situation
Antitank weapons mechanized units signal troops chemical
troops and engineers may be included
The ability of cavalry to conduct delaying action makes it
an important element of a rear guard When the main body
has succeeded in gaining sufficient distance from the enemy
cavalry may constitute the principal element of the rear
guard
74
OPERATIONS
746-749
• 746 The formation and the method of operation of the
rear guard are adapted to the situation Movement to the
rear is made by bounds based on the progress of the main
body and the time limit set by the higher commander for
holding designated terrain lines The distance between the
rear guard and the main body is determined accordingly
Delays fn the retirement of the main body must be expected
• 747 When in contact with the enemy the rear guard distributes
its forces in groups over a wide front and opens long
range fire with its artillery and other supporting weapons to
force the enemy to deploy and thus to delay his advance
Unless the security of the main body requires a stubborn
resistance the rear guard as far as practicable avoids close
range combat and withdraws successively from position to
position as the enemy approaches
The successive positions of the rear guard are chosen at
such distance from each other that the enemy is forced to
renew his preparations for attack in front of each of them
and that changes of position by the artillery of the rear
guard are reduced to a minimum A rear guard position
should favor withdrawal by affording covered routes
• 748 When the enemy presses his pursuit closely greater
resistance is offered Advantage is taken of favorable opportunities
to punish overhasty pursuit by counterattack Attack
against the flanks of pursuing columns by mechanized
troops or cavalry is an effective means of disorganizing the
pursuit The most favorable time for offering a determined
resistance is during the late hours of the day to permit withdrawal
of the rear guard under cover of darkness
• 749 When the distance from the enemy permits the rear
guard retires in march formation Its distribution corresponds
in general to that of an advance guard and in
reverse order of march comprising the reserve the support
and the rear guard cavalry or motorized detachment The
support provides a rear party and necessary flank patrols
Because of the direction of march infantry reconnaissance
during the retirement is much more restricted than in case
of an advance guard Chief reliance for the execution of the
necessary reconnaissances must be placed upon cavalry mechanized
units and observation aviation Mobile troops especially
observe and forestall attempts to pass the flanks of the
rear guard
75
750-753
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
∎ 750 When there is likelihood of attack by mobile troops
against the heads of the retreating columns advance guards
are detailed They are composed of mobile troops reinforced
by antitank and engineer detachments If there is no threat
against the heads of the columns the principal missions of
the advance guard will be to clear routes of march insure the)
uninterrupted movement of the main body and regulate civilian
and refugee traffic For the latter purpose military
police are attached
75 Flank security is of especial importance during a retirement
When there is danger of an encircling maneuver
in pursuit flank guards composed of mobile troops with
engineer antitank and chemical units attached are detailed
to cover the exposed flank When opposed by an
enemy strong in mechanized and air forces special attention
must be paid to the security of the routes of retirement and
the area or position to which the troops are retiring Under
such conditions it will normally be necessary to employ forces
other than those retiring to occupy and organize the rear
position before it is reached by the retiring forces When
conditions permit the rear position is organized behind
strong natural obstacles
DELAYING ACTION
5 752 Recourse to delaying action ordinarily implies either
lack of readiness for battle or hostile superiority of force
Its purpose is to gain time while avoiding decisive action
Delaying action may be used in the opening phases of
battle to gain time for the unified employment of the entire
command It may also be called for in later phases pending
completion of preparations for counteroffensive action It
finds especial application in the operations of covering forces
and other security detachments
In offensive operations delaying action by a portion of
the command to delay the arrival of hostile reinforcements
may be of decisive importance
753 Delay of an advancing enemy may be accomplished
by offensive action by defensive action in one position by
delaying action in successive positions or by any combination
of these methods
76
OPERATIONS
754-756
754 Skillful use of terrain has a decided influence on all
delaying operations A series of parallel ridges across the
lines of hostile advance; unfordable streams swamps lakes
and other obstacles on the front and flanks ; high ground with
good observation and good fields of fire at long range ; congealed
routes of withdrawal immediately behind delaying
positions ; and a good road net all favor the execution of
delaying action
® 755 In situations where the enemy has freedom of maneuver
and mobile troops and the flanks of a delaying force
are open to hostile attack the protection of the flanks and
rear is of vital importance Since the enemy may succeed
in pushing by the flanks or in executing a wider maneuver
with mobile forces to strike in rear of an occupied delaying
position the commander must make provision to block or
destroy such forces
Ground and aerial reconnaissance forces must be continuously
on the alert to locate such threats to flanks and
rear
∎ 756 Delaying action in successive positions is based on
limited resistance on a position with the intention of renewing
this resistance in successive positions if necessary The
defense on each position must force the enemy to early
deployment and to time-consuming preparations for battle
Combat ordinarily is broken off in each position before troops
become closely engaged The situation may however require
a strong resistance on some position or even a counterattack
in order to accomplish the delaying mission
The delaying measures are continued between positions in
order to gain time for organizing resistance on the next position
Because of the retrograde and long range nature of
such combat delaying action is executed most effectively by
troops possessing a high degree of mobility and great fire
power especially at longer ranges
In general contact is made as far forward as possible and
continuous light resistance is offered in order to compel the
enemy to employ his whole force and to consume a maximum
of time No more ground than necessary is given up The
ability to execute planned withdrawals under conditions that
permit orderly movement to the rear must however be
retained
77
757-760
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
• 757 In open terrain the important consideration in the
selection of a delaying position is a good field of fire at long
range Field of fire at close range is of less importance In
close and wooded terrain observation and field of fire are
equally unfavorable for both sides ; the defender can however
make full use of the cover concealment and obstacles offered
by the terrain whereas the attacker is restricted in movement
and is unable to exploit fully his superiority of means
The ground in rear of the position should favor a covered
withdrawal by screening the troops from hostile view and fire
as soon as the position is vacated
Field fortifications are reduced to the minimum ; full use is
made of obstacles demolitions and chemical interdictions in
front and on the flanks of the position and in the areas between
successive positions
• 758 The conduct of delaying action is facilitated in open
terrain by selecting successive positions on high ground at
such distance apart that the enemy will be forced to displace
his artillery in order to attack the next position in rear In
wooded terrain the infantry bears the brunt of combat and
successive positions may be much closer together
In each position the main line of resistance should insure
facilities for artillery observation and for the delivery of
effective long range fire by other supporting weapons In
general the depth of the zone of resistance is not great The
artillery and the other supporting weapons are located close
to the line of resistance
9 759 When the enemy has superiority in combat aviation or
mechanized forces or both the commander must ordinarily
delay on a position until nightfall and then withdraw under
cover of darkness to the rear position Considerable distance
between positions enables the commander to utilize fully the
hours of darkness for withdrawal In such situations selection
of positions strongly protected by natural obstacles which
facilitate defense on a broad front becomes a primary consideration
3 760 In order to coordinate the operations the combat
zone is subdivided into sectors the boundaries of which are
extended to the rear to include initially the first two delaying
positions and later the final position in the commander's plan
of action In favorable terrain the width of sectors in delay-
78
OPERATIONS
760-765
ing action may be taken as about double those suitable for
defense
A tactical unit is assigned to each sector and is given a
combat mission The strength and composition of each unit
is determined by the assigned mission the terrain the width
bf the sector and the nature of the hostile threat Mutual
support between adjacent units is coordinated by the next
higher commander
Decentralization of operations to combat team commanders
will be frequent when operating on a broad front Continuous
liaison between adjacent combat teams and between
combat teams and the higher commander must be maintained
• 76 The defense is conducted in each sector by small units
holding the natural strong points of the terrain and supporting
each other by flanking fire In close terrain or during
periods of low visibility close contact between adjacent
units is maintained by combat patrols Local reserves protect
the flanks of front line defense areas and cover the withdrawal
of forward elements
• 762 Artillery in general support prepares a plan of interdiction
fires covering principal hostile avenues of approach
and is prepared to engage distant targets It is employed to
reinforce the artillery in direct support in accordance with
the requirements of the situation Special attention will be
given to interdiction of hostile movements toward the flanks
and rear
Light artillery will often be attached to the unit it supports
763 Engineers are employed to construct a barrier zone
of obstacles and demolitions in front of the first delaying
position and in the area between successive positions Antitank
units are attached to units covering the hostile avenues
of approach To protect an exposed flank a mobile flank
guard is detailed with engineers and antitank units attached
• 764 Chemical troops may be employed to place barriers
of persistent chemicals on the front and flanks of each position
• 765 The antiaircraft artillery is employed primarily to
protect the artillery reserves and critical defiles in rear
from hostile air attack
79
766-77
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
• 766 A mobile reserve reinforced by tanks artillery antitank
units engineers and chemical troops is prepared to
move rapidly to counter mobile threats
• 767 As in the defense of any position an outpost strong
in automatic weapons is deployed well in front of the delaying
position to harass and delay the enemy's advance and tb
keep him in doubt as to its location Artillery support for
the outpost will be provided by units supporting the delaying
position
M 768 The greatest importance attaches to keeping the enemy
in doubt as long as possible: concerning the location of
the successive delaying positions and the delaying nature of
the operations being conducted
• 769 In fighting a delaying action some troops are disposed
on the rear position to cover the withdrawal from the positions
in front
• 770 Timely measures are taken for reconnaissance and for
preparation necessary for the occupation of the successive
delaying positions in rear
Provision is made for the establishment of wire communication
from the higher commander to the sector commanders
and to the senior artillery commander Of especial importance
is efficient operation of the artillery wire net in
order that the flexibility of artillery fire may be exploited
to the maximum Signal communication to distant or detached
units is ordinarily limited to radio and messengers
The wire systems of subordinate units are limited to essential
lines Full use is made of prearranged visual signals
and of mounted and motorcycle messengers
• 77 The commander controls the operation by prescribing
the time of withdrawal and the time by which each successive
position is to be occupied In open terrain it is often
better to make a timely and simultaneous withdrawal from
each position In close terrain or when a command is deployed
over a wide front this may be impracticable and the
decision regarding the time of withdrawal is then left to
subordinate commanders The commander exercises control
by prescribing a general terrain line to which units eventually
will withdraw or in front of which the enemy will be
held until a designated hour

OPERATIONS
772-773
• 772 Whenever practicable withdrawal from a position is
effected under cover of darkness If protracted resistance is
necessary to accomplish this measures are taken to extend
the depth of the zone of resistance and to utilize to the
maximum natural obstacles
• 773 If the withdrawal must be made in daylight artillery
and other supporting weapons are disposed in depth Combat
aviation and tanks are employed against those hostile
elements which most seriously threaten the success of the
operation A daylight withdrawal may also be facilitated
by organizing an intermediate delaying (covering) position
to be occupied by reserves assigned to cover the withdrawal
of troops in front (see par 708) Subsequent withdrawal of
the troops from the intermediate delaying position is in
turn covered by other troops on the next delaying position
in rear Retirement may thus be executed by the alternate
withdrawal of successive echelons from one delaying position
to the next
The loss of a defended tactical locality to the enemy does
not necessarily involve an early withdrawal along the whole
front Adjacent units should take advantage of such situations
to punish an impetuous enemy by heavy flanking
fire and by local counterattacks whenever conditions are
favorable

and the time element in signal communication and staff
action may be so short that the air unit must be attached
to the ground unit for operational control for definite limited
periods
0 042 Support of troops transported by air requires extremely
close coordination and close control Such operations
require special air force support including convoy' by
pursuit aviation to prevent hostile air action against the
expedition while in flight and on the ground after landing
Preliminary air attack on the landing area and its vicinity
may be required to destroy or disorganize local defenses
During the landing and subsequent ground operations supporting
air operations include the laying of a smoke screen
and the attack of defending or counterattacking units both
ground and air While in flight control of the movement
is a responsibility of the air commander

CHAPTER 5
THE DIVISION
SECTION I
INFANTRY DIVISION
0 043 The infantry division is the basis of organization of
the field forces It is the basic large unit of which corps
(except armored and cavalry) and armies are formed It is
the smallest unit that is composed of all the essential ground
arms and services and which can conduct by its own means
operations of general importance It can strike or penetrate
effectively maneuver readily and absorb reinforcing units
easily It can act alone or as part of a higher unit
The combat value of the infantry division derives from its
ability to combine the action of the various arms and services
to maintain combat over a considerable period of time In
active operations the division should be reinforced with air
observation means
When operating alone additional aviation engineer antitank
and supply means will normally be required by the division
0 044 There are two types of infantry divisions in the
United States Army which for convenience are designated as
the "square" and the "triangular" division The square division
retains the brigade organization for infantry and artillery
components each infantry brigade consisting of two infantry
regiments the artillery brigade of three regiments In
the triangular division on the other hand there is no brigade
organization Three infantry regiments and four field
artillery battalions comprise the major combat elements
All organic transportation of the square and the triangular
infantry divisions is motorized Neither of these divisions is
provided however with sufficient transportation to move all
its elements simultaneously
The triangular division organization eliminates the brigade
echelon in the chain of command with a corresponding
acceleration of order transmission The field artillery bat-
253
044- 049
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
talions operate directly under the orders of the division artillery
officer representing the division commander
045 The doctrines of operations and combat by ground
nonmechanized forces discussed in earlier chapters of this
manual are applicable to the infantry division
046 When a division is operating as part of a higher unit
restrictions on the freedom of action of the division commander
are often necessarily imposed by the higher commander
In an advance the corps commander will ordinarily
prescribe a zone of advance for each division of the corps
The road net within the zone may largely influence the march
formations and supply arrangements within the division
The corps may also prescribe the general line which advance
guards of the divisions will cross at a given time at the beginning
of the march the extent of the march as well as any
special formation of the corps for the advance
Further coordination may be obtained by designating lines
which the various divisions must clear by specified times and
by designating rear boundaries for divisions at the completion
of each stage of the march
047 The army or corps has reconnaissance elements which
operate in advance of the divisions While cooperation and
contact between these reconnaissance elements and those of
the division are necessary their presence in no way relieves
the division commander of responsibility for reconnaissance
by and security for his own command
048 In combat the mission assigned the division may
require the division to act in close coordination and cooperation
with adjacent divisions or to operate at a distance from
the main force The decisions and actions of the division
commander in either situation are predicated upon the greatest
assistance to the successful execution of the task of the
higher commander
049 In all operations the personal reconnaissance of the
division commander is of the highest importance 'He makes
use of all available means of transportation to reach vantage
points from which he can gain direct information and exert
his influence most effectively and expeditiously on the operations
He must be provided with alternate means of signal
communication so that his orders can be speedily transmitted
254
OPERATIONS
050- 052
SECTION II
MOTORIZED DIVISION
050 The motorized division is a triangular infantry division
which has sufficient additional organic motor transportation
to permit the simultaneous movement of all its
elements
∎ 05 The motorized division is a specially equipped highly
mobile unit intended primarily for employment by higher
commanders It has greater capability than the normal infantry
division for rapid movement under suitable conditions
but when dismounted maneuvers and fights in the same
manner as the normal division The characteristics of the
motorized division make it especially suited to execute the
following types of operations:
To provide close support of armored or tank units ; to consolidate
and hold gains made; to protect the flanks and rear
of armored or tank units and permit their continued advance ;
to relieve armored units when terrain renders their operations
unremunerative ; and to protect armored or tank elements
when withdrawn or halted periodically to refuel or to
reorganize
To seize and hold important localities pending arrival of
less mobile forces
To exploit success achieved by armored tank parachute
and other units
To execute envelopments and turning movements either in
close cooperation with armored and other mobile units or
under favorable conditions independently against hostile
flanks and rear or strategic localities
To constitute a powerful mobile general reserve for use
either offensively or defensively as the situation demands
∎ 052 Except in emergency situations motorized divisions
should be employed on missions which permit initially the
utilization of their inherent mobility primarily in support
of or in cooperation with other mobile forces When an independent
or semi-independent mission is contemplated for
a motorized division provisions should be made for reinforcing
it with reconnaissance and security means tanks additional
motorized engineers artillery or other necessary units

tion both day and night by means of vehicular radio periodic
reports control posts guides direction signs and other
expedients Additional control and coordination of reconnaissance
security and combat teams may be assured by
designation of phase lines
Maximum exploitation of the mobility of the motorized
division by day will be contingent upon control of the air
for the area of movement by motor At all times dispositions
must be made with due consideration of hostile air
observation and attack An adequate observation and warning
system must be in operation continuously and include
both ground and air elements Vehicular antiaircraft weapons
must be manned and alert for prompt action at all times
during movement and at halts Maximum use of cover concealment
and camouflage must be habitual Distances between
columns and vehicles in column are increased but
with due regard for the greater time length of the columns
and its effect on the tactical employment of the division
Close cooperation and coordination of reconnaissance and
security agencies of all echelons are essential to assure rapid
uninterrupted and secure movement of motorized units
Reconnaissance and security groups obtain and transmit
timely information of terrain routes and enemy dispositions
so as to prevent delay or countermarching of other elements
Engineer reconnaissance agents should accompany divisional
ground reconnaissance groups
053 The motorized division operates normally as two or
more closely coordinated combat teams which may advance
by separate routes or zones previously examined by reconnaissance
agencies When the situation calls for a strong
attack the division is assembled for concerted action by appropriate
maneuver so as to develop its full power
Operations must be conducted with the maximum speed
consistent with conditions of terrain roads and the tactical
situation For this reason engineers must march well forward
in order to insure expeditious advance in difficult areas
and negotiation of difficult points Similarly commanders
must habitually move near the head of respective groups
Decisions must be timely Orders must be brief normally
oral and fragmentary and transmitted by the most rapid
means available-radio visual signals staff officer or vehicular
messenger
256
OPERATIONS
053- 055
While speed and boldness must characterize the operations
of motorized divisions development for combat must be with
a proper appreciation of vulnerability to hostile combat aviation
artillery and mechanized units In the approach march
motors move across country when practicable with security
provided by reconnaissance vehicles Assembly areas or detrucking
points should provide maximum security and cover
for personnel and vehicles and be reasonably secure against
effective hostile artillery fire Parks for personnel carriers
must be properly concealed and camouflaged Park locations
should facilitate protection without necessity for detachment
of combat elements for that purpose Anticipatory
measures for further movement of vehicles from assembly
areas or parks must be habitual to include liaison agents and
communication with combat elements reconnaissance of forward
and rear routes and preparation of routes by engineers
Motorized divisions which are supporting armored units
must provide close support and prompt relief in order to
facilitate the continued rapid advance of the armored troops
In situations where further operation of the motorized
division is unprofitable it should be relieved promptly by less
mobile troops and released for use where its mobility can be
utilized
In exploiting a break-through motorized divisions may be
used in support of or in conjunction with armored divisions
∎ 054 The mobility of the motorized division provides
higher commanders a powerful flexible means to meet crises
in defensive situations and to launch surprise counterblows
The special characteristics of a motorized division make it
especially suitable for execution of delaying missions except
against armored units
In order to capitalize the mobility of the motorized division
close control of and coordination of combat teams
should be emphasized This involves both communication
means and technique and proper use of liaison agents within
the division and with other units

CAVALRY DIVISION
∎ 055 The cavalry division is a tactical and administrative
unit consisting of a division headquarters and headquarters

troop two brigades mechanized reconnaissance antitank
artillery engineer signal communication and service elements
Scout cars primarily for distant ground reconnaissance
motor trucks for supply and motorized elements for
command and signal communication purposes are all organically
assigned Specially equipped trucks are organically
contained in the division to transport a limited number of
horses men and equipment Its organization is such however
that it can continue to operate effectively without the
motor elements
The cavalry division may be assigned independent missions
which require operations far from other troops It may
constitute part of a cavalry corps ; it may be assigned or attached
to a corps an army or group of armies or it may be
held in general headquarters reserve
∎ 056 Cavalry is most effectively employed in those areas
where the terrain is definitely unfavorable to the operation
of mechanized units or in areas known to be free of hostile
mechanized forces If employed in areas where hostile
mechanized forces are likely to be encountered the cavalry
division should be strongly reinforced by mechanized and
antimechanized means
057 The primary mission of Cavalry is combat The
mobility of the cavalry divison permits it to extend the scope
of operation of less mobile ground troops and secure freedom
of action for them In a war of movement cavalry is
employed initially for surprise thrusts into enemy territory
for reconnaissance and for screening and covering other
forces Thereafter its most effective employment is in large
groups for swift and decisive action Its main strength
must not be dissipated through indiscriminate detachments
nor sacrificed through prolonged performance of missions
which can be performed more satisfactorily by other arms
f 058 Cavalry ordinarily executes reconnaissance in cooperation
with aviation Aviation locates the enemy at a
distance and orients the ground reconnaissance elements
thereby conserving their energy and speeding up their execution
of reconnaissance
059 The cavalry division executes reconnaissance for
larger units in accordance with instructions from the higher
2 58
OPERATIONS
059- 060
commander These instructions include all pertinent information
about the enemy and friendly troops the missions
of the larger units the intentions of the higher commander
the mission of the cavalry division expressed in terms of the
information required the area to be reconnoitered and the
cooperation and coordination between the cavalry division
reconnaissance aviation and other reconnaissance agencies
The higher commander assigns to the cavalry division a
zone of reconnaissance which ordinarily does not exceed 25
to 30 miles in width The cavalry division commander redistributes
this zone to reconnaissance detachments varying
in strength and composition according to the enemy opposition
expected and the relative importance of their missions
In distributing forces for reconnaissance and in assigning
missions the division commander estimates the relative importance
of factors affecting the mission of the division and
assigns greater strength and a more aggressive mission to
detachments operating in decisive zones
The cavalry division commander indicates the general axes
or zones for reconnaissance detachments within the division
zone of action and the lines to be reached at designated times
by elements of the detachment The distance between the
reconnaissance detachments and the main body of the division
varies with the situation ; at times it may become several
days' march Reconnaissance detachments are not responsible
for the immediate security of the division This must be
provided by the detail of the necessary covering forces
When reconnaissance detachments are operating at considerable
distance from the division or when secrecy considerations
necessitate radio silence the establishment of
advance message centers will facilitate the forwarding of
information and reduce the burden on the reconnaissance
elements Under such circumstances the protection of the
advance or relay stations devolves upon the division
commander
When the distance between the main opposing forces is
so reduced that the mobility of the cavalry cannot be utilized
the division should be rapidly shifted and depending upon the
situation directed against the enemy flanks or rear disposed
to protect a flank or placed in reserve
∎ 060 A cavalry division protects the disposition and action
of other ground forces by counterreconnaissance or
grlo
060- 062
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
screening which may be conducted either offensively or defensively
In executing a counterreconnaissance mission the
division seeks to defeat or neutralize enemy ground reconnaissance
forces
In the performance of counterreconnaissance the cavalry
division ascertains at the earliest practicable time the location
and activity of the enemy cavalry or other major ground
forces whose operations may jeopardize the main forces
A screening mission is most effectively accomplished by the
early defeat of the enemy ground reconnaissance forces The
dispositions of the division in offensive counterreconnaissance
are similar to those prescribed for reconnaissance Reconnaissance
detachments operate aggressively and locate the
main enemy forces to obtain information for the division
upon which it can base further operations In defensive
counterreconnaissance which is most effective when established
along a continuous obstacle patrols are pushed to the
front; and the division commander disposes his forces so as
to block the main routes of approach
When screening the concentration of large forces cavalry
divisions usually act defensively The screen utilizes available
obstacles to the maximum and is established at a sufficient
distance to the front to keep enemy ground reconnaissance
agencies from observing the location and disposition
of the forces being concentrated
• 06 Large bodies of horse cavalry usually maneuver
mounted and fight dismounted Cavalry uses the mobility
of its horses to gain the advantage of surprise against the
hostile flanks and rear from which dismounted fire attacks
can be employed effectively and decisively
Terrain may be the controlling factor Where concealment
exists for a dismounted advance losses are minimized
Conversely where there is no concealment or cover a quick
mounted dash from a concealed line of departure often results
in fewer losses
Long mounted advances against troops in position and
mounted attacks against prepared positions or against troops
in position and able to employ their combat power effectively
should not be made
•
062 The dispositions of the cavalry division for attack
usually include a pivot of maneuver about which the comoan
OPERATIONS
062- 065
mand operates a maneuvering mass charged with the main
attack and a reserve
As soon as contact is foreseen the division endeavors to
secure points of observation and to deny them to the enemy
In a meeting engagement the advance guard establishes the
pivot of maneuver In a more deliberately prepared attack
a special force may be detailed to establish it The pivot
of maneuver engages the enemy's attention and pins him to
his position by a fire attack or by a combination of fire attack
and maneuver
The maneuvering mass contains the main offensive power
and often constitutes the greater part of the division The
division commander assigns to the leader of this fraction the
accomplishment of the vital offensive action and allows him
sufficient liberty of action to take full advantage of the
developments of the situation He informs him of the general
plan the mission of the maneuvering mass and the duties of
the other elements of the division He usually specifies the
general location and the route thereto from which the attack
of the maneuvering mass is to be launched
• 063 The reserve is kept mounted or close to its horses
Its initial location depends upon its contemplated employment
The division commander uses the reserve promptly
to strike at a weak area in the hostile dispositions to push
through a success gained either by the pivot or the maneuvering
force or to pursue a defeated enemy Should the
attack fail the reserve may be employed to cover the reorganization
to assist in holding the position gained or in
occupying a rear position when a withdrawal follows
• 064 When a cavalry division is to be employed in the
exploitation of a break-through it is moved to the vicinity
of the main effort of the attack which is expected to break
through the enemy's defenses The breach should be sufficiently
wide to enable the cavalry division to pass through
without receiving severe fire from the flanks The mission
assigned the division on clearing the breach is clear-cut
aggressive and should be relentlessly carried out
• 065 When the cavalry division constitutes an encircling
force in pursuit it seeks to block the enemy retreat especially
at defiles and other critical areas ; it delivers attacks against
qRi
065- 069
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
the enemy flanks and carries out destruction on his lines of
retreat
• 066 When the cavalry division is acting alone it seeks
to destroy the hostile retreating force by direct pressure and
encircling pursuit (See ch 9 )
• 067 Cavalry divisions may be employed on the defensive
to seize and hold a position pending the arrival of other
forces to cover a withdrawal to delay the enemy's advance
or to fill a gap in the line of battle
068 Within the scope of its powers and limitations cavalry
operates in defensive combat the same as infantry
Due to organization and characteristics cavalry units
usually occupy comparatively broader fronts with less depth
than do corresponding infantry units
In defensive combat the position or area to be defended is
prepared for defense and occupied by a small proportion of
the available cavalry force consisting principally of horse
elements while the bulk of the command including the mechanized
elements by maneuver and threat or actual attack
endeavors to block or divert the enemy at a distance Even
when it is necessary for cavalry to defend a particular area or
position its best chance of success lies in initial dispositions in
advance of the final defense area In this manner inherent
mobility will be used to best advantage Against an enemy
strong in cavalry the division reserve should be large
• 069 In executing missions of delay the cavalry division
employs defensive tactics offensive tactics or a combination
of the two consisting of frontal delay and flank attack
It avoids decisive combat
Every effort is made to surprise the enemy by the choice of
delaying positions and by the forms of action used
The maximum amount of time is gained by forcing the
enemy to reconnoiter maneuver and deploy
The delaying force checks the enemy by bold and aggressive
action mounted and dismounted
It usually withdraws before suffering serious loss unless its
missions require more determined resistance
Surprise attacks delivered over previously reconnoitered
ground on the heads of hostile columns as they emerge from
defiles woods or villages have excellent chance of success

ARMORED DIVISION
ORGANIZATION
• 070 The armored division is the basic large armored unit
of the combined arms It comprises troops of the essential
arms and services so organized and equipped as to make it
tactically and administratively a self-contained unit capable
to a considerable extent of independent action
• 07 The armored division is a powerfully armed and
armored highly mobile force Its outstanding characteristics
are its battlefield mobility and its protected fire power
Other important characteristics are: extended radius of action;
shock power; logistical self-containment ; and great
sensitiveness to obstacles unfavorable terrain darkness and
weather
• 072 The armored division is organized primarily to perform
missions that require great mobility and firepower It is
given decisive missions It is capable of engaging in all forms
of combat but its primary role is in offensive operations
against hostile rear areas
073 Two or more armored divisions may be organized
into an armored corps (See FM 00- 5 )
9 074 The armored division consists fundamentally of five
echelons: command reconnaissance striking support and
service The component arms and services are organized
equipped and trained to operate within the division framework
in accordance with their tactical role When operating
separately or as part of an armored corps the division is reinforced
by the attachment of such additional arms and
services and by the' support of such aviation as the mission
and situation demand
• 075 The command echelon is organized and equipped for
great speed in the conduct of operations Plans must be simple
and flexible Rapidly changing situations require advance
planning preparation of terrain studies and close
contact with developments in forward areas in order to make
changes in the initial plan and expedite the announcement
of subsequent decisions and orders Maximum use is made of
075- 080
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
standing operating procedure air liaison and special prearranged
signals
• 076 The reconnaissance echelon performs ground reconnaissance
for the armored division If necessary it fights for
information It works in close cooperation with observation
aviation troops transported by air and supporting ground
units Its reconnaissance is characterized by fast bold aggressive
action and by prompt transmission of information
procured Success of armored operations depends largely on
prompt and aggressive exploitation of the results of reconnaissance
In many situations the reconnaissance echelon
seizes terrain objectives in advance of the division pending
the arrival of other elements Under certain conditions it
executes delaying missions During combat it may be assigned
reconnaissance or security missions or may be held
initially in division reserve to meet emergencies
• 077 The striking echelon is the main attack force of the
armored division It consists of tank regiments reinforced
as the situation requires by other elements organic to the
division Reconnaissance and heavy weapons elements are
included in the tank organizations
• 078 The support echelon consists of infantry carried in
armored vehicles It is reinforced by artillery and other
organic elements of the division in accordance with the
mission and tactical situation Its basic role is to support
closely the striking echelon by offensive or defensive action
A 079 The service echelon assures prompt supply evacuation
maintenance and administration of the division (See
FM 00- 0 )
• 080 The artillery components are organized and equipped
to render immediate controlled fire support to the various
elements of the division Timely support is facilitated by the
organization and equipment of armored artillery and the
transmission of information by radio
Once the attack is in progress the speed of the striking
force may make its support by artillery impracticable Combat
aviation must take over and execute the missions assigned
to artillery in more slowly moving operations
QCA
OPERATIONS
08 - 086
• 08 Engineer units facilitate the movement of the
armored division by removing or assisting in the passage of
obstacles and mine fields; by strengthening bridges ; and by
constructing repairing and maintaining crossings Demolitions
and natural and artificial obstacles are used to hinder
or canalize movements of hostile forces Engineers engage in
combat when necessary for the accomplishment of their
assigned work
• 082 The signal troops of the armored division are organized
for the rapid establishment and maintenance of signal
communication Because of its speed radio is the principal
means used but all practicable means are provided Effective
signal communication between armored units and supporting
artillery and combat aviation is vital in armored
operations
• 083 Combat aviation is employed against hostile aviation
to prevent air observation and attack of the division During
battle it is used for direct support of operations Its
missions include attacks on hostile command and supply
installations ; attacks on hostile reserves and formed bodies
of troops particularly hostile armored units ; attacks on
hostile antitank weapons artillery and other ground weapons ;
attacks on targets of opportunity and critical points in the
enemy position and the maintenance of air superiority in the
decisive areas
• 084 Observation aviation performs command reconnaissance
observation liaison and signal commu:nication
missions and cooperates closely with the division reconnaissance
echelon Air observation of artillery fire is necessary
if fire is to be delivered on targets which cannot be observed
from the ground Observation aviation maintains effective
liaison and coordination between the tanks artillery and
combat aviation
• 085 Troops transported by air may be employed in conjunction
with the operations of the armored division to land
in advance of it to secure terrain objectives on the routes of
march or to seize vital points in rear of the hostile front

execution and supervision of chemical operations They
are employed to supplement organic means of the division in
the execution of smoke missions during operations
RECONNAISSANCE
• 088 Speed of movement of the division and of the enemy
requires air and ground reconnaissance forces to operate at
great distances from the main body The distance at which
air reconnaissance operates is never less than the operating
range of hostile armored forces These distances at which the
division reconnaissance battalions operate are influenced by
the imminence of contact with hostile ground forces and the
characteristics of these forces Reconnaissance agencies of
lower units search the area intervening between the division
reconnaissance battalion and the main body When the
threat of hostile air attack is present air reconnaissance includes
the known location of the threat and is extended to
such distance as will afford the division and supporting pursuit
aviation ample warning of an air attack
When necessary the air reconnaissance effort is supported
by combat aviation ; ground reconnaissance units of the division
are given such additional support from other elements of
the division as the situation and mission demand
• 089 In conjunction with the execution of specific missions
all reconnaissance elements report information of terrain
roads signal communication facilities landing fields and supplies
observed Ground reconnaissance elements should include
engineer personnel whose mission is to determine the
condition of roads and bridges and furnish timely information
of any repairs or construction required Negative reports
must be submitted with the same promptness as is positive
information
SECURITY
• 090 Security depends largely on the efficacy of concealment
of supporting combat aviation and antiaircraft artillery
and of ground security detachments in preventing
discovery in bivouac and during movement
266
OPERATIONS
Timely warning from far reaching aggressive air and
ground reconnaissance is vital to protection against surprise
Natural barriers with their crossings or passes destroyed
or blocked and defended provide a high degree of
ground protection with economy of force for both the division
and its lines of communication Camouflage dispersion
concealment and high speed in movement combined
with the aggressive employment of combat aviation and
antiaircraft weapons afford the best security against air
attack
i 09 Precautions and protection against attack principally
against air attack are stressed during periods of refueling
and maintenance Congestion must be avoided Maximum
use is made of concealment and cover
∎ 092 In cooperation with large forces security may be
provided initially by other troops so that the armored operations
may come as a complete surprise to the enemy During
subsequent operations the superior commander may prescribe
security measures to be performed by other troops
for the protection of the combat elements of the division
the mobile supply base and the lines of communication In
all situations columns or groupings of the division are responsible
for their own local security
093 Bridges over unfordable streams passes through
mountains and other defiles are seized in advance of the
main body and protected against both ground and air attack
Existing natural barriers paralleling the direction of advance
are used to establish protected corridors for security of the
division and its lines of communication
094 Usually security detachments for daylight movements
are composed of tank units reinforced by other arms During
night movements during extended periods of tank maintenance
and refueling 'or when terrain is occupied for protection
infantry and machine guns are the principal component
Security detachments for the movement are smaller and operate
at greater distances between elements than for cavalry
or foot divisions
095 During movement frontal security is normally performed
by column advance guards

In proximity to hostile armored forces column advance
guards are stronger and operate at a greater distance from
the main body than when opposed by other hostile forces
Zones of responsibility are assigned by division to column
commanders
• 096 During movement flank security is provided where
practicable by utilizing natural and artificial obstacles protected
by detachments and by flank guards detailed by
column commanders
• 097 During long halts and in bivouac the division secures
itself principally by far reaching reconnaissance by skillful
use of terrain and natural and artificial barriers by depth of
disposition in the halt area by an outpost and by local security
measures In proximity to the enemy or behind the
enemy lines all around security is provided Infantry with
artillery antitank and engineer units constitutes the principal
element of the outpost
• 098 The area selected for a halt to assemble reorganize
rest or refuel should permit rapid communication with reconnaissance
elements and should provide natural terrain barriers
to hostile attack particularly in the presence of hostile
armored units The halt area may be utilized as a base for
the continuance of operations
• 099 Based on information received from its reconnaissance
and security agents the armored division dispatches troops
and combat aviation if available to destroy a known potential
hostile threat before that threat can become a real danger
to the division
MARCHES
• 00 The armored division normally marches ip multiple
columns to facilitate readiness for action and protection
against hostile air and armored force attack In the presence
of hostile aviation secrecy surprise and protection are favored
by night marches When tactical considerations govern
march columns are constituted in accordance with the
probable employment of the striking and support echelons in
combat Mobility is exploited to achieve surprise

of darkness when the situation is obscure when the plan of
maneuver contemplates the commitment of the infantry prior
to the tanks and when the employment of the tanks cannot
be reasonably foreseen infantry is placed in the lead
OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS
• 02 Tactical operations of the armored division are characterized
by bold maneuvers executed at high speed to create
a preponderance of power in the decisive area Combat action
is further characterized by the maximum coordination possible
initially followed by decentralization of means and reliance
upon the initiative of subordinates
Operations are predicated upon deliberate detailed planning
and rapid aggressive execution Completeness of plans
is limited only by the time available
The timely personal influence of the commander must be
exerted in all operations He must have at his disposal various
means of rapid transportation and signal communication
to enable him to exert this influence
• 03 All armored force attacks contemplate the rapid
transfer of shock power and protected fire power into the
vital part of the hostile rear area from an unexpected direction
The attack is launched in mass in a decisive direction
with such speed and violence that the enemy is afforded no
time or opportunity to organize and 'coordinate his reaction
before the armored attack mission is accomplished Such
attacks produce early hostile demoralization and decisive
results
• 04 The mobility of the armored division permits great
latitude in the choice of direction and method of attack
Whether the attack will be executed as a turning movement
envelopment or penetration will be largely determined by
the hostile dispositions and organization of the ground the
terrain the time factor and lines of communication within
the hostile area
• 05 Four conditions should be present or be created for
successful offensive action : air superiority surprise favorable
terrain and the absence or neutralization of massed enemy
defensive means
269
06- 0
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
06 In order to obtain surprise all preparatory movements
are carefully concealed and measures are taken to prevent
hostile ground and air observation of the division The
mobility of the armored division is exploited to keep the enemy
in doubt as long as possible as to the area of its employment
Radio often is silenced prior to the attack After the attack
is launched the element of surprise may be retained by sustained
speed and power
5 07 Areas favorable for attack are determined from the
information obtained by map study from reconnaissance
agencies from higher and adjacent units and from troops
already in contact with the enemy
Armored units can be employed on comparatively rough
terrain Localities with heavy timber high boulders and
stumps steep slopes marshes deep or muddy bottom streams
and streams with abrupt banks are however obstacles to
armored vehicle operations Defended towns or cities are
avoided
08 Ground antitank measures include natural and artificial
obstacles demolitions strongly organized localities
mine fields antitank weapons artillery and armored units
The attack is planned so as to neutralize blind or overcome
the hostile antitank defenses in the zone of attack and to
strike at defensive weakness
• 09 In attack the combat elements of the armored division
generally are disposed into three parts : a striking
force (striking echelon) a supporting force (support echelon)
and a reserve
• 0 When the initial terrain is unfavorable for tank operations
or when hostile antitank defenses are strong the
support echelon of the armored division may attack in advance
of the striking force to secure ground favorable for
the initiation of the tank attack If operating in close cooperation
with other troops the entire armored division
may be held out until the difficult zone has been taken by
other troops or has been disrupted by artillery and air attack
When conditions permit the striking echelon to lead the
attack the support echelon follows the striking force to occupy
and hold objectives seized by the striking force

Reserves are employed to protect the flanks of the
attack and to maintain its continuity and direction
• 2 Except when the attack is launched by passing
through foot troops already in position the division as a
whole usually assumes attack formations directly from march
columns Ordinarily a short halt is necessary for subordinate
units to designate objectives on the ground
• 3 Zones of action and a line of departure often are
prescribed for coordination Attacking tank units are disposed
in approach march formation when they cross the
line of departure As soon as resistance is encountered by
covering detachments the leading tank waves assume attack
formations
• 4 Prominent terrain features may be designated as
phase lines to coordinate the effort of all troops including
supporting combat aviation
• 5 The depth and frontage of the initial combat formation
depend primarily upon known hostile dispositions and
characteristics the terrain and distance to the objective
The attack of the striking force must be organized and
launched with sufficient depth to insure sustained striking
power It is delivered on the minimum frontage necessary
to overcome resistance to its advance
• 6 The attack is rapid deep and sustained until the
decision is won It is characterized by the employment of
the striking echelon in mass in a series of waves by rapid
concentrations of artillery heavy machine-giin and Combat_
aviation fire on critical objectives and by proper timing in
the engagement of reserves
• 7 Each subordinate tank unit in the attack is assigned
a direction and one principal objective Suitable objectives
are those hostile elements or installations the destruction of
which will disrupt most effectively the enemy operation

In an obscure situation the main attack is launched in a
deep column of deployed tank units This formation is
flexible is easy to control during laten deployment and
makes available the means with which to meet unforeseen
contingencies

in armored personnel carriers It remains mobile
as long as the situation permits When assigned the mission
of following the striking echelon it follows closely; prepared
to overcome the remaining hostile resistance in the areas over
which the tanks have passed to occupy and hold the ground
gained or to cover the reorganization of tank units during
the course of the attack Prior to the attack by the striking
echelon it may be used to develop the enemy situation with a
secondary attack supported by artillery combat aviation
engineers and when necessary by some of the tanks
• 20 The attack of the armored division requires careful
coordination of the supporting fires of the artillery heavy
infantry weapons including mortars and combat aviation
to prevent concentration of hostile mobile antitank weapons
in the zone chosen for the offensive and to neutralize enemy
weapons dangerous to the attack
At times preparatory fires may be omitted in order to
attain surprise
• 2 The artillery covers the development of the division
It may be employed to neutralize hostile rear defenses until
the engagement of the tanks or to concentrate on areas secure
from tank attack In support of the division attack
the artillery fires are directed to the neutralization of the
antitank defense and artillery which constitute the greatest
threat to the advance Frequently small artillery units are
pushed forward prior to the attack in order to deliver direct
fire on targets of opportunity Prearranged signals and
messages are used to facilitate cooperation between the tanks
and supporting weapons

24 In an enveloping attack by the division acting alone
against an enemy in position the support echelon may attack
to fix the enemy front while the striking echelon makes the
main attack In cooperation with other large unarmored
units the entire armored division is employed to make or
lead the enveloping attack while other units hold the enemy
in position
When the direction of the envelopment has been determined
the striking echelon preceded by its reconnaissance
units and covering detachments develops and maneuvers
rapidly to launch its attack Elements of the support echelon
not required for the secondary attack follow the striking
echelon closely
25 The armored division penetrates an enemy position
on a narrow front and then extends to attack the enemy rear
in order to destroy his defense and exploit the success
26 In penetrations of organized positions in cooperation
with other large units of the combined arms the zone of the
initial break-through may be neutralized or breached by
other troops The armored division is then employed to continue
the attack and complete and exploit the hostile disruption
It is followed immediately by other highly mobile
units to extend widen or hold the breach Motorized divisions
are especially suitable for this purpose

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
4 27 Delay in launching the armored division through a
neutralized zone or a breach affords the enemy time in which
to organize and coordinate countermeasures and may result
in a serious reverse
The shoulders of the gap must be held securely either by
troops of the support echelon or by other troops The passage
of the armored division through the breach must be
effectively protected against antitank gun fire and hostile air
and ground reaction Once the breach has been effected the
enemy must not be permitted to close it Flank attacks continue
to widen the breach
Hostile counterattacks against the flanks of the penetration
are met by combat aviation by reserves and by the fire of
artillery antiaircraft artillery and antitank weapons
28 When forward progress of attacking units is stopped
by hostile resistance fire of artillery and combat aviation is
concentrated on the resistance and flanking movements are
initiated at once
Elements of the support echelon reinforced by combat
aviation artillery and engineers may be employed to advance
the attack beyond terrain obstacles or ground unfavorable
for tank action
29 Some reorganization of assault units is often necessary
after each tank objective is overrun The leading waves
may be passed through by other tank units Every effort
must be made to maintain the continuity and speed of the
attack
30 If the tank attack is unsuccessful initially the advance
elements of the support echelon strong in machine
guns and antitank guns immediately establish a position
behind which the tanks withdraw and reorganize for further
effort The supporting artillery and combat aviation protect
the reorganization
∎ 3 When the armored division has passed through the
hostile organized resistance its ground reconnaissance elements
are dispatched at once toward the objective These
elements working in close cooperation with the air reconnaissance
report hostile reserves and artillery hostile command
and supply installations and unfavorable terrain
Appropriate targets are attacked
i
OPERATIONS
32- 36
8 32 The division must provide flank protection Flank
protection is aided by the speed of the advance the utilization
of natural barriers on the flank and by the support of
combat aviation
8 33 When the striking echelon captures its objective
the necessary reorganization is initiated at once under the
protection of the support echelon artillery and combat
aviation
Reorganization and consolidation of the objective are limited
to the essentials An advance to a second objective or
exploitation of the success is begun without delay Exploitation
often will be executed in close cooperation with other
highly mobile troops which have been moved close behind
the armored division in its attack
Extended exploitation may be initiated immediately after
passage of the hostile organized resistance without waiting
for reorganization or consolidation of the objective This is
particularly true in attacks against inferior hostile troops
and against troops weak in aviation and mechanized units
34 The armored division may be employed to exploit its
own success and the successes of other troops by rapid attacks
from the rear to overrun the hostile artillery to destroy reserves
and command and supply establishments to break up
hostile counterattacks and to block strong reserves moving to
restore the battle position or to occupy rear positions
n 35 In exploiting a break-through the armored division is
effectively employed to operate at great distances in the
hostile rear areas to block routes of hostile movement to
attack strategic reserves and to seize vital areas In such
operations the division normally constitutes a part of a
larger armored force which is closely followed by other mobile
units such as motorized divisions Since the purpose of these
operations is the complete destruction of the enemy by placing
a powerful striking force in his rear the division moves
through the area of the break-through at the greatest possible
speed Troops transported by air may be suitably employed
in advance of the armored divisions Opportunities for
decisive exploitation by armored forces must be created
36 Before directing exploitation or pursuit the commander
of the armored division must assure the required
36- 4
FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
supply of ammunition and motor fuel in combat elements
His plan must include provision for both supply and motor
maintenance during the subsequent operations Normally
little dependence should be placed on procuring motor fuel
locally
It 37 Once undertaken pursuit must be boldly pushed
with the utmost vigor and ruthlessness Acting alone the
division organizes all combat elements for pursuit by direct
pressure and by encirclement A strong encircling force is
provided The tank units with the direct pressure force seek
to pass through gaps which the attack may have opened in
the hostile dispositions or to gain the rear of the enemy's
covering force in order to attack the withdrawing hostile
elements The encircling force moves to strike the heads
of the retreating columns by placing itself across the line of
retreat on terrain favorable for its operation
i 38 In a pursuit when operating with large forces the
armored division reinforced with highly mobile units is normally
employed as an encircling force
• 39 In all pursuit operations combat aviation acting in
conjunction with the pursuing armored units materially assists
in obtaining decisive results
DEFENSIVE OPERATIONS
• 40 The employment of the armored division on a defensive
position seriously restricts the use of its mobility and
should be resorted to only in emergency
A 4 Opposed to greatly superior armored forces the division
avoids decisive combat if its mission permits such action
If its mission requires it to gain time it either occupies
terrain unfavorable for hostile tank attacks or employs
delaying tactics When a position must be defended by the
division against superior hostile armored troops every advantage
is taken of obstacles to protect the position and
restrict the direction of the hostile attack
The position selected should afford room for maneuver
suitable terrain for counterattacks and concealed routes of
withdrawal The units of the support echelon organize defense
areas disposed in depth so as to take full advantage of
276
OPERATIONS
4 - 44
obstacles The tank units prepare plans for counterattacks
and for ambush against hostile tank units
∎ 42 When the terrain is favorable the armored division
either alone or in cooperation with other forces may be employed
in counterattack The characteristics of the armored
division may justify assigning it objectives considerably
deeper or further to a flank than those whose capture would
be necessary merely to restore the defensive position
43 When a large force reinforced by armored divisions
passes from the defensive to the offensive the armored divisions
may be employed rapidly to envelop a hostile flank or
to form the spearhead of a penetration of a weak portion
of the hostile front
0 44 In delaying action against less mobile forces the
support echelon operates against the heads of the advancing
enemy units while the tanks threaten or attack the hostile
flanks and rear Against hostile armored troops every effort
is made to locate each delaying position behind a formidable
natural obstacle Tank units protect the flanks and execute
local counterattacks
277

FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
When tanks are employed in an attack intensive reconnaissance
to discover antimechanized defenses must be
initiated promptly and must be continued throughout the
tank action
When necessary engineer troops with suitable equipment
are attached to tank units to assist their advance Mine fields
and serious obstacles must be destroyed before the tank
attack is launched Their destruction must be accomplished
at the last possible moment in order not to warn the enemy
of the impending attack

Training Circular WAR DEPARTMENT
No 3
Wa ;;hington May 6 94
Employment of larger armored units -- Purpose and
scope --Pendingthe publication of pertinent doctrine
in FM 00- 5 the broad policies governing the employment
of large components of the Armored Force independently
or in combined operations are announced herein
This publication supplements the doctrine announced in
Training Circular No 4 War Department 940 which has
particular application to the armored division and GHQ
tank battalions and pertinent paragraphs of Training
Circular No 0 War Department 940 See also Training
Circular No 0 War Department 94
2 Methods of employing elements of the Armored
Force --Operations of components of the Armored Force
may at various times or simultaneously involve--
-
a The attachment of GHQ tank battalions and groups
to infantry cavalry and armored divisions or corps
b The grouping of'armored-divisions corps or GHQ
tank groups with other corps or field armies for combined
operations
c The employment by the field or theater commander
of armored divisions and corps on independent or
se-ii -independent missions without reinforcing logistical
means or additional supporting troops other than reconnaissance
aviation
d Operation as task forces wherein armored divisions
or corps or at times GHQ tank units are teamed
with motorized divisions antitank battalions antiaircraft
automatic weapons battalions and GHQ engineer
maintenance and supply units closely supported by combat
aviation parachute and other troops transported by
air
3 General considerations --Larger units of the
Armored Force properly utilized either separately or
in combination with other means can achieve rapid decisive
results in the area of employment They are to
be employed on decisive missions They must not be
frittered away on unimportant objectives Missions far
in advance of other main forces are justified when the
operation will obtain decisive results but should be
closely supported by other equally mobile troops (see
par 4) Proper utilization necessitates definite appre
;iation and careful consideration of the following :
'I'C 3
-2-
a Those conditions which should exist or be created
for successful action ; such as air superiority in the
decisive area of employment surprise favorable terrain
and absence of or neutral :izat-on of massed defensive
means
b The mobility of armored units permits great latitude
in choice of direction and method of attack Decision
as to whether the attack will be executed as a
turning movement envelopment or penetration will be
largely determined by the time factor involved and by
terrain and hostile_ dispositions including rear installations
The most suitable areas for employment are on
open flanks or through existing gaps created by penetrations
c The assignment of missions or objectives to ar--
mored units must be preceded by a careful consideration
of the more important factors affecting operation of
the armored and other units associated in the operations
These factors are : weather ; terrain throughout the -
entire area of contemplated operation; nature of the
enemy and his methods of combat; availability of other
supporting troops; and especially adequate space and
road net for the operation of the units concerned The
axis of advance of major armored and motorized units
will be along roads
do Most decisive results will be gained from the
grouping of overpowering masses of armored units and
launching them against vital objectives deep in the
hostile rear The armored mass must be supported by
sufficient means to maintain momentum until attainment
of the objective
c Most effective and decisive application of the
mobility and power of large armored and motorized combii;
ations will often sceessitate uecentral :iza{„ion of
control to the appropriate commanders who will be guided
only by the broad general plan of the higher headquarters
After the initiation of - the- operation however -
the superior commander must keep armored unit commanders
constantly informed of the situation
f Maximum development of the demoralizing power of
larger armored 'formations will be dependent in a large
measure on continuous support of adequate reconnaissance
and observation aviation and timely assistance of combat
aviation in overcoming critical ground resistance
N yond the ability of available artillery This should
-3 --
TC 3
be assured by direct arrangement between air and armored
unit commanders and by adequate air-ground signal communication
nets Higher commanders can enhance the effectivenesS
of supporting aviation by habitually assigning
the same components to operational teams or task
units
F Sustained mobility of armored and motorized
units is dependent upon adequate timely replenishment
of required supplies especially fuel and to a lesser
degree oil and lubricants Regular vehicle maintenance
must be continued When operations are to be prolonged
for several days it must be appreciated that armored
and motorized units must have opportunity for daily
maintenance See also paragraph 8d
h Because of their mass employment armored and
motorized units are difficult to conceal during approach
and development Elaborate measures for deception and
surprise will often be required and may involve variously:
advance stockage and concealment of essential supplies
; improvising and concentrating dummy_ armored vehicles
or marked activity of actual units in localities
distant from that of contemplated employment ; extensive
camouflage work; and rapid shifting of armored masses
to the area of decisive attack
4 A task force is a temporary tactical grouping
composed of one or more arms or services formed - for a
specific mission or operation The operation of large
armored formations will frequently dictate the organization
of task forces The composition of such forces
should be decided only after careful estimate of the
associated means required to accomplish the projected
mission or opcratian This estimate must consider the
nature of the expected resistance the distance to which
operations are projected the terrain to be traversed
and the troops available for the operation The additional
means to be associated with armored elements
will vary with each situation but may comprise appropriately:
infantry divisions foot or motorized or
components thereof ; cavalry units ; engineers ; combat
aviation ; parachute troops ; other troops transported by
air ; antitank battalions ; antiaircraft units ; and additional
maintenance and supply facilities especially
for GHQ tank groups
5 Methods of operation --a Offensive operations
of armored units acting either alone or as part of a
combined force are characterized by rapid thrusts into
vital parts of the hostile rear followed by immediate
exploitation to complete energy demoralization Armored
division commanders coordinate and control the movement
of subordinate units by appropriate assignment of
routes zones objectives or phase lines Phase lines
are prescribed only when required to insure coordinated
action or movement of two or more units and must not
involve prolonged halts thereon The attack is massed
initially but is extended promptly in frontage and
depth by the armored reconnaissance and combat elements
after the hostile position is penetrated As the operation
gains momentum reconnaissance agencies should
precede combat elements at the earliest opportunity to
seek out and develop soft spots through which combat
elements may pass rapidly The more time allowed for
this reconnaissance the more effective it will be
Contact once gained must be maintained
b PSaximum advantage is taken of speed and terrain
barriers to prevent or neutralize enemy countermeasures
Reconnaissance agencies provide information on which to
base security measures Other combat detachments provide
immediate advance flank and rear security
Closely supporting motorized units protect the immediate
rear and lines of communication of the armored elements
Other motorized units should relieve the armored
unit commanders of concern for extended lines of communication
and assure continuous logistical support'
When armored units are operating as task forces the
security of the immediate supporting motorized elements
will be c !ha iced by t?heix fotlowiuug the armored combat
elements as closely as possible
c Following the advance of armored units other
elements of task- forces (see par 4) operate to overcome
remaining hostile resistance occupy ground gained
keep gaps open extend and protect the flanks and relieve
armored units temporarily checked in order to permit
their employment in a more remunerative direction
Whenever practicable other less mobile troops should
follow motorized task units as closely as possible to
wipe out the last vestige of resistance meet counterattacks
and relieve the more mobile elements for close
support of the armored units
d ' In addition to establishing and maintaining local
control of the air supporting combat aviation is
-5-
TC 3
directed against hostile antitank dispositions artillery
and reserves especially armored in the immediate
zone of advance Concurrently if available aviation
suffices it may be directed against hostile command
and supply installations targets of opportunity such
as more distant reserves and other formed bodies of
troops - _espeeially_armored units
e ; In an envelopment the support units of armored_
divisions and task forces nay when the situation - demands
attack or contain enemy elements on the flank~
while armored units make-the' main attack
f Troops transported by air may be suitably employed
in advance of armored units to seize critical
points-or to create opportunity for_ ismediate exploitation
- by armored forces operating alone or as task forces
g Highly organized areas should be avoided l;There
their attack is necessary it will usually be advisable
for other specially equipped infantry and engineer
-
troops to breach the - enemy defenses in advance or con
currently with the advance of- the armored units-unless
heavy tanks are available to lead the attack --_
h : Against equal-or superior hostile armored forces
friendly armored-units _will avoid frontal assault and
maneuver tcoutf•off or destroy enemy armored unit supply-
facilities followed by blows against the rear of
enemy detachments
6 Exploitation and ou_rLarge armored
formations operating separately or as part of task
forces are especially suited for exploitation and pursuit
They should be launched boldly against vital
areas deep in the hostile rear The exploitation and
pursuit Phase must be anticipated to insure that appropriate
playa arc made :ir-a timely
ors issued in ?
echelons There must be no relaxing of pressure on the
shaken or beaten enemy Objectives-for armored units
should be those which will halt hostile rearward lovem_
ent until less mobile friendly troops can close with
the enemy Concurrently some armored elements_operate
to destroy disrupt and paralyze enemy c0imii unication__
and supply
V
b Pursuit by large armored units operating alone
or as major elements of task forces is rapid and continuous
even during hours of darkness
c When the operations of armored units are likely
to carry them beyond practicable operating radius of
organic supply means special- provision must be made by the
higher commanders to place necessary supplies within operating
radius of the units - Likewise special arrangements
must be made by higher headauartors for rapid communication
with the widely dispersed elements of armored
formations
7 - Defensive situations --Large armored units as--
part'of other major forces on the defensive are held
in readiness for the counteroffensive or majorc;
ounter-attack The eiaployment of the armored units must be
carefully timed and coordinated with the attack objectives
of the other forces Local air superiority during
the period - of the counteroffensive or major counterattack
is a prerequisite to success of the operations
Usually the armored attack should bedelivered to disrupt
the continuity of the hostile offensive and not
merely to restore the defensive position
8 Logistical considerations :-a' Where prolonged_
operations of armored divisions and corps or GHQ tank
units_ are contemplated adequate arrangements must be
made by the higher headquarters to insure timely re
plenishment of supplies 'required by the armored' units
Where the armored units are required to operate at
great distances from their base of supplies when'continuity
of supply is interrupted by eneuW action - and
in other emergency situations delivery of urgent supplies
may be_made by air
b As - a general guide to the logistical capabilities
of armored divisions the following -expressed in terms
of days of supply are the maximum supplies carried
organically:
Class --3 days (including one "D" ration) in units
plus day in -ouartermpster battalion
Anmuuuition_: 2 days! supply of small arms 37-mm
60-mm mortar ; day's supply 8 -mm mortar 05-mss
howitzer and 75--pan AT guns -
Gasoline and oil : 2 days' supply
In addition the quarteiuraster battalion of the
armored division can carry 20 tons of ammunition or
gasoline and oil (over and above the norral division
reserve of day's supply of Class I -- 40 tons)
c The following are the approximate tonnages of
day's supply of the indicated items for an armored division
:
Ammunition all class 600 tons
-7-
TC 3
tlasoli ne and oil- (assumed average operating
distance - 00 miler
220 tons
Class 40 tons
d Where several armored divisions or GIIQ tank
units are under control of one headquarters consideration
should be given to retaining one or more division
or GHQ tank units in reserve either for the purpose of
extending combat operations or of relieving similar
units to permit necessary maintenance and replacement
operations In this manner continuity of the operation
and necessary maintenance rest and replacement will
be assured

GENERAL
∎ 77 The strategic offensive retains the initiative ; it permits
the highoermc'manderto direct his movements and employ
his forces in a decisive effort in accordance with his plans
Its psychological advantage is great ; it provides a powerful
stimulus to the war efforts of both the civil and military
components of the nation Initiated with surprise and
energetically followed through it throws the opponent off
balance and on the defensive from which he may be unable
to change until decisively defeated or until the accomplishment
of the mission assigned the forces initiating the offensive
has been achieved
∎ 78 The strategic offensive demands great initial impetus
continuity of effort and flexible dispositions so that its culmination
in battle will find the offensive force capable of
launching decisive destructive blows against the enemy
forces For decisive results in modern warfare it is essential
that the offensive forces have air superiority in the areas of
decisive operations Combat aviation and motorization have
increased striking power both for the offensive and defensive
forces but the offensive force still has the advantage of in-

The defender on the other - hand must concounteract
form not only to the general movements but must Pared to meet the many capabilities of his" opponent This may tend to disperse the defender and weaken him at areas which are or lead to decisive strategic objectives of the attacker
7 79 The Maintenance of routes of communication in hos- tile territory presents numerous difficulties Large rein- forcements in personnel munitions and equipment must be kept moving forward It may be necessary to employ con• siderable forces in investing or contain+ ng fortresses or large fortlfled areas and holding and exploiting the occupied areas of enemy territory The inhabitants as Well as parachute troops can be expected to interfere with the gaining and transmitting of information and with the maintenance of supply lines as well as to engage in guerilla operations Care- ful estimate of the situation will enable the commander to foresee many of the difficulties which may be encountered and provide for timely measures to meet them effectively without diminishing unduly the power of or resources re- quired for his decisive movements
! 80 Whether the strategic offensive can be initiated in all theaters at the same time will depend upon many factors among which are the mission of the armed'forces the relative strengths of friendly and enemy forces terrain lines of com- munication and defensive or other strategic requirements in certain areas With Inadequate forces the strategic offen- sive should rarely be undertaken in secondary theaters When such an offensive is necessary it must be launched with boldness rapidity and surprise The assumption of the strategic defensive in one or more theaters may permit the decision to be reached in the primary area of operations For the doctrines concerning main and secondary attacks see FM 00-5

∎ 8 Strategic offensive maneuvers have for their purposea
Forcing the enemy to accept combat under co nditions
favorable to the attacker
b Forcing the enemy to abandon his will to contin ue warlike
operations by occupying or seriously threaten ing_his vital
areas
Since the second contingency will rarely be achieved without
battle the culmination of the offensive maneuver will
ordinarily find the opponent ceasing to maneuver and taking
position from which to receive the attack in an area most
favorable to him and in accord with his strategic requirements
When this condition is reached offensive operations
will be continued to gain tactical success by break-through
envelopment or turning I:aovement
U 82 Offensive operations on interior lines consist of maneuvers
from a central location against enemy forces advancing
along convergent lines or against enemy forces of two allied
countries which are separated by the common opponent of
both The advantage of interior lines is increased as the
distance separating the converging or otherwise separated
hostile forces is increased Time and space initially favor
forces operating on interior lines This advantage is at the
maximum when the separated forces can be struck and defeated
in detail before one can come to the assistance of the
other This necessary delay of separated forces may be
gained by employing against one or more of them small
highly mobile forces whose primary mission is delay yet
which can strike hard offensive blows against an overanxious
or rash enemy
THE EkEAK-THROUGH
83 The strategic break-through may consist of a decisive
blow launched in one area or of penetrations with decisive
blows launched in two or more areas The purpose of both
is an advance deep into hostile territory to encircle and destroy
or capture large hostile forces or to seize strategically
important areas
r 84 Break-through operations launched in one area have
for their primary objective the separation of the enemy's
forces into two parts followed by the envelopment or encircle-
3 3
84-86 FIELD SERVICE REGULATIONS
ment and defeat or rated destruction of one or both of the sepa- parts
A 85 Break-through operations launched in two or more areas will ordinarily envisage the function of the highly mo- bile leading elements of each penetrating force in rear of the hostile rear areas or other objective They further provide for the closing of the pincers thus formed and annihilation or capitulation of the forces surrounded or the capture or investment of the strategic objective encircled The break- through forces must be prepared to meet enemy counterat- tacks from the encircled enemy forces as well as from those outside the encirclements The maintenance of strong pres- sure on the hostile front between as well as on areas outside and adjacent to the areas of penetration tends to fix the enemy In those areas and restrict maneuver of his forward elements

∎ 87 It is essential that the offensive forces have air
superiority and that this air superiorit is maintained
t roug tout t to operation Combat aviation not only assists
the break-through operations by attacks against hostile
ground forces in contact but by attacks against large enemy
reserves which may be employed to assist the defender and
y pro- ng pursuitProtection over the area of operations
(See ch 7 ) Aviation has a major function of gaining
and transmitting impo taut information prior to the initiation
of the operation and of reporting events on the field
of battle as well as those distant from the scene of operations
which may eventually influence the outcome of the
operations It must exert every effort to gain and transmit
this information Air superiority itself is a tremendous
factor in preventintfte enemy from gaining timely information
It may prove decisive In gaining surprise over the
enemy
N 88 Modern means of combat have placed in the hands
of the higher commender weapons of speed and striking
power which permit h+m to plan well in advance and employ
these means decisively in the break-through and subsequent
encirclement and effectively to meet changes in the situation
A 89 A break-through operation launched with insufficient
striking and exploiting force runs the grave risk of failing to
break through the hostile defensive areas and of merely
bending the hostile front This in turn may subject the
attacking force to strong enemy counterattacks or to a hostile
counteroffensive
90 When terrain and other conditions permit large armored
formations may be effectively and decisively employed
as the leading elements of the task forces employed in the
break-through operations They are capable of thrusting
themselves into and through the hostile dispositions as a
wedge and in such formation as to assure protection initially
of their own flanks This wedge formation also furnishes
some security to the flanks of the other ground elements
which are following the armored formations The armored
formations open the why for the timely advance of other
ground troops which widen the breach and strike the flanks

and rear which have been maintained exposed Pressure is continuously on the hostile front between and adjacent to the areas of break-through Missions assigned the armored formations will be governed by the object
to be attained In one situation they may constitute an element of the en- circlement force whose task
major hostile to envelop and destroy a force In another they may be assigned stra- tegic area objectives for the Purpose of destroying hostile lines of communication blocking movement of large reserves or capturing facilities vital to the opposing force while the encirclement and destruction of the forward hostile elements is assigned to other ground units Against a retreating force they may be employed to gain the rear or flank of this force and block its retreat while less mobile elements advance to complete the destruction or cause the surrender of the enemy In whatever maneuver the components of the break-through forces are employed the forces must be so organized and of sufficient strength to execute a complete break-through and the plans must be so flexible that full advantage can be taken by mobile hard-striking forces of changes in the situation favorable to the friendly forces This also requires a thoroughly adequate signal communication system (See also ch 9 )
If 9 The selection of the area or areas for the break- through will be Influenced strongly by the objective (whether enemy forces or vital areas) by the suitability of terrain throughout the area for operations by the forces to be employed by dispositions of the hostile forges including large reserves and the time required to move adequate forces to the area In some situations it may be desirable to select an area in which terrain is less favorable when by so doing combat intelligence Indicates less hostile resistance is to be expected and surprise as to direction and intensity of the advance and attack is gained When the opposing forces are composed of armies of two or more allied nations the area at which such armies make contact along their front may be particularly suitable for the break-through This consideration also applies though to a lesser degree to the area of contact between two armies It is in these areas that coordination and cooperation are often weakest and

where national jealousies or conflicting aims weaken the
opponent Large salients along the opposing fronts may offer
especially favorable areas for the break-through since in
these areas exposed hostile flanks already exist
9 92 Full advantage must be taken of all means to deceive
the opposing commander With plentiful lateral routes of
communication and modern means of combat and transportation
it may under certain conditions be feasible to
build up a strong force in one area attack with a part of this
force follow this attack with the secret movement of the
mass of the assembled force to the area where the decisive
effort is to be made and strike in that area Such an operation
requires that forces sufficient to effect a strong continuing
blow be employed in the area of initial concentration
Otherwise there will be little deception since the enemy
may be able to block the original attack with minimum forces
and meet effectively the forces intended for the decisive
effort and the advantages of mobility will be lost
THE ENVELOPMENT
p 93 The enveloping maneuver may be initiated off the field
of battle after contact has been gained ; or it may be the
decisive action following the break-through
0 94 The strategic objective the terrain the relative
strengths of opposing forces and the enemy situation may
be such as not only to Indicate but to make advantageous
the Initiation of movements off the battlefield by the enveloping
forces - Such movements will often facilitate the surprise
execution of the envelopment simultaneously with or following
the fixation of the hostile forces by those friendly forces
which make contact frontally This maneuver should not
ordinarily contemplate the movement of the two component
parts beyond mutually supporting distance (See FM 00-5 )
However the size of each should be such that it can maintain
itself against the enemy It is highly desirable that the
enveloping forces move secretly and strike with surprise
∎ 95 An envelopment may be'the result of an advance so
planned and executed as to be in sufficient width to extend
beyond one or both flanks of the hostile forces In such an

are essential to the successful execution of such a maneuver 0 96 After contact has been gained and the hostile forces have been developed an enveloping maneuver may be exe- cuted by troops on the battlefield When the maneuver aims to strike the hostile flank well in Its rear It is preferable to employ for the envelopment reserve or other mobile elements not in close contact with the enemy Such a maneuver requires thorough reconnaissance careful planning excellent staff work suitable security measures and the exercise of great Initiative by all commanders Great freedom of action must ordinarily be granted to subordinate com- manders since a capable enemy will not remain idle while the offensive force maneuvers It must be expected that the opposing commander will take suitable measures including offensive action to counter the planned maneuver 0 97 Air naval and land force superiority may permit deci- sive results to be gained by an envelopment by air-borne and sea-borne troops of an enemy one or both of whose flanks rests on navigable waters The existence of suitable landing beaches inlets or other waters favoring the movement of small landing boats along and In'rear of the hostile flank provide suitable areas from which to launch an envelopment or turning movement against the hostile rear combat elements and lines of communication Maximum results are to be ex- pected when the maneuver can be launched with surprise ; when the envelopments by sea-borne and air-borne troops car strike simultaneously and when the objective Is of such nature that its capture makes the position of the defender untenable and at the same time blocks the retreat of part or all of the hostile forces

capture decisive strategic areas When his mission and a
careful estimate of the situation have caused the commander
to decide upon both the strategic and tactical offensive he
must employ all means at his disposal to drive through boldly
and energetically to the objective Under special conditions
strategic requirements may demand a tactical offensive when
the calculated risks indicate only a fair chance of success
The commander must not however rush headlong into enemy
traps
TURNING MOVEMENT
0 99 Lines of communication and the maintenance of adequate
supply to the combatant forces are of vital importance
in modern operations The requirements in munitions equipment
food and motor fuel can be satisfied only from the zone
of the interior or other suitable supply bases To deprive
the field commander of essential supplies reduces his otherwise
effective army to the status of a force equipped only with
primitive means of combat Consequently no field commander
can afford to sacrifice his lines of communication
He must meet a threat to these vital lines Meeting this
threat may draw him from an otherwise advantageous position
and force him to maneuver in conformity with the plan
of his opponent This may be accomplished by the turning
movement or maneuver wherein the final defeat or destruction
of the hostile forces is achieved or aided by directing a
suitable proportion of the offensive forces deep against the
hostile rear the hostile lines of communication or specifically
against the sources of enemy supply The commander of
the forces comprising the turning movement seeks by surprise
deception and rapidity of movement to avoid hostile
defenses of major organized forces in order to strike his
objective rapidly and decisively
0 00 For large forces the turning movement is frequently
executed in conjunction with the frontal advance It is
particularly suited to highly mobile hard-striking components
such as large armored formations strongly reinforced
by combat aviation and other suitable means Its objective
may be at a great distance from the field of battle on which
the forces in the frontal advance initially engage the enemy

0 0 Forces executing the quired to turning movement may be re- sustain themselves for considerable periods of time Because of the vulnerability of their own lines of communi- cation they may be required to transport with them supplies in amounts considerably greater than they ordinarily carry Special provision for supply by air transport may be advisable or necessary
02 Whether or not the turning movement can be ini tiated prior to the contact of other friendly forces with the main enemy forces will depend on many factors Whenever possible the forces engaged in the turning movement should be from those not in contact with hostile forces when the maneuver is begun It is preferable to begin the turning movement from an area well to the flank and strike the hostile rear vital areas with surprise disrupt the hostile high command and assist in completing the total defeat of the enemy There can be no formulas as to the area from which the turning movement is begun nor the area to which it Is directed In one situation the friendly forces may be within mutually supporting distance (modern means of trans- portation have greatly Increased this distance) ; In another the turning movement may consist of operations both by land air and water to gain the hostile rear areas or areas otherwise vital to the prosecution of war by the enemy m 03 The successful turning movement presages great stra- tegic and tactical victory However the commander must give consideration to certain dangers inherent In this ma- neuver The commander of the turning forces will ordinarily be given a general directive for operation's ; Therefore the possibility always exists that the turning forces will turn too soon or too close to the main hostile forces find themselves confronted by a defended enemy front and be forced into a frontal attack or a change in direction of movement with the probable resulting delay As a consequence of the great distance separating the friendly forces there may be the risk of defeat in detail

maneuver and the possible hostile reactions The separate
forces must be strong enough to execute their missions without
assistance from the other Each must be capable of fully
exploiting a success gained by the other The elements allotted
the commander of the turning movement should be
strong in highly mobile hard-striking forces These must
be reinforced with powerful combat aviation means and
plentifully provided with suitable reconnaissance agencies
both ground and air The commander to whom is entrusted
the execution of the turning movement must be bold and
aggressive He must be one who having weighed carefully
the factors of the situation daringly puts his decision into
execution He must give full play to his initiative and be able
quickly to exploit successes or turn seeming disadvantages
into situations favorable to himself
STRATEGIC WITHDRAWAL AND COUNTEROFFENSIVE
i 05 It cannot be expected that advances along the entire
front of the armies on the offensive will be uniform Successes
will be notable on some parts of the front ; inability to advance
will be common on others ; reverses also must be expected
These varying degrees of success stalemate and reverse provide
the energetic bold commander opportunities to exploit
situations which seem unfavorable to him and favorable to
the enemy and thus achieve results of decisive importance
Under such conditions the higher commander may direct a
withdrawal where a stalemate has resulted or where he is
experiencing reverses and follow this withdrawal with a
counteroffensive to envelop and encircle the pursuing hostile
forces Boldly conceived carefully planned and energetically
executed this maneuver may bring decisive results
3 06 In the execution of the counteroffensive from a withdrawal
for the purpose of enveloping and encircling the hostile
forces certain fundamental doctrines are applicable :
a The withdrawing forces preferably should withdraw from
an area whose recapture is important to the enemy
b Terrain preferably en both flanks of the withdrawing
force should permit the flanks of the withdrawing elements
to be held and protecte u Behind these protected flanks

C Adequate mobile reserves are required for the rapid con- centration of forces necessary to accomplish the enclrclement Armored and motorized divisions are particularly Suited for this component of the counteroffensive These reserves should be moved secretly ordinarily at night Secret move- ment by day requires absolute air superiority in the area of movement The requirements of deception may not make this air superiority desirable In the area of withdrawal d The conduct of such an operation requires the most care- ful planning a highly trained and disciplined command and great initiative in all ranks e During the withdrawal and particularly just prior to the launching of the counteroffensive the withdrawing forces must be aggressive They must force the opposing com- mander to focus all 'or certainly most of his attention on the situation in front Local counterattacks and strong covering force action characterize this maneuver I When the counteroffensive is launched a strong frontal attack is combined with the attack of the encircling forces so directed as to "wrap up" the opposing forces and destroy or capture them
SECTION II
DEFENSIVE MANEUVER
GENERAL
0 07 Various factors may dictate the adoption of the strate- gic defensive in one or all areas at the opening of hostilities Included among these factors are the superior readiness of the enemy; inferior strategic position such as frontiers ex- posed on the flank ; inferior combat strength in one or more theaters ; or the advisability of deliberately adopting a de- fensive attitude initially to let the enemy expose his plans and commit himself
∎ 08 The strategic defensive confers some advantages in- itially on the nation or force which must gain time in order fully to mobilize its effort for offensive action The defender
4 2
LARGER UNITS 08- 0
will not have long lines of communication in hostile territory
to protect nor large hostile populations to control Where
time and space permit the defender may trade terrain for
the time necessary for the full mobilization of his offensive
power However for psychological reasons not only the
troops but the civilian population must be informed of and
impressed with the conception that such losses are temporary
only The commander has a responsibility to the nation as
a whole A nation correctly oriented as to the aims and requirements
of the military forces can be expected to and
will give its utmost to support the action of its armed forces
The strategic defensive ably conducted and appropriately
employing the tactical offensive will permit the field commander
to assemble his forces as they become ready By assembling
in such areas and at such times as to permit him to
take full advantage of enemy mistakes and move decisively
to the offensive he will be able to defeat the enemy's armed
forces and break the will of the hostile state to continue operations
The execution of such maneuvers requires that the
higher commander possess the highest qualities of leadership
that he be decisive and of adamant will power with the
ability to select the correct time for offensive operations and
that all forces be thoroughly indoctrinated with the fundamental
consideration that only by the offensive can decisive
results be achieved
0 08 Although conditions may require the adoption of the
strategic defensive initially the fundamental consideration
remains that no decisive results can be achieved by the deferl-
The power of initiative over-all threat and the ability
to strike at the tactical or strategic area of his choosing remains
with the higher commander who is on the offensive
It is he who forces his opponent to conform to and seek to
parry his movements

A Whether the defensive will be conducted initially with the intention of holding a general area and offering decisive battle In this area or of executing delaying or retiring ma- neuvers will depend on many factors Among these are the time during which it is estimated the defensive attitude must be maintained ; the space in which the defender can ma- neuver without engaging in decisive battle ; the necessity of protecting vital strategic areas such as essential Industries mines or other sources of raw material ; and the terrain on or near the boundary between the two States as well as that farther within the boundary Whatever the character of the defensive maneuver decided upon it must be predicated upon

N 2 It must be expected that an opponent strong in ar- mored means will seek to use this means to strike deep into the defender's rear (See pars 83 to 92 incl ) It is on roads that armored units can achieve greatest speed In many situations terrain and weather conditions may limit rapid movement of armored and motorized formations to roads It is therefore imperative that the commander give careful
44
consideration to and make adequate provision for suitable
antitank defense measures along all roads in rear of his
forward elements and in great depth on those roads Not
only can highly mobile enemy elements
iwhich
succeed t n
breaking through or enveloping a Position
and frequently make his position untenable but
unless they are blocked or delayed these elements may be
able to disrupt the orderly withdrawal or retirement of the
friendly forces Where time and facilities permit the antitank
defenses along roads in rear areas can be provided by
prepared installations This permits the commander to retain
his mobile elements for active offensive employment as
the situation dictates Tank-destroyer units provide the
commander hard-striking highly mobile means which should
be employed aggressively to seek out and destroy enemy
armored formations
DEFENSIVE IN ONE POSITION
i 3 When strategic considerations cause the high commander
to decide to execute his defensive mission in one
position the selection of the area for this position is his
next major strategic decision This decision will be influenced
by the factors which have been considered In F"v
00-5 under tactical operations of the defense and by the
necessity of protecting vital installations or areas Whether
the force engaged be an army corps or the entire field forces
of the nation the position must be such that the enemy
cannot risk passing the defender without offering battle
On the other hand the defender must not take a p
sit of
which will permit his forces to be contained by a p
the enemy forces while the remainder advance with slight
opposition to decisive objectives The flanks of the position
must be protected Where other conditions permit they are

must be organized to or it may be the culmination of maneuver block hostlle moves Under either condition it is of the utmost importagce that the mobility of the defending forces be such that hostile Successes in one area can be effectively met by elements from other areas It is the essence o/ the defense that the enemy be prevented from exploiting his initial success; and of the strategic de/ease that it can at the proper time and place launch a decisive counteroffensive 5 Factors indicative of or favoring the defensive in one position include the following : a Early arrival of reinforcements b Terrain the defensive power of which greatly augments the combat strength of the defender c Short distance Of the enemy from decisive strategic objectives
d Location of a position on the flank of the enemy advance which will force him to change direction and commit his forces in a maneuver less favorable to him e Strong natural or prepared flanks which cannot be turned or which will require long tedious operations to turn 6 Although the commander may plan to hold on one position until he can launch the offensive he must be pre- pared to meet enemy successes Rear positions must be reconnoitered and prepared Under suitable conditions on a part of the front he may execute a strategic withdrawal to these positions and follow by a decisive counteroffensive (See pars 05 and 06 )
i 7 Not only must the commander assure himself that suitable defensive measures are taken aga(nst hostile ground forces but also must be especially vigilant to defeat attacks against his rear by parachute troops and other troops traps ported by air or water (See FM 00-5 )
RETROGRADE DEFENSIVE
8 The retrograde defensive avoids decisive battle until adequate measures can be effected for the successful assump- tion of the offensive It delays the enemy draws'him farther from his major supply bases and elongates his lines of corn-
46
LARGER UNITS 8- 2
munication ; it inflicts losses by offensive tactical operations
and disrupts his plans by the operations of detachments in
his rear The retrograde defensive in one area may be
combined with the offensive in another area This combination
of maneuver finds special application when it will operate
to draw component elements of the hostile force away from
each other The retrograde defensive is suitable when time
and space factors are favorable and the initial loss of terrain
will be more than compensated by the reasonable expectation
of subsequent decisive results Tactical considerations affecting
the conduct of retrograde actions are discussed in
FM 00-5
® 9 Inherent in the retrograde defensive are the dangers
that the defending forces will become involved in a decisive
engagement at an unfavorable time For instance the enemy
may strike while a withdrawal or retirement is in progress
or the actions of subordinate commanders may precipitate
a major engagement urematurely The essence of this
maneuver is to cause the opponent to prepare for a series
of battles not one of which the defender permits to reach
culmination until the decsisive moment arrives
V 20 Whether the retrograde defensive is initiated prior to
or following close contact the general situation the lines
of communication net the operations planned for the future
and the location of strategically important areas will largely
influence the commander's decision as to the direction of
movement to be taken by his subordinate elements They
may be directed to move straight to the rear or they may be
directed to converge on a given area ; or the convergence may
follow after a series of moves straight to the rear Under
any condition control of the entire force must be such that
at the proper time a concentration of forces may be effected
and launched in a decisive counterblow Throughout the
defensive action suitable reserves must be available to prevent
an enemy break-through or exploitation of local enemy
successes
M 2 The retirement straight to the rear simplifies execution
of the maneuver; it permits the maximum use of road
and rail nets ; it confronts the enemy on a broad front whose

e The GHQ reserve battalions are self-contained units of
either light or medium tanks organized tactically and administratively
for employment by battalion or by group to furnish
additional striking power to other ground forces including
r mored divisions and corps Trained as units they are immediately
adaptable to inclusion in larger groupings of other
ground troops
∎ 3 CHARACTERISTICS -The characteristics of Armored Force
units are :
a Mobility -All combat units are mounted in armored
motor vehicles
b Fire power -Through a multiplicity of weapons mounted
on the vehicles
c Armor protection -All combat vehicles are protected by
armor of varying thickness capable of withstanding at least
rifle fire
d Shock action -Accomplished by the combination of the
other characteristics and by the weight and crushing power
of the major vehicles
0 4 METHODS OF EMPLOYING ELEMENTS OF ARMORED FORCEOperations
of components of the Armored Force may at
various times or simultaneously involvea
The attachment of GHQ tank battalions and groups to
infantry cavalry and armored divisions or corps
b The grouping of armored divisions corps or GHQ tank
groups with other corps or field armies for combined
operations
c The employment by the field or theater commander of
armored divisions and corps on independent or semiindependent
missions without reinforcing logistical means or
additional supporting troops other than combat and reconnaissance
'aviation
d Operation as task forces wherein armored divisions or
corps or at times GHQ reserve tank units are teamed with
motorized divisions antitank battalions antiaircraft 'automatic
weapons battalions and GHQ engineer maintenance
and supply units closely supported by combat aviation parachute
and other troops transported by air

with other means can achieve rapid decisive results in the
area of employment They are to be employed on decisive
missions They must not be frittered away on unimportant
objectives A mission far in advance of other main forces is
justified when the operation will obtain decisive results but
must be closely supported by other equally mobile troops
Their proper utilization necessitates a definite appreciation
and a careful consideration of the several characteristics of
the Armored Force units
a The conditions which should exist or be created for their
successful action are air superiority in the decisive area of
employment surprise favorable terrain and absence of or
neutralization of massed defensive means
b The mobility of armored units permits great latitude in
the choice of direction and the method of attack The decision
as to whether the attack will be executed as a turning
movement envelopment or penetration will be determined
largely by the time factor involved by the terrain and by
the hostile dispositions including hostile rear installations
The most suitable areas for the employment of Armored Force
units are on the open flanks or through existing gaps created
by penetrations of the enemy's positions
c The assignment of missions or objectives to armored
units must be preceded by a careful consideration of the more
important factors which affect the operation of the armored
and other units associated in the operations These factors
are : weather terrain throughout the entire area of contemplated
operation nature of the enemy and his methods of
combat availability of other supporting troops and especially
adequate space and road net for the operation of the units
concerned The axis of advance of the major armored and
motorized units will be along roads
d The most decisive results will be gained from the grouping
of overpowering masses of armored units and launching
them against vital objectives deep in the hostile rear The
armored mass must be supported by sufficient means to maintain
its momentum until the objective has been attained
e The most effective and decisive application of the mobility
and power of large armored and motorized combinations
will often necessitate the decentralization of control to
the appropriate commanders who will be guided only by the
broad general plan of the higher headquarters After the

5-6
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
initiation of the operation however the superior commander
must keep the armored unit commanders constantly informed
of the situation
f The maximum development of the demoralizing power
of the larger armored formations will be dependent in a large
measure on the continuous support of adequate reconnaissance
and observation aviation and timely assistance of combat
aviation in overcoming critical ground resistance beyond the
ability of available artillery This should be assured by direct
arrangement between air and armored unit commanders and
by adequate air-ground signal communication nets Higher
commanders can enhance the effectiveness of supporting
aviation by habitually assigning the same air and ground units
to work together as a task force or team
g The sustained mobility of armored and motorized units
is dependent upon adequate timely replenishment of required
supplies especially fuel and to a lesser degree oil and lubricants
Regular vehicle maintenance must be continued
When operations are to be prolonged for several days it must
be appreciated that armored and motorized units must have
opportunity for daily maintenance
h Because of their mass employment armored and motorized
units are difficult to conceal during approach and development
Elaborate measures for deception and surprise will be
required often and may involve variously : advance stockage
and concealment of essential supplies ; improvising and concentrating
dummy armored vehicles or marked activity of
actual units in localities distant from that of contemplated
employment ; extensive camouflage work ; and rapid shifting
ci armored masses to the area of decisive attack
d 6 A TAsx FORCE -A task force is a temporary tactical
grouping composed of one or more arms or services formed
for a specific mission or operation The operation of large
armored formations will frequently dictate the organization
of task forces The composition of such forces will be decided
only after a careful estimate of the associated means which
will be required to accomplish the projected mission or operation
This estimate must consider the nature of the expected
resistance the distance to which operations are projected the
terrain to be traversed and the troops available for the
operation The additional means to be associated with

armored elements will vary with each situation but may
comprise appropriately : infantry divisions foot or motorized
or components thereof ; cavalry units ; engineers ; combat aviation
; parachute troops ; other troops transported by air ; antitank
battalions ; antiaircraft units ; and additional maintenance
and supply facilities especially for GHQ groups
∎ 7 METHODS OF OPERATION -a Offensive operations of
armored units acting either alone or as part of a combined
force are characterized by rapid thrusts into vital parts
of the hostile rear followed by immediate exploitation to
complete enemy demoralization Armored division commanders
coordinate and control the movement of subordinate
units by appropriate assignment of routes zones objectives
or phase lines Phase lines are prescribed only
when required to insure coordinated action or movement of
two or more units and must not involve prolonged halts
thereon The attack is massed initially but is extended
promptly in frontage and depth by the armored reconnaissance
and combat elements after the hostile position is penetrated
As the operation gains momentum reconnaissance
agencies will precede combat elements at the earliest opportunity
to seek out and develop soft spots through which combat
elements may pass rapidly The more time allowed
for this reconnaissance the more effective it will be Contact
once gained must be maintained
b Maximum advantage is taken of speed and terrain
barriers to prevent or neutralize enemy countermeasures
Reconnaissance agencies provide information on which to
base security measures Other combat detachments provide
immediate advance flank and rear security Closely supporting
motorized units protect the immediate rear and lines
of communication of the armored elements Other motorized
units should relieve the armored unit commanders of
concern for extended lines of communication and assure continuous
logistical support When armored units are operating
as task forces the security of the immediate supporting
motorized elements will be enhanced by their following the
armored combat elements as closely as possible
c Following the advance of armored units other elements
of task forces operate to overcome remaining hostile resistance
occupy ground gained keep gaps open extend and
5
7-8
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
protect the flanks and relieve armored units temporarily
checked in order to permit their employment in a more
remunerative direction Whenever practicable other less
mobile troops will follow motorized task units as closely' as
possible to wipe out the last vestige of resistance meet
counterattacks and relieve the more mobile elements for
close support of the armored units
d In addition to establishing and maintaining local control
of the air supporting combat aviation is directed against
hostile antitank dispositions artillery and reserves especially
armored in the immediate zone of advance Concurrently
if available aviation suffices it may be directed
against hostile command and supply installations targets
of opportunity such as more distant reserves and other
formed bodies of troops especially armored units
e In an envelopment the support units of armored divisions
and task forces may when the situation demands
attack or contain enemy elements on the flank while tank
units make the main attack
f Troops transported by air may be suitably employed in
advance of armored units to seize critical points or to create
opportunity for immediate exploitation by armored forces
operating alone or as task forces
g Highly organized areas should be avoided Where their
attack is necessary it will usually be advisable for other
specially equipped infantry and engineer troops to breach
the enemy defenses in advance or concurrently with the
advance of the armored units unless heavy tanks are available
to lead the attack
h Against equal or superior hostile armored forces friendly
armored units will avoid frontal assault and maneuver to cut
off or destroy armored units supply facilities followed by
blows against the rear of enemy detachments
r 8 EXPLOITATION AND PURSUIT -a Large armored formations
operating separately or as part of task forces are especially
suited for exploitation and pursuit They should be launched
boldly against vital areas deep in the hostile rear The
exploitation and pursuit phase must be anticipated to insure
that appropriate plans are made and timely orders issued in
all echelons There must be no relaxing of pressure on the
shaken or beaten enemy Objectives for armored units should
6
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
8- 0
be those which will halt hostile rearward movement until less
mobile friendly troops can close with the enemy Concurrently
some armored elements operate to destroy disrupt
and paralyze enemy communication and supply
b Pursuit by large armored units operating alone or as
major elements of task forces is rapid and continuous even
during hours of darkness
c When the operations of armored units are likely to carry
them beyond practicable operating radius of organic supply
means special provision must be made by the higher commanders
to place necessary supplies within operating radius
of the units Likewise special arrangements must be made
by higher headquarters for rapid communication with the
widely dispersed elements of armored formations
• 9 DEFENSIVE SITUATIONS Large armored units as part of
other major forces on the defensive are held in readiness for
the counteroffensive or major counterattack The employment
of the armored units must be carefully timed and coordinated
with the attack objectives of the other forces
Local air superiority during the period of the counteroffensive
or major counterattack is a prerequisite to success of the
operations Usually the armored attack should be delivered
to disrupt the continuity of the hostile offensive and not
mefely to restore the defensive position
• 0 LOGISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS -a Where prolonged operations
of armored divisions and corps or GHQ tank units are
contemplated adequate arrangements must be made by the
higher headquarters to insure timely replenishments of supplies
required by the armored units Where the armored units
are required to operate at great distances from their base of
supply when continuity of supply is interrupted by enemy
action and in other emergency situations delivery of urgent
supplies may be made by air
b Where several armored divisions or GHQ tank units are
under control of one headquarters consideration should be
given to retaining one or more division or GHQ tank units in
reserve either for the purpose of extending combat operations
or of relieving similar units to permit necessary maintenance
and replacement operations In this manner continuity
of the operation and necessary maintenance rest and
replacement will be assured

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
0 ORDERS -a Orders follow the general form prescribed
in FM 0 -5 Mission type orders will be frequent Warning
and fragmentary orders in the form of messages overlays
and oral instructions are freely used to give early instructions
to subordinates so they will have adequate time to make their
reconnaissance and prepare their plans Orders of this
type together with operation maps aerial photographs and
standing operating procedure will reduce the scope of orders
of execution to a minimum
b Save in the beginning of an operation the use of formal
written orders will be exceptional Orders will normally be
dictated or oral and often fragmentary in units smaller than
the corps All commanders must be trained not only to be
able to give brief clear oral orders but also to be able to act
intelligently on receipt of any such orders
c Orders for combat must be thoroughly understood by all
subordinate commanders and their units They must be
timely to permit necessary dissemination and reconnaissance
by various affected echelons
2 COMMUNICATIOxs --a The usual methods of communication
used within armored units are visual signals motorcycle
messengers liaison officers radio and command airplanes
b Visual signals are used within the battalion and lower
units and between air and ground troops
c Motorcycle messengers are most efficient over short
distances and are used to a maximum to reduce the amount
of radio traffic
d Liaison officers are the most satisfactory means for
transmitting instructions where time is vital or the situation
is hazy For qualifications and duties of liaison officers and
their methods see FM 0 -5
e Radio communication is available down to include
vehicle commander in platoons of armored units In order
to derive the maximum use of this agency strict radio
discipline is essential Only essential sets are operated and
the maximum use is made of a simple system of prearranged
code messages
f Command and liaison airplanes are utilized to transmit
orders overlays and staff officers when the situation
warrants

INDIVIDUAL AND UNIT TRAINING
3 THE SOLDIER -a Man is the final and decisive element
in war Victory is gained through the application of technique
and employment of materiel by troops with high
morale discipline and the will to overcome all obstacles to
attain their objectives (See FM 2 -50 and 2 - 00 ) The
following requirements are essential in developing armored
units whose individuals are capable of superior performances
and confident of their ability to accomplish any mission
assigned
b A high standard of individual training attained by
painstaking and meticulous attention to the smallest details
is necessary to make the soldier mechanically perfect in
handling his weapon vehicle and equipment under all circumstances
Proficiency in these details may mean the
difference between success and failure of an operation and
life and death of the individual
c Emphasis on calisthenics and other forms of physical
exercises is essential to develop the high degree of physical
fitness and stamina necessary for withstanding the prolonged
strain of active campaign
d Each individual must be kept constantly informed of
the purpose of training and of the tactical situation in which
he is engaged Simulation of battle casualties among subordinate
leaders in combat training to allow the soldier to carry
out the mission of the combat team teaches him to accept
similar responsibility in actual warfare Realism in training
including all field exercises must be constantly stressed
by visualization of battle conditions and impressing upon
all the significance of such conditions
e Every opportunity during training will be utilized to
create enthusiasm and interest to stimulate alertness pride
in personal appearance sense of responsibility and to develop
initiative and esprit de corps
• 4 THE LEADER-a The qualities of command leadership
must be developed to a high degree in all grades The ability
to analyze situations basically and quickly to reach sound
decisions and to give expression thereto in concise and
clear orders will be developed in all leaders through frequent
tactical exercises
9
4- 5
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
b Initiative must be demanded in all grades Mental
alertness and aggressiveness and ability to think act and
quickly take advantage of tactical opportunities must be
developed to the highest degree In the absence of orders
each individual must use his judgment and act in accordance
with the tactical situation in furtherance of the general
mission
c A sense of duty which subordinates personal consideration
to the welfare of the unit or group and a will to accept
personal hazards and prolonged intensive effort in the execution
of orders must be demanded
d Leaders must always be well forward to receive early
information of the situation make their estimate announce
their decision and issue orders personally to the subordinate
commanders
e Leaders must understand and appreciate the thoughts
and problems of their troops They must make every effort
to provide timely necessities insure rest and protect their
troops from unnecessary hazards
f Leaders must require strict and complete obedience and
demand the maximum measure of sacrifice from their units
when necessary to insure victory
0 5 THE UNIT -a The primary training objective of each
unit will be the early development of an efficient hardstriking
unit which is prepared to take the field at short
notice at existing strength and capable of conducting combined
operations against an enemy equipped with modern
means of warfare
b Success in battle depends upon the coordinated employment
of all available arms and technique applicable to the
situation This coordination is only obtained through painstaking
combined training of highly trained individuals and
units Tactical flexibility is based on the ability to exact
definite and rigid standards of performance from individuals
and units committed to action
c Men are grouped into units with a view to their training
for and use in combat Individuals constantly trained
quartered and fed together develop a feeling of solidarity
which must be furthered by the greatest degree of-permanence
being given to squad and platoon assignments (See

GENERAL
∎ 25 GENERAL DOCTRINE -a The tactical employment of armored
force units is based upon the doctrine set forth in
FM 00-5 and chapter of this manual Their characteristics
favor the striking of quick hard blows
b Armored units should be assigned missions which their
characteristics are designed to accomplish and except in
emergencies should not be assigned missions that other
available troops can perform satisfactorily
c Since tanks furnish the striking power of armored units
it is necessary to understand and keep constantly in mind
their capabilities and limitations in the assignment of missions
(See ch 5 )
d The capabilities are-
( ) High road speed : 35 to 40 mph
(2) Ability to move cross country at speeds up to 25 mph
in especially favorable terrain
(3) Ability to cross small obstacles ditches and shallow
streams
(4) Ability to pass through thin woods and brush
(5) Great fire power
(6) Crushing ability to overrun personnel materiel and
equipment
(7) Armor protection for crew

26 TERRAIN AND WEATHER -a The terrain exercises an
important and often decisive influence in tactical situations
It may be the determining factor in the decision to employ
armored units on a specified mission or not Generally the
terrain will determine the tactical form of an attack and the
ground over which the main attack will be launched
b A thorough appreciation of terrain and Its effect on
operations is essential to the proper command and employment
of all armored units Areas most favorable for their
employment are determined from : the study of maps reconnaissance
agencies higher and adjacent units troops already
in contact with the enemy and personal reconnaissance by
the leader or his staff
c Gently rolling open terrain with occasional lightly
wooded areas affording some cover and facilities for observation
is the most favorable for operations of armored units
Desirable terrain is that which provides covered routes of
approach positions for supporting units and permits the
maximum use of the speed and maneuverability of armored
vehicles
d Terrain broken by natural obstacles such as unfordable
streams ravines or streams with steep banks marshes cliffs
dense woods closely spaced boulders or stumps forces armored
units either to make long detours or follow canalized
routes limiting their maneuverability choice of direction
and method of attack
e Rough hilly or mountainous terrain reduces the speed

of armored troops to almost that of dismounted troops or
else restricts their movements to roads Armored troops
when restricted to roads and defiles unless frequent "turnarounds"
are available are particularly vulnerable to attack
by hostile aircraft and to antitank weapons
f Armored units avoid defended towns or cities when possible
except when they can be surprised Such localities
are attacked by motorized infantry or other closely following
troops
g Unfavorable weather may materially affect operations
of armored force units Rain mud ice and snow may impede
limit or prevent the employment of armored units
Extremes of temperature adversely affect both materiel and
personnel However inclement weather may prove advantageous
to the troops inured to hardships
∎ 27 COVER AND CONCEALMENT --a The discovery of unusual
numbers of tank units in a given area is an indication of
a probable major operation in that vicinity The concealment
of vehicles therefore is important at all times particularly
from aerial observation and photography Partial
concealment is of little or no value Every practicable effort
must be made to provide complete concealment
b Camouflage is work done to provide concealment of
materiel troops or military works from enemy air or ground
observers To be effective camouflage must be supervised by
personnel thoroughly familiar with its principles and methods
The means employed are nets paulins paint earth branches
and grass The fundamental rules of camouflage are covered
in detail in FM 5-20 and 2 -45
c Personnel of armored units must be thoroughly instructed
in the use of natural means of camouflage available
and be required to apply habitually these means to conceal
themselves and vehicles
d The following rules governing concealment should b ;
known and understood by all :
( ) Natural concealment should be sought before resorting
to camouflage ; it is simpler requires less time skill and
material and is more effective Concealment of bivouacs
is much simpler in woods and villages than in the open
Vehicles are best concealed by placing them under heavy
natural cover as in dense woods In partly open country
7
2 7
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
they should be driven into thin woods or clumps of trees or
brush
(2) Camouflage should not be overdone A small amount
of material judiciously employed is frequently more effective
than a mass of material Branches of trees brush weeds
leaves grass or dirt are usually available to cover tents and
vehicles that are partially or wholly exposed Irregular
patches of different material are better than solid blankets
of any one kind
(3) The worst enemies of concealment are straight lines
regularity of pattern angles and shadows * Therefore ingenuity
must be exercised to change or break the outline or
regularity of the pattern of the object being camouflaged
Shelter tents in bivouacs and vehicles in parks or assembly
areas should always be placed in scattered irregular formations
(4) An aerial observer cannot see an object within a
shadow ; neither will an aerial photograph of the locality
reveal it Even a partial shadow crossing the object makes
recognition difficult from the air Therefore natural concealment
can be obtained by halting vehicles within shadows
(5) Care should be taken that track imprints do not
disclose the location of vehicles Tracks may be obliterated
by covering them with brush leaves or dirt or by dragging
over them with branches or some other means The enemy
may be further deceived by running one or more vehicles
beyond the true entrance to the area and obliterating the
actual entrance In entering woods fewer tracks will have
to be obliterated if vehicles enter in column and scatter after
getting under cover Also in dense woods care should be
taken not to knock down any more trees than absolutely
necessary and then straighten up those that have been
knocked down
(6) Making paths within bivouac to concealed vehicles
should be avoided unless such paths are concealed from air
observation
(7) When foliage is used to cover vehicles and other equipment
it should be renewed daily Wilted leaves and
branches will appear different in color from natural surroundings
when observed or photographed from the air
Care should also be taken in gathering natural camouflage
to avoid denuding the ground in the immediate vicinity of
8

the object being camouflaged Fresh dirt should be covered
with brush leaves or grass
(8) No rubbish of any kind should be allowed to accumulate
about a bivouac
(9) Fire or smoke should not be permitted near vehicles
( 0) Ruins provide one of the best means of concealment
( ) At night necessary lights are concealed
( 2) If natural concealment is not available vehicles
halted in the open should seek very broken ground folds in
the ground etc Natural or artificial means available should
be used to disguise their characteristic profile
( 3) Bright or shining parts of material should be covered
with mud or grease
e Concealment in snow is much more difficult than at
other times The following points should be kept in mind :
Trails get tracked with mud and melt out early leaving a
black line ; snow falls through camouflage material and the
holes show dark; the heat of engines and of kitchen ranges
cause early melting of snow This can be remedied by keeping
activity at a minimum when snow first falls ; and by
covering trails vehicles etc„ with fresh snow replacing it
as often as needed
f The noise of running engines particularly those of
tanks can be heard at a considerable distance and will disclose
the presence of concealed tanks to ground observers
Engines therefore should always be stopped as soon as vehicles
have been placed under cover or concealed This
should likewise be done whenever practicable as a means
of conserving fuel
g The following precautions should be observed while
moving to attack or in close proximity to the enemy :
( ) Use all available natural cover whether stationary or
moving
(2) Halt preferably under trees in thickets or in the
shadow of buildings or trees
(3) Choose routes of approach which provide the most
cover and concealment such as ravines draws gulleys or
folds in the ground; avoid skylines
(4) Avoid bottoms where vehicles may be bogged down
and clumps of bushes where sink holes stumps etc may be
encountered
(5) Avoid dense woods ; travel along the edges
9
passing over soft ground stream crossings ditches or similar
obstacles
( 2) If time permits and if considered essential obliterate
tank tracks by dragging suitable objects over them
( 3) When approaching the enemy if the presence of tank
units has been disclosed deception as to direction of attack
and numbers of vehicles may be obtained by running several
tanks back and forth off to a flank
SECTION II
RECONNAISSANCE
∎ 28 GENERAL -a The purpose of reconnaissance is to gain
information upon which to base strategical maneuvers or
tactical operations
b Information desired may be of the enemy or of the terrain
Information concerning the enemy may include his
location disposition strength organization capabilities
movements attitude equipment and morale Information
concerning the terrain may include character of roads
streams cover and concealment positions bivouac areas and
suitable areas for employment of obstacles
c Responsibility -The commander of each unit is responsible
for maintaining reconnaissance for information that influences
his own operations or which is required of him by the
higher commander The detailed preparation of plans and
orders for reconnaissance is the function of the staff Plans
for the employment of armored force units should be based
on the most careful and detailed reconnaissance practicable
in the time available Every effort must be made to obtain
the information of greatest importance e the essential
elements of information
20
should be expressed in specific questions stating the information
desired such as :
(a) Enemy
Does the enemy occupy position? If so in what
strength? What are his approximate dispositions?
Where is the enemy's reserve?
What is the strength and location of the enemy's advanced
columns?
What supporting weapons does the enemy have?
(b) Terrain
Are certain roads passable for all armored vehicles?
Are certain bridges intact? What is their capacity?
Are-certain terrain features capable of defense by hostile
or friendly troops?
Are obstacles present which affect the plan of attack or
defense?
e Routine information -In addition to the essential elements
of information prescribed by the commander ground
reconnaissance units obtain and report at specified times or
at most practicable time as a matter of routine without additional
orders and in conjunction with the execution of specific
missions information covering the following items :
( ) Route and bridges -Type condition load and traffic
capabilities
(2) Landing ffelds -Location and suitability
(3) Utilities (water sewage electric power communication
railroads docks) -Condition and repair necessary
(4) Supplies -Amounts location type and condition particularly
fuel lubricants and food
(5) Prepared obstacles demolitions mines and contaminated
areas -Location extent means of avoiding
(6) A continuing brief estimate of terrain -Fordability of

direction of flight
(8) Hostile ground forces -Location and time of all hostile
contacts giving strength composition and movements with
particular attention to location and movements of hostile
mechanized forces
(9) Friendly troops and miscellaneous Includes friendly
troops within the sphere of action of the reconnaissance unit
and other intelligence data not included in other items pertinent
to the operation such as weather visibility etc
f Sources of information -The sources of information are
varied and include reports from reconnaissance agencies
actual observation of terrain or physical objects information
or intelligence reports procured from other units examination
of inhabitants prisoners documents aerial photographs
maps spies or identifications and summaries from
higher and lower echelons
g Reconnaissance agencies -( ) The execution of the
commander's plan for reconnaissance is the task of the reconnaissance
agencies The reconnaissance agencies and
personnel available to the armored division and its elements
are :
(a) The attached observation squadron
(b) The division reconnaissance battalion which includes
three armored reconnaissance companies and a light armored
(tank) company
(c) An armored reconnaissance company in each armored
(tank) regiment
(d) The reconnaissance platoon in the headquarters company
engineer battalion and reconnaissance and liaison
section in each engineer company
(e) The personal reconnaissance by the commander staff
officers and subordinate commanders
(f) Artillery reconnaissance elements
(g) Scouts and patrols
(2) The reconnaissance agencies and personnel available
to the GHQ reserve tank groups and battalions are :
(a) Reconnaissance platoon in the group and battalion
headquarters companies
22
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
2 8
(b) Personal reconnaissance by the commander staff
officers and subordinate commanders
(c) Scouts and patrols
h Classification -Reconnaissance is usually classified in
accordance with the location of the objective and the phase of
operations as distant close or battle reconnaissance
( ) Distant reconnaissance is the function of the aviation
and the division reconnaissance battalion It seeks to locate
the advanced elements of the enemy forces and maintain contact
with them It procures the information upon which the
strategical and operative decisions and the plans of the high
command are based Distant reconnaissance is dealt with
in FM 00-5
(2) Close reconnaissance is the function of the regimental
reconnaissance companies It seeks to gain more detailed
information for tactical operation such as the location
strength composition and movements of the enemy and a
reconnaissance of the terrain
(3) Battle reconnaissance is a function of all echelons of
the command and must be continuous It includes observation
of all enemy forces engaged in the action and those whose
contact with our principal forces is imminent Both air and
ground troops should seek the location of hostile flanks
changes in hostile dispositions location of hostile artillery
movement of hostile reserves preparation for counterattacks
and indications of a withdrawal
i Plans for the employment of tank units require in addition
to the usual classes of reconnaissance a special type
of battle or tank reconnaissance to determine when where
and how tanks can best be employed Tank reconnaissance
is of particular importance to all commanders of tank units
It is always made prior to an operation and when possible
before orders are issued Information may be obtained by the
regular reconnaissance agencies but will normally be obtained
by personal reconnaissance or by scouts or patrols dispatched
from the tank units in the area over which tanks are to
operate Information of this type must be obtained by GHQ
reserve tank battalions when attached to cavalry or infantry
divisions
j Reconnaissance in force -When hostile resistance is encountered
which cannot be brushed aside flanked or outflanked
by the reconnaissance agencies a reconnaissance in
23
28
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
force may constitute the best method of clearing up an uncertain
situation Troops assigned to this mission may vary
in strength from an armored (tank) company to a reinforced
armored regiment but must be sufficiently strong to accomplish
the mission Their action will usually consist of a local
attack on a limited objective The commander who orders a
reconnaissance in force must consider the possibility that his
intentions or those of the higher commander may thereby
be disclosed He must also be prepared for the eventuality of
the reconnaissance in force bringing on a general engagement
k Zones routes and localities -( ) To avoid duplication
cf effort reconnaissance agencies must be assigned a zone an
axis or route or a locality or area for reconnaissance The
boundaries thereof are not to be construed as limiting the
movements of the units but rather as definite guides as to
areas of responsibility for reconnaissance The maximum
liberty of movement that the situation warrants should be
allowed
(2) When the enemy is disposed on a broad front or
when his location is in doubt a zone of reconnaissance may
be assigned Factors to be considered in determining the
width of the zone of action are the terrain ; the road net;
strength of forces to be employed ; strength disposition and
activity of the enemy ; facilities for communication ; and the
time available
(3) When information indicates the enemy's advance is
by a definite route (or routes) a route (or routes) for reconnaissance
is generally designated
(4) When accurate information has disclosed the presence
of the enemy in a definite area then that locality or area
is assigned for reconnaissance
(5) In large forces such as a division or larger a reconnaissance
line is designated marking the limit of reconnaissance
between the higher and lower unit The subordinate
unit reconnoiters outward to this line the superior unit beyond
it Either may cross the line if necessary During
an advance the reconnaissance line is advanced from day
to day so that prior to the commencement of each march
stage reconnaissance by the division has explored in advance
to a distance equal to at least a day's march
(6) Advance of reconnaissance elements will be regulated
by designation of successive phase lines or objectives which
24
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
23
may be crossed or passed only on orders or in accordance with
a time schedule Lateral communications between reconnaissance
elements is maintained by contact normally on phase
lines or at designated objectives
(7) Reconnaissance phase lines should include easily identified
terrain features such as roads streams railroads or
towns
(8) Observation aviation should know in advance the limits
of reconnaissance for the reconnaissance battalion and the
route of the battalion command post
Coordination -The commander coordinates the employment
of reconnaissance agencies at his disposal He regulates
their employment in such manner that they will
supplement and assist one another Duplication of effort
is avoided by the assignment of reconnaissance missions and
objectives and by informing subordinates concerning reconnaissance
to be executed by agencies of other commanders
m Aggressiveness -Reconnaissance agencies must be active
and aggressive Such missions generally require secrecy of
movement As a rule combat is avoided which is not necessary
for gaining essential information Essential information
'can frequently be obtained only through attack Reconnaissance
units do not hesitate to attack when their
mission requires it
n Reserves -Commanders initiating reconnaissance should
arrange for reserve reconnaissance elements which can be
employed to reinforce or extend reconnaissance to the front
or flanks
o Communications -( ) To insure the prompt and reliable
transmission of the results of reconnaissance the commander
must regulate the establishment and maintenance of
signal communication including the coordination of communication
to be used between air and ground reconnaissance
agencies When there is danger of hostile interception he
may sharply restrict or prohibit the use of radio in the interest
of secrecy
(2) In the employment of ground reconnaissance agencies
the distance they are sent out and the front to be covered
consideration must be given to the sending range of radios
Frequently reconnaissance units particularly divisional reconnaissance
will be out beyond direct radio communication
with their commanders Under such circumstances informa-
2 5
28
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
tion will have to be transmitted by airplane through pick-up
messages or relayed by radio through air-ground nets or
reconnaissance nets of lower units
(a) A liaison type airplane working with the division reconnaissance
if practicable will speed up transmission without
interfering with missions of other agencies or utilizing their
radio sets which are needed for transmitting information
that they have obtained
(b) Shuttling of command cars until they are within radio
range or even dispatching motorcycle messengers may be
used as expedients but have obvious disadvantages Motorcycle
messengers may however be utilized expeditiously for
short distances between elements of the divisional or regimental
reconnaissance units
(c) Provision should be made in the regimental reconnaissance
unit for listening in on the divisional reconnaissance
net
p Instructions -( ) Instructions for the execution of reconnaissance
in large units may be issued in the form of an
intelligence annex (see FM 30-5 and 0 -5) In small units
they may be included in the field order or be issued separately
in complete or fragmentary form as instructions for reconnaissance
(2) Instructions to reconnaissance agencies should include
in addition to the mission and essential elements of information
the following :
(a) Time of departure
(b) Zone areas or route
(c) Objectives and time to be reached
(d) Duration
(e) Reconnaissance phase lines and time to be crossed
(I) Instructions concerning adjacent reconnaissance units
(g) Instruction for the transmission of reports or time
reports are desired
(h) Instructions about communication with observation
aviation
(i) Time of departure route and objectives of main force
(3) In the absence of instructions each unit executes the
reconnaissance necessary to its own operations within its own
zone of action and toward any exposed flanks

0 29 EXECUTION OF RECONNAISSANCE -a Distant reconnaissance
-The speed and mobility of armored troops and of a
mobile enemy requires air and ground reconnaissance forces
to operate at great distances from the main body (See fig )
( ) Air -(a) Distant reconnaissance by air will be wide
and deep and is usually conducted beyond the sphere of action
of friendly ground forces It will never be less than the operating
range of hostile armored forces or the equivalent of
a day's march for the division that is from 00 to 50 miles
It will normally be initiated prior to the establishment of
contact between ground forces and is under control of the
commander of the armored force unit
(b) Time the ever increasing depth of zone to be observed
and the fact that available aircraft are seldom adequate to
perform all the missions desired precludes detailed reconnaissance
of areas off the main roads Initially "search"
missions to locate the enemy concentrations and to provide
early information of the enemy's dispositions and movements
are the most important Primarily they should be confined
to the main routes or probable localities The commanders
of armored units also need information as to the condition
of roads bridges defiles and general terrain features many
miles ahead in order to guide their fast moving columns and
to direct their reconnaissance elements in the right direction
avoiding unnecessary detailed reconnaissance This is known
as route reconnaissance Other missions i e surveillance
tracking or photographic may be assigned It is important
however that the priority of missions be specified in the orders
or instructions
(c) The tactics and technique of air reconnaissance and
observation are contained in FM -20
(2) Ground -(a) Since effective reconnaissance cannot be
made at the rate of march of the division reconnaissance
elements should be pushed out sufficiently far in advance of
the division to insure the timely receipt of information by the
division commander In an initial advance prior to contact
with the enemy the divisional reconnaissance may precede
the division by as much as 00 miles and usually is sent out
to 2 days in advance of the main body
(b) When the division is moving under cover of darkness
reconnaissance should be pushed out during daylight hours
to a line beyond the expected bivouac location of the division

A line of observation is established during the hours of darkness
to warn of the movement of hostile troops that might
interfere with the march or bivouac of the division
(c) In other situations reconnaissance should be sent out
sufficiently early to gain their distance in front of the main
body and have at their disposal the time necessary for
reconnaissance
(d) The divisional reconnaissance battalion may be required
to cover a perimeter of as much as 50 miles Detailed
reconnaissance of such a large area is usually impracticable
The usual objectives are principal terrain features critical
points or areas and hostile main forces previously indicated
by observation aviation The assignment of broad frontages
for reconnaissance necessarily will restrict in detail the information
that can be expected and may result in gaps between
adjacent elements
(e) In general the breadth of zone for the battalion should
not exceed from 30 to 50 miles It is determined by the situation
location strength and composition of the enemy the
road net and terrain and the mission of the main body
(f) Each reconnaissance platoon can reconnoiter in average
terrain a front of about 5 to 7'/2 miles in width while advancing
a t the rate of approximately 2 to 5 miles per hour
Assigning two platoons to reconnaissance and one to reserve
in each reconnaissance company will enable the battalion to
reconnoiter on a 30-mile front while the division is moving
Initially one reconnaissance company may be held in reserve
If the rate of advance is decreased the width of reconnaissance
can be correspondingly increased
(g) When contact is gained the divisional reconnaissance
battalion seeks to locate enemy dispositions including his
flanks and favorable ground for an assembly position for the
attack The methods used by the reconnaissance platoon and
company are discussed in chapter 4
(h) The ground reconnaissance agencies work in close cooperation
with the aviation which will furnish some positive
information and a very large amount of negative information
Ground agencies will develop the information that requires
verification and verify and amplify the positive information
When the aviation is prevented from getting information
because of weather conditions or hostile air superiority
the ground reconnaissance must be prepared to extend its
29
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
reconnaissance Each arm supplements and assists the other
Team play is essential
(i) The successful operation of an armored unit will be
materially impeded if not stopped unless there is a constant
flow of information from the reconnaissance agencies to the
commander ' Communication from air to ground is usually
accomplished by radio or dropped messages ; from ground to
air by radio pick-up messages or by a prearranged system
of panel signals Information by radio from the aviation is
received by the ground reconnaissance agencies at the same
time it is received by the armored unit commander In this
way advantage is taken of important and vital information
and reconnaissance directed accordingly Ground elements
use motorcycles to augment or replace radio communication
(j) In order to give power and drive to the reconnaissance
battalion and sufficient combat power to overcome minor
opposition an armored (tank) company is provided This
company will normally remain with the battalion headquarters
in a central location if the road net permits It may
be dispatched in detachments or as a unit to furnish support
for reconnaissance companies when required Where
the front to be covered is so broad that prompt assistance
cannot be rendered ; or where critical points must be reached
and held temporarily ; or where hostile resistance is expected
to be encountered detachments of the armored (tank) company
may be attached initially to the reconnaissance company
elements When the necessity for the attachment no
longer exists the tank elements revert to battalion control
(k) Platoons and sections of the armored (tank) company
execute reconnaissance over terrain that is unsuitable for
wheeled vehicles They may also be used to reduce resistance
that is delaying the advance of the more lightly armored
units of the battalion
( ) Normally it will be desirable and necessary to attach
engineers to the battalion Elements from this detachment
accompany the reconnaissance units and furnish detailed
road information with particular reference to condition of
bridges and fords The engineer detachment locates and
makes initial preparations for stream crossings
(vi) The principal function of the battalion is reconnaissance
It should not be assigned security or combat missions
that will interfere with the performance of reconnaissance
30
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
29
(n) Provisions must be made for replenishment of rations
fuel and ammunition and for maintenance of vehicles
b Close reconnaissance -When contact with the enemy is
imminent reconnaissance is intensified More detailed information
will be required on points of decisive importance
near the probable or actual zone of contact of the ground
forces Air and ground reconnaissance agencies by continuous
reconnaissance endeavor to determine the contour and
identification of the enemy's leading elements the frontage
and depth of the enemy's movement his assembly position
his measures for antiaircraft defense the location of his
airdromes detraining stations principal supply establishments
and any changes when they occur
( ) Air -The primary mission of the air reconnaissance
is to extend In depth the zone under observation by ground
reconnaissance and to secure information which will enable
ground units to give effective direction to their reconnaissance
activities The principal objectives are roads communication
centers and exits of woods and villages These
objectives are closely observed both day and night with a
view to discovering the location of the enemy's main forces
and their direction of movement Flights made shortly after
dawn and before dark offer a favorable opportunity for discovery
of night movements The missions for the observation
aviation include: route reconnaissance march liaison
surveillance search tracking and photographic missions
(2) Ground -(a) Regimental reconnaissance is conducted
under the direction of the regimental commander by the
methods set forth in chapter 4 The reconnaissance elements
precedes the main body of the regiment by 3 to 4
hours and covers the entire width of the regimental zone
The regiment follows on one or more axial roads The extent
of the front or area covered by this reconnaissance
depends upon the mission amount and kind of resistance
expected the available road net and front covered by the
regiment A reconnaissance company under normal conditions
can reconnoiter a zone about 5 miles in width con
taming three or four axial roads and frequent lateral roads
at the rate of from 9 to 2 miles per hour
(b) Reconnaissance operations at night are generally restricted
to movements of elements to initial positions from
which they may continue or commence operations at dawn
3
29
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
Night reconnaissance limits observations and requires slower
speeds and more extensive dismounted observation Movement
by armored reconnaissance vehicles at night is limited
to roads except for short periods over favorable terrain or
during bright moonlight
(c) Detailed reconnaissance of important areas not covered
by elements from reconnaissance units may be executed
by patrols from the main body or at times by motorcycle
scouts The details of employment of scouts and patrols are
set forth in chapter 3
(d) Frequently reconnaissance elements will be required
to attack to obtain exact information of hostile dispositions
or they may encounter hostile mechanized counterreconnaissance
units When this is anticipated tank elements may
be attached to reinforce the reconnaissance platoons Normally
tank elements are not used for other than battle
reconnaissance
(e) Engineer and artillery reconnaissance personnel accompany
the regimental reconnaissance company
( ) The length of missions is dependent upon the ability
to supply gasoline and oil endurance of personnel and reservicing
and maintenance of vehicles
c Battle reconnaissance -Battle reconnaissance begins
when units initiate development for combat
( ) Air -(a) In the assignment of missions during battle
consideration must be given to the number of missions that
can be effectively executed with the aviation available Of
especial importance are the reconnaissance of movements
of hostile troops in rear areas and on the flanks of the battle
position and the surveillance of hostile detrucking and detraining
points Air reconnaissance and surveillance of areas
beyond the zone of reconnaissance of front line troops and
divisional ground reconnaissance will be continuous before
during and after battle
(b) Battle reconnaissance missions report all dispositions
and activities in the immediate battle area with particular
emphasis on the following :
Gaps in enemy positions enemy reserves command
posts railhead supply and distributing points and
tank and troop concentrations
2 Mechanized forces artillery and antitank guns
mines and demolitions road and area blocks
3 2
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
29
3 Conditions of routes bridges and terrain on the
projected route of the armored units and between
them and hostile armored forces
4 Artillery missions which include the location of
artillery targets adjustment of artillery fire report
of effect of fire and general surveillance of
scheduled artillery fires and enemy activity Airplanes
assigned to artillery missions operate under
direction of the artillery commander
(c) priority is given to radio in communicating information
to command posts ground reconnaissance elements
and to the artillery This method as compared to using
dropped messages expedites the action and quickens the battle
reconnaissance by obviating the necessity for the airplane
returning many miles with each important item of information
Moreover it permits the command post and interested
subordinate elements in the divisions to keep abreast
of the situation In case of radio failure or silence drop
messages may be resorted to This method may cause delay
in locating the various command posts
(d) A certain amount of battle liaison can be performed
simultaneously by airplanes on battle reconnaissance missions
However when enemy aerial and antiaircraft activity permits
battle liaison may be performed satisfactorily by the
slower liaison type of airplane Battle liaison is concerned
with:
Visual location of front lines and tactical disposition
of advanced elements
2 General locations and unusual conditions affecting
adjacent units
3 Command and liaison missions including the transmission
of information and instructions between
the superior commander and his artillery infantry
and other subordinate commanders ; also all observation
missions executed for special information
for the superior commander These missions
may be ordered for the purpose of obtaining or
verifying information as to the tactical situation
of the units engaged or to obtain other urgent
information
(e) Radio provides the quickest means of communication
both from air to ground and ground to air Where other
33
2 9
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
means are available they should be utilized keeping the
net free and available for emergency messages Such additional
means are ; from air to ground: dropped messages
rocket signals and simple airplane maneuvers ; from ground
to air : pick-up messages or by prearranged system of panel
or other signals
(2) Ground -(a) Immediately preceding combat as the
enemy main force is approached detailed reconnaissance of
hostile dispositions and of terrain is intensified by all reconnaissance
agencies
As the regimental reconnaissance companies and security
detachments of the various columns make
contact with the enemy the reconnaissance battalion
may be relieved by them and move to the
flanks and continue reconnaissance against the
hostile flanks and rear
2 Elements of the reconnaissance battalion in contact
with the enemy maintain contact during combat
In this case regimental reconnaissance companies
may be attached to the reconnaissance battalion
to continue reconnaissance to the flanks and rear
(b) During combat the division reconnaissance elements
gain contact with the enemy by working through gaps
and around the flanks and rear and ascertain the strength
composition and dispositions of the enemy main force and
the approach of enemy reinforcements When ordered the
reconnaissance elements avail themselves of every opportunity
to harass enemy command and supply installations reserves
or reinforcements without becoming engaged in combat at
the expense of adequate reconnaissance
Where the terrain or the situation prohibits further
reconnaissance to the front during battle the
divisional reconnaissance battalion may be ordered
to protect an exposed flank or the rear of the
division and give timely warning of approaching
air and tank attacks It may be withdrawn into
division reserve to reservice and recuperate pending
further missions
2 Regimental reconnaissance units when no longer
able to perform reconnaissance to the front proceed
to the flanks of their unit to secure them

during combat and give warning of air and tank
attacks
(c) After combat the reconnaissance battalion moves either
around the flanks or through a gap in the hostile front to
determine the routes of withdrawal of the hostile main
column ; whether his withdrawal is well organized or in disorder
; the covering positions with reference to his columns ;
and whether or not critical points on his routes are held in
strength Contact must be maintained
(d) When the battle results in the withdrawal of our own
forces contact with the enemy must be maintained The
delaying force must be constantly informed of the progress
of the hostile troops
Divisional reconnaissance towards the enemy will be
extended to the flanks to obtain information of
the direction of the main threat of the enemy's
pursuit or exploitation
2 The reconnaissance battalion may be ordered to delay
and harass the enemy by action against his
head and flanks while continuing reconnaissance
3 Reconnaissance In the direction of withdrawal must
be instituted to insure that the routes of withdrawal
are free of enemy and clear of obstacles
(e) After combat the regimental reconnaissance companies
prepare to assist in the exploitation pursuit or withdrawal
of their regiment in the same manner as the divisional
reconnaissance units function with the division A portion of
the regimental reconnaissance may be attached to rear or
flank guards when necessary to further the mission of these
security detachments (See sec III )
d Tank reconnaissance -This type of reconnaissance is
conducted prior to an operation when the use of tanks is
contemplated It is made to determine : the location capacity
concealment and suitability of positions ; the routes
to selected positions ; the terrain over which tanks may operate
; and the allotment of tanks
( ) The Items to be considered regarding positions include
in general :
(a) Routes Into and within the assembly or intermediate
position
'
(b) Available routes to point of probable subsequent
activities

(c) Available routes to alternate positions
(d) Water (quantity quality and reliability)
(e) Cover and concealment

(i) Suitability for local defense
(g) Shelter for maintenance activities
(k) Assignment of areas to subordinate units
( ) Tactical soundness of location
(2) Prior to any movement of tank units principle routes
and alternate routes should be thoroughly reconnoitered and
a suitable system established for marking the routes and furnishing
guides In reconnoitering routes consideration must
be given to the following :
(a) Means of identification day or night ; i e„ by landmarks
sketches description map reference or aerial photographs
(b) Critical points and areas for location of guides and route
markers
(c) Distance over entire route and important parts thereof
and time required to traverse them
(d) Detailed data on routes such as kind (road trail or
cross country) ; width (one-way or two-way) ; grades ; surface
(firmness smoothness) ; defiles ; availability ; probable
effect of changes in the weather; and practical speeds day or
night wet or dry
(e) Cover and concealment including defilade
( ) Fords ; whether depth and conditions of bottom and
approaches permit crossing and whether water level is rising
or falling
(g) Bridges including location size kind capacity condition
and material required for reinforcement Also possibility
of detouring around them
(h) Tank obstacles including mines and contaminated
areas ; their location nature and possibility of removing
neutralizing or avoiding them
(i) Friendly installations including steps necessary to prevent
destruction of telephone wire point of crossing field

e Personal reconnaissance In preparing for combat personal
reconnaissance of the terrain by the commander staff
officers and subordinate commanders under protection of
leading elements is conducted whenever possible to supplement
and verify reports of reconnaissance agencies
q 30 TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION-a All commanders are
responsible that their immediate and lower unit commanders
are promptly and fully informed of the situation
b Neighboring units and reconnaissance agencies when
meeting habitually exchange pertinent information Reconnaissance
elements in contact with the enemy cooperate with
reconnaissance elements and security detachments that may
be employed in the interval between the main force and the
reconnaissance elements in contact Information of vital interest
to these reconnaissance elements and security detachments
is transmitted through "listening in" radio sets dropped
messages from airplanes or by messengers
c First contact with the enemy and new identifications are
always reported by the most rapid means available Negative
reports must be submitted with the same promptness as positive
information
d Prisoners inhabitants messages from patrols and documents
are examined by the reconnaissance unit or detachment
commander and forwarded to the main body by the quickest
and most reliable means available Radio airplanes scout
cars motorcycles or impressed motor transportation may be
used In friendly or occupied territory commercial wires
should be used whenever practicable
e Captured prisoners are evacuated by any available means
together with a digest of their individual statements
/ Units in contact although closely engaged in combat are
not relieved of the responsibility of making reports as often
as desired by the higher commander In order to offset the
failure to receive a report commanders must make provision
for obtaining prompt information by special reconnaissance
and by sending liaison agents to higher subordinate or
adjacent units

g Artillery observers and liaison officers transmit to the
higher commander over their own communication systems
important information which might otherwise be delayed
in transmission
∎ 3 SUMMARY -a The prompt employment of armored
force units necessitates early information of the enemy and
of the terrain in order for the commander to formulate sound
plans and make prompt decisions
b All available reconnaissance agencies must be used boldly
to gain and maintain contact and obtain information
c Reconnaissance agencies must be dispatched in advance
of the main force in time to allow for proper reconnaissance
of the designated zones routes or localities and to get information
back to the commander in time to be of value
d Information must be transmitted by the quickest and
most reliable means available
e Prior to combat personal reconnaissance by the commander
staff officers and subordinate commanders must
supplement and verify reports of reconnaissance agencies
f All reconnaissance personnel must be trained to note
and report on suitable terrain for the employment of tanks ;
possible emergency landing fields ; water and gasoline supply
sources ; and similar Items of vital importance to armored
force units
g The successful operation of an armored force is dependent
upon a constant flow of information to the commander
SECTION III
SECURITY
∎ 32 GENERAL -a Security -Security embraces all measures
taken by a command to protect itself against annoyance
surprise attack observation and interference by the enemy
It includes the special measures taken for protection against
hostile aviation and ground forces including mechanized and
chemical attacks Security is always necessary whether in
movement at the halt or in combat In bivouac and in
movement security is provided in all directions Adequate
and timely information is the basis of all security measures
Continuous reconnaissance is therefore an essential part of
security Security retains freedom of maneuver for the
commander
38
TcTfos AND TECnNIQI g
32-35
b Responsibility -The commander of each unit is responsible
for the security of his command This includes the protection
of his lines of communication unless such protection
is furnished by the higher commander The superior commander
prescribes security measures for the protection of the
command as a whole or coordinates those adopted by subordinate
commanders He insures that measures adopted are
appropriate to the hostile threat Subordinate commanders
provide additional security required for their own local protection
When contact is imminent security measures are
increased
c Warning -All security measures include an adequate
warning service consisting of observers and the means of
signal communication In this manner changes in hostile
dispositions and other operations on the ground and in the
air are known early Special measures are taken to warn
of the approach of hostile mechanized or air forces
∎ 33 SECURITY AGAINST GROUND FORCES -The principal security
measures against ground forces include reconnaissance
the employment of security detachments the distribution
formation and mobility of units and utilization of terrain
a Reconnaissance -While reconnaissance is closely allied
with security reconnaissance and security forces operate in
accordance with different considerations Reconnaissance
influences security by indicating to the commander the measures
to be taken to protect his forces Under certain conditions
It may be the only measure employed for security
Information furnished through reconnaissance is a guide to
the commander for determining the strength composition
and disposition of his security detachments
b Security detachments -( ) General--Security detachments
are elements of a command assigned to protect the
main body Such detachments are always necessary whether
in movement at the halt or in combat On the march security
detachments are called advance guards rear guards flank
guards and march outposts ; in camp in bivouac or in a
defensive position they are called outposts ; during development
for combat covering detachments ; and in combat
combat patrols (See FM 00-5 )
(2) Missions -In general the mission of a security detachment
is to furnish the command with information rela
39
3 3
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
tive to the enemy to protect the command against surprise
observation and interference by hostile ground forces and
to maintain the freedom of maneuver for the command by
gaining the time and space it requires to make the necessary
dispositions The priority given to these missions embodying
reconnaissance counterreconnaissance and resistance varies
with the situation and the expressed intentions of the
commander
(a) Information of the enemy in proximity is obtained
by the reconnaissance elements or combat patrols from the
security detachment
(b) Protection of the main body from surprise observation
and interference is accomplished by preventing the
enemy firing into the main body and from observing the
size dispositions and composition of the main body ; and by
holding the enemy and gaining time for the main body to
deploy before coming under effective fire
(c) Freedom of maneuver of the main body is insured by
the security detachment which according to circumstances
attacks resists or delays the hostile forces
(3) Strength -The strength of a security detachment depends
upon the mission assigned it the terrain proximity
of the enemy and the size composition and physical condition
of the command In certain situations security detachments
constitute a partial commitment of the strength of a
command to action They are given sufficient strength to
preserve freedom of action for the main body and no more
As far as practicable tactical unity is preserved in the detail
of security detachments
(4) Formations of security detachments -There is a similarity
in the formation of advance flank and rear guards
and outposts Each comprise groups which send out patrols
or post sentinels for observation These reconnaissance
groups are reinforced by a support the principal element of
resistance In large security detachments a reserve is provided
The reserve constitutes the principal maneuvering
and reinforcing element for offensive or defensive action as
determined by the mission of the security detachment
These missions in turn depend upon the plan for the subsequent
employment of the command as a whole
(5) Distances or time interval -(a) The distances or
time interval between the main body and the security de-
40
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE 33
tachments and between subdivisions of the security detachments
will vary with the size and mission of the security
detachment visibility and terrain and strength composition
and proximity of the enemy It should be sufficient to allow
the security detachments time to cope with small hostile
forces to allow successive elements of the detachment space
to maneuver and to secure the uninterrupted movement of
the main body
(b) The normal distances between vehicles and units comprising
elements of security detachments on the march will
be those prescribed for tactical marches (See sec VII )
Fixed or routine distances cannot be prescribed for all movements
of detachments as terrain composition mission hostile
air activity and many other factors will influence the
conduct of the movement
(c) When operating in darkness fog or in close country
distances maintained will be less than when operating in
daylight clear weather or in open country Distances between
the main body and security detachments and between
subdivisions of the security detachments should be reduced
to that consistent with control ; between vehicles it should
be reduced to that consistent with visual communication with
the vehicle immediately preceding and following
(6) Rate of march -The march order prescribes the rate
of march for the command and the distance between the
security detachments and the main body The main body
regulates the rate of march whenever the command must
maintain a certain rate of march to reach a designated place
at a prescribed time When contact is imminent the advance
guard regulates the march
(7) Communication -( a) Communication between the
elements of the security detachment and between the security
detachments and the main body is maintained by the
quickest means available Radio except when radio silence
is necessary or motorcycle messengers are the principal
means employed The commander and leader of each element
of the security detachment have radio equipped vehicles
In addition one or more motorcyclist should accompany
the security detachment commander for messenger
service
(b) Leaders of security detachments send information
4
3 3 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
promptly Promptness is vital because of the mobility of
all units
(8) Control -(a) Control is obtained by means of radio
visual signals connecting files or the main body commander
may designate phase lines control points assembly positions
or message relay points when such are necessary to insure
control and facilitate communications
(b) The normal drill signals for "halt " "forward " and
"assembly " and simple improvised signals to indicate "enemy
in sight" or "all clear" are used
(e) Contact between elements of security detachments and
between the main body and security detachments is maintained
by connecting groups or files (See par 34 )
(9) Movement -Security detachments on the march regulate
their movements so as to give the main body the protection
required by the tactical situation and offered by the
terrain When contact is imminent they move by bounds as
outlined in the following subparagraphs When darkness
fog or rapid rate of march of the main body makes the
movement by bounds Impracticable or inadvisable movement
is continuous and at a prescribed rate
(a) An advance by bounds is accomplished by a forward
element gaining distance over the one in rear to reach some
important point which possesses tactical advantage either
for observation or combat The smaller the element the
more easily its speed can be changed and the shorter and
more frequent are its bounds
(b) A bound of a forward element should not be so great
as to place' it beyond supporting distance of the next succeeding
element
(c) A bound of a rear element should be under the protection
of the element next in front
(d) An advance by bounds has several important advantages
It-
Enables an element to reconnoiter the terrain before the
following element has closed up
Permits the crossing of terrain that may be under hostile
observation or fire in the shortest time
Offers opportunities for the interrogation of Inhabitants
and for servicing of vehicles
Offers opportunities to coordinate the advance
c Distribution of units The distribution of units In the

main body is made in accordance with their probable tactical
employment Each unit makes provision for prompt
formation and movement to facilitate the command's readiness
for action
d Utilization of terrain Terrain and the road net influence
the commander in his selection of positions or routes
for the main body and for the security detachments A map
study supplemented by air and ground reconnaissance will
disclose terrain which may afford protection to the command
while in movement or at the halt A consideration of the
road net and terrain will also be a determining factor in the
location of the security detachments with respect to the
main body
U 34 CONNECTING GROUPS (FILES) --a A connecting group
is a detachment detailed by a force to maintain contact
(liaison) with a neighboring force or between units (elements)
of a force on the march Elements of a connecting
group used within a march column are called connecting
files
( ) Connecting groups are used to maintain contact with
adjacent forces prior to and during combat
(2) They are used between units within march columns
where distance limits visual communication
(3) They are always used during night marches within a
march column
(4) Within the main body connecting groups are furnished
from the unit in rear to maintain contact with the preceding
unit
(5) Within a security detachment connecting groups are
furnished by the larger element to maintain contact with
the next smaller element For example from the main body
to the advance guard (flank or rear guard) within the
advance guard from the support to the advance party
(6) Connecting groups are especially useful when :
(a) Observation is limited because of- terrain features or
weather
(b) A march column passes through a city or large town
(c) The route of march has many changes of direction
(d) The route of the preceding element is difficult to follow
(7) Connecting groups are not to be confused with reconnaissance
or combat patrols although their missions in certain
situations are similar
43
34-35
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
b Mission -The primary mission of a connecting group is
liaison Specifically its duties are to-
( ) Keep the commander of the force from which detailed
informed of the location and progress of neighboring units
(2) Observe and report any penetrating hostile force and
oppose such force until arrival of reinforcements or until
the threat has ceased
(3) Maintain connections and liaison within a march
column
c Strength and composition -( ) The strength of a connecting
group depends upon its mission When its mission
is one of liaison it may be small ; when the distance between
adjacent forces is great and hostile threat exists it is larger
It varies from two motorcyclists to a platoon
(2) For liaison with adjacent units scout car half-track
/4 -ton truck or tank elements may be used
(3) For liaison on the march between armored units such
groups consist of two or more motorcyclists or /4-ton trucks
The number of motorcyclists detailed for this purpose will
depend upon the distance between units the terrain visibility
and the number of motorcyclists available
d Formations and methods of operation -( ) Formations
for connecting groups vary with their mission terrain and
hostile situation
(2) For contact and liaison with an adjacent force a patrol
formation is used
(3) For contact and liaison within a march column a
connecting group usually marches in the interval between
the units to which its mission applies
(a) Whenever visual contact is broken connecting files
preferably in pairs are detached from the group to maintain
visual contact When visual contact is regained they close
on the connecting group leader at increased speed if in rear
of the leader ; or halt and await his arrival if in front of the
leader
(b) When the number of connecting files is limited and
visual contact cannot be maintained because of distance or
terrain connecting files move by bounds
0 35 COMBAT PATROLS -a Purpose -( ) Combat patrols are
security detachments sent out to the front flanks and rear
to protect the main body or the detachment from which sent
out

(2) Units engaged in combat employ combat patrols for
their protection
b Mission -The primary mission of combat patrols is
security Specifically their duties are to-
( ) Observe the terrain for hostile dispositions and movement
(2) Gain contact with the enemy in a close situation and
furnish timely information of enemy movements towards or
around the flanks
(3) Drive off small enemy forces which threaten the front
flanks and rear and contain larger forces until suitable
preparations can be made to oppose them
c Strength and composition -The strength of a combat
patrol depends upon the force from which detailed the enemy
and the terrain It may consist of a pair of motorcyclists
one or more I/4-ton trucks a section of half-tracks or a section
or platoon of tanks
d Formation and methods of operation -Combat patrols
operate under orders from the commander of the force from
which they are detailed The formation in which they move is
similar to that prescribed for reconnaissance patrols Their
conduct is different in that combat is usually required for the
accomplishment of their missions They regulate their movements
upon the body from which detached
∎ 36 ADVANCE GUARDS -a General -An advance guard is a
security detachment which precedes the main body on the
march
b Mission and duties -The mission of an advance guard
is to insure the uninterrupted advance of the main body and
to protect it against surprise and observation by hostile ground
forces Specifically its duties are to-
( ) Guard against surprise and to obtain information by
reconnoitering to the front and flanks
(2) Push back small parties of the enemy and to prevent
their observing firing upon or delaying the main body
(3) Check the enemy's advance in force long enough to
permit the main body to prepare for action
(4) Determine the strength and location of the hostile lines
and flanks when the enemy is encountered on the defensive
but to avoid bringing on a general engagement unless empowered
to do so

c Strength and composition -( ) The strength of an advance
guard for armored force units varies from a small
fraction to about one-fourth of the command From front to
rear it consists of a point advance party support and reserve
In an advance guard consisting of less than a battalion the
reserve is generally omitted Figure 2 may be used as a guide

(3) If any portions of the advance guard are unnecessary
the rear elements are the first omitted The point is always
present
d Distances -Within the advance guard the following
are considered satisfactory limits during daylight : (See fig
2 )
Main body to reserve-5 to 0 minutes
Reserve to support-3 to 5 minutes
Support to advance party- to 2 minutes
Advance party to point- /2 to minute
e Rate of march -When the movement of the main body
is dependent upon information which the advance guard
obtains or upon the actions of the latter the advance guard
regulates the rate of march At night it is usual for the
advance guard to regulate the rate of march
f Main body commander ( ) The main body commander
issues the order for the movement of his troops and
prescribes the size and composition of the advance guard
or guards to be employed
(2) He issues the necessary instructions to insure the
operation of the advance guard in furtherance of his general
plans and to control its progress and movement
(3) If the command is marching in two or more columns
orders to the advance guards may prescribe phase lines selected
with regard to the road net and terrain on which
periodic control is established and necessary instructions
for the coordination of the advance guards
(4) During the march he may join the advance guard
commander thus keeping himself informed of the situation

in his front and keeping the latter advised of any changes
in his plans he may deem necessary to make
g Advance guard commander -( ) Upon receipt of a
march order the advance guard commander issues the necessary
orders for the disposition and movement of the advance
guard
(2) During the advance he may control the advance guard
from any position His usual position is in rear of the
advance party
(3) When the enemy is encountered he makes a rapid personal
reconnaissance and decision for the employment of
the advance guard as follows :
(a) To employ any part of the advance guard as necessary
to dislodge the enemy in time to prevent delay of the march
of the main body
(b) To establish a defensive position to cover the approach
march and offensive action of the main body
(c) To contain or delay a hostile force permitting the
main body to continue its advance
(4) When the leading elements of the advance guard engage
the enemy the advance guard commander moves forward
close to the axis of movement of the advance guard
to observe the action and to keep the commander of the main
body informed of the situation When the enemy has been
disposed of he reorganizes the advance guard elements rapidly
and continues the advance
h Point commander -( ) The point commander is responsible
for the conduct of the point In large advance
guards the point commander may be mounted on a /4-ton
truck and ride wherever he deems his presence necessary
His usual position is with the self-propelled mount
(2) He instructs the point en route and makes sure that
the designated route is followed
(3) In case the designated route becomes impracticable
or obstacles are encountered over which the main body
cannot readily move he notifies the next higher commander
and executes reconnaissance promptly to determine routes
around the obstacle
(4) In case the enemy is encountered he will :
(a) Report contact
(b) Employ the self-propelled mount to drive off hostile
resistance Send dismounted members of the point to re-
49
36
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
connoiter the enemy position fire on and mark the hostile
flanks with tracer ammunition and to signal If the enemy
withdraws
(c) Send prompt information to the next higher commander
of the hostile strength composition and disposition
(d) Reorganize the point following combat prepared to
continue the advance
(5) If the scouts sent out from the point remain out of
view for an unreasonable period the point commander will
assume that these scouts have been shot or captured and
will send dismounted scouts to reconnoiter the place where
they disappeared before permitting the point to proceed
i• Point -( ) The point is both a reconnaissance and security
element (See fig 2 ) Its observation is limited to
the line of march It pushes forward boldly by bounds employing
the self-propelled mount if attached closely supported
by the advance party On winding roads or where
terrain features between definite bounds prevent visual contact
elements within the point maintain visual contact until
the next bound is reached thus avoiding stopping at intermediate
points of no tactical value
(2) Its principal duties in the advance are to-
(a) Reconnoiter the road on which the column Is marching
and observe to the immediate flanks
(b) Gain rapidly elevations edges of woods and other
points of vantage from which a good view to the front can
be obtained or which the enemy might try to occupy
(c) Give timely warning to the element next in rear of
the enemy's presence or of road blocks mines traps or similar
methods for delaying a marching column
(d) Drive back or disperse promptly small hostile patrols
When the enemy encountered is too strong to be defeated by
the point the point protects the next element in rear
(e) Remove small obstacles blocking the route When
these obstacles require more manpower and technical equipment
than that contained in the point it proceeds beyond the
obstacle and protects the next element in rear while engaged
in removing the obstacle When the obstacle Is defended
the point first assists in driving off the enemy
(f) Push boldly into villages along the line of march and
determine promptly whether or not they are occupied by the
enemy
50
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
36
(g) Remain on or near the route of advance in order to
protect the head of the column from surprise
(3) In the execution of its duties the elements of the point
proceed as follows :
(a) Motorcycle scouts if available work as a pair preceding
the rear vehicle ( /4-ton truck self-propelled mount armored
car half-track or tank) keeping always a bound ahead They
move in single column staggered on either side of the road at
a distance of 35 to 50 yards between scouts Successive bounds
are made at the maximum speed road conditions permit
(b) At the end of each succeeding bound they slow down
halt short of the crest bend etc„ and the leading scout (:Ismounted
moves to reconnoiter the terrain to the front and
check the route The remaining scout observes to the flanks
He also is employed to reconnoiter lateral roads if necessary
riding out to a position where he can observe for at least 600
yards (effective rifle range) Motorcyclists maintain contact
within the point
(c) When an obstacle or enemy is discovered one scout
reports this information to the point commander the other
scout remaining in observation
(d) Scouts do not move forward to the next bound until
they have signalled "all clear" to the remainder of the point
Control is maintained by visual signals
(e) When fired upon scouts seek cover report contact and
then reconnoiter to determine the direction and nature of
the hostile action They fire their weapons in self-defense
and to warn elements in rear
(/) In case a hostile position has been passed without being
observed by the scouts they will return dismount and attack
the enemy They will especially seek and bring under fire
antitank guns or machine guns If the enemy withdraws
they endeavor to ambush him The scouts avoid getting in
the line of fire from other elements of the advance guard
(g) Upon reaching a terrain feature In rear of the motorcyclists
crew members from the rear vehicle of the point
observe to the immediate flanks When the terrain time element
and situation warrant a dismounted reconnaissance
will be made for a short distance to either side of the route
of march
(h) This vehicle closes on the motorcyclists on receipt of

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
signals from the motorcyclists It coordinates by bounds
its movement with that of the advance party
(i) If the enemy is encountered the rear vehicle and the
self-propelled mount if present will move forward depending
upon the location of the enemy and place fire on the enemy
The crew when necessary will continue its reconnaissance
dismounted
j Advance party -( ) The advance party is both a reconnaissance
(maneuvering) and holding (pivot) element (See
fig 2 ) Its principle duties are to-
(a) Maintain connection with the point and assist it in
overcoming resistance encountered on the line of march
(b) Extend flank reconnaissance to a distance of about
800 yards
(c) Check the enemy's advance until the element next in
rear has time to prepare for action In case the enemy encountered
is too strong for the advance party to defeat the
latter reports the fact to the next element in rear and reconnoiters
the enemy's strength and dispositions
(2) In the execution of its duties the elements of the advance
party proceed as follows :
(a) Each vehicle commander receives acknowledges and
passes signals both from the front and rear and moves by
bounds coordinating its advance with the rear vehicle of the
point
(b) When contact is gained the leading vehicle remains
on or near the axis of march and engages the enemy by fire
to support the action of the remainder of the advance party
(c) If subjected to surprise fire the leading vehicle will
seek a defiladed firing position if immediately available ; otherwise
unless a tank the vehicle will be abandoned for a
dismounted position
(d) Whenever fire is opened on the leading vehicle the
advance party commander in the next vehicle in column
makes a hasty reconnaissance mounted or dismounted depending
upon the available cover and disposes the advance
party initially to protect the next element in rear
(e) In larger advance guards a platoon of tanks an
engineer section and one or more mortar squads constitutes
the advance party They perform reconnaissance to the
flanks either by having a patrol march parallel to the axis
of movement where the terrain permits or by having the
5 2
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
36
patrol move direct to reconnoiter features of terrain and return
to the axis Only those terrain features that may afford
possible positions for the enemy should be reconnoitered
This reconnaissance is continuous when dictated by the
situation and terrain
(f) When enemy resistance stops the advance the tank
platoon extends reconnaissance to locate the flanks drive
out the enemy and develop the situation reporting results to
the advance party commander
(g) If the enemy resistance is too strong to be overcome
by the advance party each element will hold its most advanced
position and cover the approach of rear elements
of the advance guard or of the main body
(h) In advance guards where there is no support the
tank platoon may be left as a containing force while the
main body bypasses the enemy position
k Support -( ) The support bears the same relation to
the elements in its front and rear as the advance party does
to the point and support It extends the reconnaissance
(maneuvering) or acts as the holding (pivot) element (See
fig 2 ) In the absence of a reserve it is also the principal
striking element Its principal duties are to-
(a) Maintain connection with the advance party and assist
it in overcoming enemy resistance
(b) Extend the flank reconnaissance to a distance of about
mile
(c) Check the enemy's advance until the element next
in rear or the main body has time to prepare for action
In case the enemy encountered is too strong to be defeated
the support reports the fact to the next element in rear
protects it and extends reconnaissance
(2) In the execution of its duties the elements of the support
proceed as follows :
(a) March at the prescribed rate of march maintaining
the time distance in front of the reserve if present or the
main body It should not move on the next bound until the
preceding element has cleared
(b) Extends the reconnaissance to the flanks in a similar
manner to that of the tank platoon in the advance party
(c) When the enemy is encountered it reenforces the action
of the advance party whether it is combat reconnaissance
or both

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
The reserve -The reserve is the striking (main blow)
element of the advance guard Its employment is based on
the information obtained from the lesser forward elements
and other sources by the advance guard commander
m Artillery -In an advance guard for a regiment or larger
unit it will often be desirable to attach a battery of field
artillery When attached it will normally march as the
rear unit of the advance guard with a reconnaissance officer
well forward If no artillery is attached to the advance guard
the necessary artillery support for its action is furnished by
the artillery with the main body When the need for their
employment can be foreseen supporting antiaircraft artillery
may accompany the advance guard It occupies critical points
en route
n Aviation-While not normally attached to the advance
guard available airplanes should be directed to cooperate
They render valuable assistance by reporting direct to the
advance guard commander the approach of enemy forces the
location of hostile positions along the axis of advance pertinent
information of roads and bridges and other similar
information
o Engineers -Engineers march at the rear of the support
or near the head of the reserve Their principal functions
are to repair or strengthen bridges remove obstacles prepare
stream crossings and repair roads An engineer detachment
marches at the rear of the advance party ; its function is to
furnish early engineer information Where need for their use
can be foreseen engineers with bridge building equipment
may be attached to the rear element of an advance guard
p Medium tanks -In the absence of artillery with the
advance guard or where their use can be foreseen medium
tanks may be attached to the advance guard composed of
a light tank unit or a regiment or larger unit
q Mortars In an advance guard for a battalion or larger
unit the attachment of at least a squad of mortars is desirable
It is used to neutralize enemy observation posts and
screen the movement of advance guard units and later if
necessary the development of the main body
r Trains -The unit trains of an advance guard generally
remain with the trains of the main body A truck to transport
gasoline for refueling motorcycles should march at the
rear of the last element in the advance guard The light

TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
36-37
maintenance elements of units performing advance guard
duty march in rear of their units
s Advance guard in retrograde movement -In retrograde
movements an advance guard 'should be detailed It will
vary from a point to a larger element depending on whether
or not there is a possibility of an enemy attack against the
head of the column If there is no enemy threat the principal
missions of the advance guard will be to clear the route
of march insure the uninterrupted movement of the main
body and regulate civilian and refugee traffic For the latter
purpose military police may be attached
t March outposts -Advance guards are used in forming
march outposts for temporary or prolonged halts (See par
40 )
∎ 37 COVERING DETACHMENTS-a General -( ) A covering
detachment is a security detachment used to protect troops
moving in the presence of the enemy
(2) It is used when early contact with the enemy is expected
and when because of this expectation the main body
is deployed in an approach formation
(3) A covering detachment is always used in an approach
to a line of departure
b 'Missions -The missions assigned to covering detachments
are similar to those given an advance guard except in
situations requiring combat strength The primary mission
is that of security ; the secondary mission is reconnaissance
Specifically its duties are to-
( ) Guard against surprise and obtain information by observing
to the front and flanks
(2) Cover a larger force in the approach to a line of
departure
(3) Guide a larger force over the best terrain available
(4) Push aside small enemy patrols and offer resistance
to larger hostile forces until the main body attacks
(5) Support the main body in an attack
c Strength and composition -A covering detachment for
a tank company usually consists of a platoon ; for a battalion
* platoon reinforced by detachments of the battalion headquarters
company; for 'an armored regiment a light tank
company reinforced
d Formations -( ) Formations for covering detachments
55
37-38
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
vary depending upon the terrain They are generally deployed
over a broad front with very little depth
(2) The interval between vehicles (squads) varies between
50 to 300 yards depending on terrain and visibility
e Communication and control -(l) Communication and
control are maintained normally by radio or prearranged
visual signals Exceptionally motorcycle or other vehicle
messengers may be employed
(2) Movement of the covering detachment is controlled by
the main force commander from his position in the interval
between the covering detachment and the main force
Methods of operation -( ) The covering detachment
precedes the unit from which it is detailed
(2) It moves by successive bounds the limitations of each
bound being indicated by the force commander and not by
the covering detachment commander
(3) Upon arriving at each terrain objective the covering
detachment halts and observes to the front and flanks until
ordered to make another indicated bound Full advantage is
taken of available cover
(4) Covering detachments attack small patrols and offer
resistance to larger forces
(5) Upon reaching the line of departure the covering
detachment may constitute the leading assault wave ; may
halt and support the attack by fire ; may afford flank and
rear protection ; or follow in support or reserve
g Reconnaissance -Reconnaissance elements may be attached
to a covering detachment the size of a company or
ordered to cooperate with a smaller covering detachment
When the terrain and road net are favorable early information
of hostile dispositions can be obtained by the reconnaissance
elements which enables a covering detachment to
better carry out its mission
E 38 REAR GUARDS -a General-A rear guard is a security
detachment which follows and covers the main body on the
march The fundamentals covering rear guards and rear
guard action are contained in FM 00-5
b Who may perform -Armored units are suitable to perform
rear guard duty because of their mobility and fire power
which enable them to withdraw quickly after delaying the
pursuing enemy to the last possible moment However this
56
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
38
use is exceptional and sacrifices their offensive power This
mission should not be assigned armored units when other suitable
units are available However the rear guard covering
the retirement of a combined force often contains armored
units
c Mission and duties -The mission of a rear guard is to
assure an uninterrupted movement of the main body and to
protect it from attack observation or interference by hostile
ground forces Specifically its duties are to-
( ) Guard against surprise and furnish information by
observing to the rear
(2) Hold back small forces of the enemy and prevent their
observing firing upon or delaying the main body
(3) Check an enemy in force until the main body has time
tc prepare for action march beyond the range of hostile fire
or occupy a position
(4) Provide suitable passive measures of opposition such as
interposing obstacles and destroying or damaging bridges and
roads
(5) Collect stragglers and lost vehicles and destroy
abandoned property
d Strength and composition -The strength and composition
of a rear guard for armored units depends upon the
mission;' direction of a march nature of the terrain and
upon the mobility and strength of hostile forces likely to be
encountered Its strength and composition should be such
as to permit the execution of its mission without the intervention
of the main body
( ) Strength -Its strength varies from a small fraction to
about one fourth of the command
(2) Composition -It normally is composed of machine gun
and tank elements It may be augmented by artillery and
mortar elements to provide greater combat power for reconnaissance
units ; and by engineers chemical and medical
troops At night it may be composed of infantry and engineer
elements and when the situation is obscure it should consist
primarily of armored or motorized infantry
e Formation -The rear guard formation resembles that of
an advance guard reversed Next behind the main body
marches the reserve followed in turn by the support rear
party and rear point In general the size of the rear guard
is smaller than an advance guard except in retrograde move-
57
3 8
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
ments When the size makes it impracticable to have all
the elements they are omitted in order of size beginning with
the reserve A rear point is always present
f Distances or time interval -On the march distances or
time intervals between the rear guard and the main body and
between subdivisions of the rear guard vary In general they
are governed by the size and mission of the rear guard by
visibility and terrain ; and by the strength composition mobility
and proximity of the enemy The distances and time
intervals previously outlined for advance guards may be taken
as a guide subject to the following :
( ) Support to reserve -The minimum distance between
the support and reserve is determined by the consideration
that the support must delay the enemy until the reserve can
prepare for action The maximum distance is that which the
reserve can take without exposing the support to the liability
of being cut off These distances may be greater in
open country or during daylight than under the opposite
conditions
(2) Reserve to main body -The minimum distance between
the reserve and the main body is determined by the consideration
that the rear guard must protect and not be driven back
upon the main body The maximum distance is that which
can separate the reserve and the main body without subjecting
the rear guard to the danger of being cut off by the enemy
It must not be such as will permit intervention of hostile
forces in strength between the reserve and the main body
g Rate of march -( ) The march order prescribes the rate
of march for the command and the time or distance between
the rear guard and the main body
(2) The elements of the rear guard usually retire by bounds
based on the progress of the main body and the time limit
set by the main body commander for holding designated lines
They may follow the main body at a steady rate of march
when conditions render the movement by bounds impractical
or unnecessary
h Communication and control -Communication and control
are maintained between the rear guard and the main
body and between subdivisions of the rear guard in the same
general manner as has been previously outlined for advance
guards
58
n
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
38
i Conduct of rear guard -( ) When the distance from the
enemy permits the rear guard retires in march formation
(2) When in contact with the enemy the rear guard moves
on a broad front and opens fire at long range to force the
enemy to deploy and thus delay his advance Unless the
security of the main body requires a stubborn resistance the
rear guard as far as practicable avoids close range combat
and withdraws successively from position to position as the
enemy approaches
(3) The rear guard fights in successive positions
(4) The rear guard commander makes timely provision
for preliminary reconnaissance of new positions and routes
thereto
(5) The successive positions of the rear guard are chosen
at such distance from each other that the enemy is forced
to renew his preparations for attack including forward displacement
of his artillery in each instance
(6) A rear guard position should favor withdrawal by affording
covered routes of withdrawal
(7) When the enemy presses his pursuit closely greater
resistance is offered Full use is made of surprise attacks
and ambushes to slow down or halt the hostile advance
(8) In general the main efforts of the rear guard like those
of any delaying force must be constantly directed toward
barring roads or other avenues of approach and denying or
disputing to the limit of available means their use by the
enemy forces
(9) Hostile mechanized elements usually attempt to attack
from the flank Against such forces care must be taken to
prevent dispersion of the rear guard in order that it may be
able to repel flank attacks and avoid being cut off from the
main body
( 0) Advantage is taken of favorable opportunities to
punish over-hasty pursuit by counterattacks against the heads
of pursuing columns or against hostile forces attacking from
the flank Ambush of leading hostile elements will be effective
in slowing down and punishing a hasty enemy Such
tactics will cause the enemy to be more cautious and consequently
slower in action
( ) A rear guard resorts to such defensive measures for
halting or delaying the enemy as obstructing fords executing
59
38
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
demolitions within the capabilities of the rear guard felling
trees across the road burning stretches of grass or shrubs
or by the use of persistent chemicals
f Duties of rear guard elements -( ) (a) In general
each rear guard element maintains connection with the
next lower element and by fire action or otherwise assists
it in effecting withdrawal
(b) Each element observes or reconnoiters to its own rear
and flanks and furnishes timely information of the enemy
situation to the next higher commander
(c) Each element covers the retirement and cooperates in
the fulfillment of the mission of its next higher element
(d) Each element in falling back avoids masking the fire
or interfering with the action of the elements covering its
withdrawal
(e) Limited flank reconnaissance for their own protection
is performed by elements of the rear guard When special
flank reconnaissance is necessary it is performed by reconnaissance
units attached to the rear guard or by patrols detailed
for this purpose from the reserve or main body
(2) The principal duties of the rear guard elements are
as follows :
(a) Rear point -The rear point is a patrol from the rear
party and follows the rear party en route It adheres closely
to the route of retirement observing constantly to the flanks
and rear to detect hostile moves It discourages pursuit by
firing upon hostile elements
(b) Rear party-The rear party a subdivision of the support
follows and protects the support It endeavors to delay
a closely pursuing enemy by long-range fire It covers the
withdrawal of the rear point by engaging the enemy by fire
alone or by fire and movement When necessary it maneuvers
at distances up to about 800 yards on either side of
the axis of movement
(c) Support -The support is the smallest element of the
rear guard capablie:of offering the enemy serious resistance
It follows the reserve en route or the main body when no
reserve is present When no reserve is present it performs
the duties that normally devolve upon the reserve It delays
the enemy usually by means of long-range fire in successive
positions ; it covers the occupation of delaying positions by
the reserve ; it covers the withdrawal of the rear party by
60
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
38
fire alone or by fire and movement It may operate as much
as mile to either side of the route
(d) Reserve-The reserve normally the strongest element
of the rear guard constitutes its chief maneuvering force
It is a duty of the reserve in particular to detect the presence
of any hostile forces attempting an encircling maneuver
It delays the enemy by means of all available fire power and
when occasion demands by offensive action in cooperation
with the support In case the situation requires the rear
guard to effect a long delay of the enemy force the reserve
under protection of the support occupies strong delaying
positions It maneuvers as necessary to either side of the
route
k Artillery -Field artillery may be attached to the rear
guard for a regiment or larger unit When attached it generally
marches near the head of the largest element of the
rear guard Because of its great range artillery can force
the enemy off roads before he is within range of small arms
fire and can compel him to march across country in deployed
formation or to use circuitous routes in order to obtain
cover
Aviation-While not normally attached to the rear
guard observation airplanes operate in close liaison with its
commander They keep him informed of the strength composition
location and movements of enemy forces They
assist whenever necessary in maintaining liaison between
the main body and the rear guard Some airplanes usually
are placed at the disposal of the artillery with rear guards
to observe their long-range fires
m Chemical troops-Detachments of chemical troops
may be attached to a rear guard for the purpose of delaying
the enemy by the use of persistent chemicals or other chemical
ammunition Smoke may also be used to assist the elements
of the rear guard in concealing their movements during
successive withdrawals When attached chemical troops
should march with the reserve
n Engineers-When available engineers should be attached
to the rear guard to complete demolitions or the installation
of obstacles which may have been prepared by
preceding engineer troops
o Medical troops -Sufficient medical troops are attached
439995`-42-5 6
38-39
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
to the forward elements of the rear guard to care for probable
casualties
p Medium tanks -Medium tank units may be attached to
the rear guard for an armored regiment or larger unit when
there is no artillery attached or when a mechanized threat
exists
q Mortars In the absence of chemical troops the attachment
of at least a platoon of mortars to the support of a rear
guard for a regiment or larger unit to furnish smoke is
desirable
r Reconnaissance units ( ) Divisional reconnaissance
units are seldom attached to rear guards In a withdrawal
divisional reconnaissance units between the enemy and the
rear guard keep the rear guard commander informed of the
strength composition location and movement of enemy
forces
(2) A portion of the regimental reconnaissance company
may frequently be attached When attached to rear guards
these units are of great assistance in performing flank reconnaissance
and in obtaining early information of encircling
maneuvers They generally move abreast of the rear guard
on parallel roads or cross country
s Trains -The unit trains of the rear guard should march
at the rear of main body In general maintenance elements
of the rear guard march as far to the rear as is consistent
with the tactical situation Usually maintenance vehicles
with the reserve will march at the rear of the reserve while
maintenance vehicles of other elements march at the head
of their respective units
t March outposts -Rear guards are used in forming march
outposts (See par 40 )
∎ 39 FLANK GUARDS-a General -( ) A flank guard is a
security detachment detailed to protect the flank of a marching
force The fundamentals covering flank guards and
flank guard action are contained in FM 00-5
(2) Because of their high degree of mobility armored
units are especially suitable to perform flank guard duty
However tank units must not be used for that duty when such
employment will materially reduce their offensive power
or when other suitable troops are available for such duty
(3) When the protection usually afforded by adjacent units
62
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
39
or obstacles is absent a flank guard may be necessary
b Mission -The mission of a flank guard is to insure the
uninterrupted advance or retirement of a force and to protect
it from attack observation or harassment by hostile
ground forces from the flank Its duties are similar to those
of advance and rear guards
c Strength and composition -The strength and composition
of a flank guard varies according to the situation from
a patrol to a force of all arms When the main body executes
a flank march in proximity of the enemy flank protection
assumes great importance ; a strong flank guard is
detailed
d Distance-U) Since the mission of a flank guard is to
protect the flank of a marching column it is interposed between
this column and the located or anticipated hostile
threats The distance of operation to the flank will vary
depending upon the enemy composition terrain such as
defiles and obstacles and particularly upon adjacent roads
parallel to the route of the main force
(2) Large flank guards should be far enough out to the
flank to prevent hostile artillery or antitank weapons from
placing effective fire on the main body Small flank guard
patrol should be far enough out to protect the command
from enemy machine gun and antitank gun fire
(3) Distance between elements of the flank guard on the
march may conform to those between elements of an advance
or rear guard When continuous flank protection is required
the flank guard is distributed in detachments to give
protection throughout the length of the main body Critical
areas (key positions) controlling avenues of approach may
be occupied and held until the main body has passed (See
g below )
e Rate of march -( ) The rate of march of the flank
guard conforms generally to that of the main body
(2) When movement of the flank guard is by bounds the
rate of march will be based on the progress of the main body
or the time limit set by the main body commander for holding
specific localities or points
f Communication and control -( ) The communication
facilities afforded by the use of radio aviation motor and
motorcycle messengers enable the flank guard commander to
maintain contact with the main body
63
39 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(2) Where the terrain permits contact with the main body
may be maintained through connecting groups
(3) Contact is frequently gained with flank guards and
their movement controlled by the main body commander on
designated phase lines or objectives
(4) Communication and control are maintained between
subdivisions of the flank guard in the same manner as has
previously been outlined for advance guards
g Conduct of flank guard -( ) Flank guards are conducted
with especial reference to routes or localities which favor
attack against the flanks of a command
(2) When a route generally parallel to the line of march
of the main body exists and more or less continuous flank
protection is required throughout the depth of the column
during the march the flank guard marches parallel to the
main body to cover possible routes of hostile attack Except
as indicated below it is distributed in echelons over
sufficient depth to offer resistance to attack at various points
on the flank of the main body and to prevent inroads of
small hostile detachments
(3) When the locality from which an attack is to be expected
is well defined a flank guard occupies a key position
covering the routes of approach to the main body until the
command has passed
(4) When several such locations must be passed during
the progress of a march echelons of the flank guard move
by bounds from one position to another
(5) Upon arrival at a locality dispositions are made to
hold that position as long as may be necessary to allow the
main body to march out of danger The flank guard or
echelon thereof then moves to the next locality
(6) When the enemy is encountered the flank guard may
act offensively delay in successive positions or defend a
position as the situation may require
(7) In addition to the normal methods of performing flank
guard duties where considerable doubt exists as to the most
likely avenue of hostile approach a flank guard may resort
to a position of readiness at some conveniently located point
If sufficiently strong it may occupy two or more key positions
covering the most probable routes of approach In the latter
case a highly mobile reserve should be held at a convenient
6 4
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
39-40
location to move rapidly to oppose the enemy when his line
of approach is known
h Artillery -Artillery is usually attached to flank guards
required to operate beyond effective supporting distance of the
artillery in the main column or to combat hostile forces
likely to be accompanied by mechanized elements
i Medium tanks -Medium tank units may be attached to
large flank guards for a combat command or division when
there is danger of attack by hostile mechanized elements
5 Aviation -Although observation airplanes are not normally
attached to flank guards they cooperate with them in
the same manner as with advance guards and rear guards
In some situations flank guards may be supported by combat
aviation
k Other auxiliary troops -Other auxiliary troops such as
engineer chemical warfare and medical units are attached
in accordance with their need as the situation in each instance
may demand
Reconnaissance units -( ) Divisional reconnaissance
units are seldom attached to flank guards In a withdrawal
these units cooperate with or may even supplant flank guards
(2) A portion of the regimental reconnaissance unit may
frequently be attached When attached to flank guards these
units are used to conduct reconnaissance to locate hostile
threats or to seize and hold critical points prior to their
occupation by the flank guard proper Exceptionally may they be employed to delay the enemy from localities too
distant for the flank guard to occupy
m Trains -Unit trains of the flank guard march with the trains of the main body The maintenance elements of units
performing flank guard duty accompany their units
IN 40 OUTPOSTS -a General -( ) An outpost is a security
detachment to protect a resting command or a defensive position
against annoyance surprise and observation by ground
forces
(2) The presence of hostile mechanized units necessitates
all-around security
(3) In order to obtain cover and concealment against air attack units may ha5e to disperse over a large area
(4) When armored force units are attached to other ground forces they may depend upon the general security furnished
65
40 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
by the force to which they are attached However they provide
their own local security including security against hostile
mechanized elements and aviation
(5) When operating alone or at too great a distance from
the force to which they are attached to be furnished adequate
security by them armored force units provide their own allaround
security This paragraph covers the security of
armored force units when they furnish their own security
b Types-( ) Outposts at halt and in bivouac -At a halt
during the course of a march the advance guard or rear
guard or both establish a march outpost consisting of observation
posts at commanding points and combat patrols at
critical terrain features The support usually furnishes this
outpost In bivouac while the outpost is being established
advance flank and rear guards provide security
(2) Combat outposts-When operations are interrupted by
a halt for reorganization or by nightfall and troops are required
to bivouac in battle formation companies or battalions
cover their sectors by means of a security detachment termed
a combat outpost Provision is made for patrolling the foreground
and intervals between tactical localities Contact with
the enemy must be maintained The action of the several
combat outposts is coordinated by the commander of the
whole force The flanks and rear must also be covered with
security detachments
c Strength and composition-( ) The strength and composition
as well as the disposition organization and conduct
of an outpost depend upon the following considerations :
(a) Special mission assigned the outpost i e march combat
or outpost for a prolonged halt
(b) Proximity strength composition mobility and attitude
of the enemy
(c) Size and composition of the whole command
(d) Tactical dispositions of the main body
(e) Front to be covered and the distance of the outpost
from the main body
(f) Nature of the terrain especially the road net and
natural obstacles
(2) Strength -An outpost is given sufficient strength to
enable it to accomplish its mission but is made no stronger
than is consistent with reasonable security
(3) Composition -Outposts for large armored force units
6 6
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE

are composed principally of infantry ments and machine gun ele- augmented by reconnaissance artillery and engineer elements In smaller units such as an armored regiment they are normally composed of machine gun elements For armored units smaller than a regiment see chapter 5 d Outpost dispositions -The degree of organization of the Outpost depends upon whether or not contact with the enemy is remote or imminent or whether forces are in actual con- tact The basic consideration is that a command must not allow itself to be surprised
( ) When contact is remote -The time distance from the enemy varies with the rate of march of the enemy troops that may move against the command When contact is remote security is provided by far reaching reconnaissance ; by depth of depositions and location of units in the bivouac ; and by sending out detached posts to hold critical points on routes of approach from the front flanks and rear These detached posts preferably are along some protective terrain line that the enemy will be forced to pass in his advance (defiles stream crossings) They provide local security by posting outguards and sending out patrols Additional out- guards are posted near the bivouac area (2) When contact is imminent -When the enemy is so close that contact can be expected at any moment a more highly organized Outpost system is prescribed Combat units may be assigned sectors for which to furnish security These sectors are assigned by the senior commander and include the bivouac area of the combat unit When sectors are so assigned the dispositions of troops in the bivouac area must be such that combat units encircle the noncombatant elements present ; and sectors must be contiguous When necessary portions of the main body are held in readiness for immediate action
(3) In close contact with enemy -When in close contact with the enemy a complete Outpost is organized as described in subsequent subparagraphs Such circumstances will be exceptional since armored force units when they pass to the defensive should be replaced by other ground forces and withdrawn to conserve their strength for a resumption of the offensive (See ch ) However when armored force units in contact with the enemy have outdistanced the ground forces to which they are attached it may be necessary to
67
40
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
bivouac to assemble and to reorganize and service the vehicles
pending relief by other ground forces Either an
organized outpost or combat outposts will then have to be
established depending upon the hostile situation The provisions
outlined in FM 00-5 pertaining to supports outguards
sentinels detached posts and patrols applicable to
outpost dispositions are made
e Organization of outposts -An outpost position should be
selected because of its facilities for observation and its suitability
for defense Two lines are usually established I e
a line of observation and a line of resistance The position is
organized in depth in such manner as to place between the
main body and the enemy a series of groups which the enemy
must attack successively as he advances The closer to the
main body the stronger the group
( ) Line of observation The line of observation consists
of small groups (outguards) charged with observing and reporting
any hostile advance This line is extended well to the
front on terrain commanding an unobstructed view of the
front particularly avenues of approach and of the intervening
terrain
(2) Line of resistance -The outpost line of resistance consists
of larger groups (supports) posted on the best defensive
ground encircling the bivouac areas During the hours of
daylight the outpost line of resistance for armored force units
of a regiment or larger are usually at some distance from
the main body Full advantage is taken of all obstacles At
night since it is not practical to build up a line of resistance
in advance of the bivouac by attempting to maneuver heavier
elements of the command forward to that line during the
hours of darkness the line of resistance may be increased in
strength ; or the line of resistance may be established by the
disposition of combat units in bivouac This may be obtained
by providing close-in protection with the guns of the vehicles
sighted for all-around defense with personnel bivouacked at
their vehicles
(3) Subdivisions of outposts-The usual subdivisions of an
outpost from rear to front are reserve supports and outguards
In case of attack the primary duty of each subdivision
in front is to gain time for the element next in rear
to prepare for action Elements in rear reinforce elements
in front In occupying their positions and during relief the

various subdivisions of the outpost conceal their movements
against both air and ground observation The outpost troops
ordinarily stand relieved when the support of the advance
guard passes the outpost line of resistance
(a) Reserve-The reserve which constitutes the main
force of the outpost is held at some central point from
which it can support the troops on the main line of resistance
It renders support by reinforcement or by counterattack
In case the outpost is assigned a delaying mission it holds
a rallying position upon which the more advanced elements
may retire in the event of a hostile attack in force Its
strength varies from one-fourth to two-thirds of the outpost
strength The reserve is marched to its post by its commander
who then sends out such detachments as have been
ordered and places the remainder at rest He stations sentinels
at the post of the reserve He establishes connection
with the supports and nearby detached posts Each unit of
the reserve is informed of its place of formation and action
in case of hostile attack and the general action expected
of the reserve
(b) Supports -The supports constitute a line of supporting
and resisting elements They are usually located on or
near the line of resistance along prominent terrain features
or clearly defined points such as buildings bridges or road
Junctions so as to cover likely avenues of approach Strength
is concentrated at the most important points the remainder
being covered by small detachments patrols and weapons
previously sighted in positions Supports vary in strength
from a platoon to a company The strength armament terrain
and extent of the outpost sector control the distance
between adjacent supports Each support is organized as
a defense area It commands an adequate field of fire the to front and the intervals between adjacent supports
Each support is assigned a sector clearly defined by means of readily distinguishable terrain features Sector bound- aries are so arranged and so designated that responsibility
for covering roads sensitive points and likely avenues of hostile approach is never divided Supports are numbered
consecutively from right to left in the outpost Each sup- port commander stations at least one sentinel at the post of the support details outguards to cover the front of the sup-

port and makes provision for patrolling- including visiting
lateral patrols
(c) Outguards -Outguards are detailed from supports to
occupy vantage points on the line of observation They vary
in strength from four men to a platoon depending on their
location distance from the support and the number of
sentries they are to furnish An outguard of four men includes
a leader and maintains three reliefs of single sentinels
A squad posted in observation maintains single or double
sentinels Larger outguards protect themselves by sentinel
posts of half squad or squad groups and patrols depending
on the situation At night it is frequently advisable to place
outguards in positions different from those occupied during
the day Outguards are numbered consecutively from right
to left in each support The number and size of outguards
employed will depend upon the strength of the support terrain
and actions of the enemy Outguards must be ready
for action at all times In every case the outguard commander
must understand what he is to do in an emergency
Vehicles of the outguard may be with the support or kept
under cover near the outguard
(d) Sentinels -Sentinels are posted from outguards either
singly or in pairs On sentinel posts from the larger outguards
it is customary to use one sentinel in the daytime and
two at night Sentinels are located in concealed positions
which afford an unobstructed view They must be near
enough to their leader to attract his attention without leaving
their post They are charged with the observation of a
portion of the foreground of the outpost position with the
discovery of hostile activity and with giving the alarm in
case of attack Sentinels are given the following information
:
Number of their relief outguard and support
2 Direction and probable route of approach of the
enemy
3 Names of features of military importance such as
roads villages or streams
4 Location of the support or other units of which the
outguard is an outpost element and the location of
adjacent outguards

(4) Detached posts -Detached posts are observation and
combat groups detailed for the purpose of occupying points
which possess special importance to the security of the command
but which are too remote to be included in the normal
outpost organization Detached posts are given sufficient
strength to maintain themselves and to furnish the necessary
observation
Distances -Because of the mobility organic fire power
and facilities for rapid communication of armored force
units the distance between subdivisions of the outpost may
be considerably greater than in less mobile troops Armored
force units can quickly support an outpost line of resistance
at a distance from the bivouac of a command The line of
observation when practicable should be at sufficient distance
to keep hostile light artillery beyond the range of the
bivouac area
9 Communication and contact-( ) Communication between
the main body and the outpost and between subdivisions
of the outpost are maintained in the same general
manner as has been previously described for all security
detachments
(2) Within the outpost position contact with advance elements
and with adjacent supports and outguards is maintained
by patrols
(3) Visual signals such as ground projector signals or
improvised alarms may be utilized in accordance with a prearranged
code to warn of the approach of hostile ground or
air forces
h Conduct -The conduct of an outpost depends primarily
on the contemplated employment of the main body The
plan of action of the main body may require the line of
resistance to be held at all costs or the outpost and security
detachments may be required to delay in order to afford the
main body time to prepare for action or withdrawal The
course of action to be followed is prescribed by the commander
of the force
i Obstacles -Obstacles (road blocks) constructed from
7
40
material found on the ground are placed on roads in front
of outguards and supports where they may effectively delay
the enemy advance Such obstacles must be covered by
fire Obstacles are placed by the outpost troops with the
assistance of engineers They are located to take full advantage
of defiles Mines are used freely (See FM 5-30 )
j Terrain -Terrain feature are utilized to the maximum
extent in providing protection and in making dispositions
Terrain should be selected for positions that will cover avenues
of approach provide an adequate field of fire to the
front and cover the interval between adjacent elements
Covered routes of withdrawals from positions should be selected
and reconnoitered in advance
k Vehicles -The minimum number of vehicles necessary
for patrolling communication and transportation of personnel
remain with the subdivisions of the outpost When
not employed they are concealed Remaining vehicles are
left with the vehicles of their unit
Identification of friendly vehicles -Some means of identifying
friendly vehicles approaching outguards from the direction
of the enemy must be improvised and understood
by all sentinels and the crews of vehicles A simple prearranged
code that can be flashed by a light and seen at a
distance will serve to warn of the approach of friendly vehicles
at night Along routes that are likely to be used by
vehicles It may often be preferable to post an additional
sentinel a hundred yards or so in advance of the outguard
to flash a light on all vehicles to insure identification If
an enemy vehicle is identified the outguard is warned by
the sentinel giving a prearranged signal
m Artillery-Support of the outpost troops is usually provided
by the artillery with the main body or that assigned
to the defense of the main position Batteries are specially
designated for this purpose in case such action is contemplated
If such support is impractical artillery may be
attached to the outpost
n Aviation -Observation aviation provides additional surveillance
and cooperates with outpost troops in the same
manner as with advance flank and rear guards
o Engineers -Engineers are attached to the outpost as
required for the repair or destruction of bridges and roads
and for the construction of obstacles mine fields and other
barriers

40
p Other auxiliary troops -Other auxiliary troops such as
chemical warfare and medical units are attached to large
outposts in accordance with their needs as the situation in
each case demands
q Reconnaissance units -( ) Divisional reconnaissance
units are seldom attached to outposts They execute distant
reconnaissance regulated by the higher commander (See
sec II )
(2) A portion of the regimental reconnaissance unit may
be attached to extend the zone of reconnaissance of an outpost
to the front and flanks
(3) All reconnaissance elements maintain close contact
with the enemy when combat outposts or outposts for the
night are established During the hours of darkness unless
an emergency calls for other action reconnaissance elements
not in contact are habitually withdrawn to the bivouac area
of the main body Elements in contact with the enemy
maintain observation of the enemy with the minimum personnel
required while the remainder of the element rests
in concealed bivouac in the vicinity
r Trains -Trains of outpost elements remain at the service
park of their unit bivouac
s Supply and maintenance -The feeding of personnel and
maintenance of vehicles on outpost duty in armored force
units at a distance from their bivouac areas and service
parks may offer a difficult problem The following methods
may be taken as a guide :
( ) Rations fuel and lubricants may be transported in
containers to the various elements Necessary servicing is
performed by the crews with vehicles concealed at the outpost
position
(2) In proximity to or in close contact with the enemy
feeding and servicing may have to be accomplished prior
to the element being posted if sufficient warning is given
or after the element has been relieved from outpost duty and
has been withdrawn Elements may have to exist on their
reserve rations and carry the necessary fuel and lubricants
in containers with them in the combat vehicles
(3) When practical and at not too great a distance from
the element in rear : personnel and vehicles may return to
the rear element in relays for feeding and servicing
(4) Maintenance other than first echelon maintenance
73
40-4
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
normally is not performed at outpost positions If such maintenance
is essential vehicles requiring it should be replaced
by other vehicles prior to going on outpost duty
a 4 CoUNTERRECONNAISSANcE -a General -( ) Counterreconnaissance
includes the measures to screen a command
from hostile observation Armored force units when operating
alone provide when necessary their own counterreconnaissance
screen The screening of other troops by
armored units is usually incidental to other missions
(2) Counterreconnaissance missions may be assigned
whether the force to be screened is advancing withdrawing
moving laterally or is at a halt
(3) Air superiority is essential to prevent observation by
hostile aviation
b Missions and duties -Counterreconnaissance missions
may be to screen a force in movement (moving screen) ; or
to screen the disposition or concentration of troops (stationary
screen) Specifically the duties of counterreconnaissance
elements are :
( ) To prevent hostile patrols from working through the
screen
(2) To prevent a hostile penetration in force
(3) To engage the enemy in such a manner as to prevent
or limit his observation of a certain area or beyond a certain
line
c Strength -The strength of a screening force as well as
the number of security detachments employed and the frontage
and depth to be covered depends upon the following
principal factors :
( ) Strength composition dispositions and mobility of
the enemy
(2) Kind of screen to be established i e moving or stationary
(3) Size and tactical dispositions of the force being
screened
(4) Nature of the terrain particularly the road net
d Composition --Counterreconnaissance in an armored
division is executed principally by reconnaissance infantry
and attached aviation elements while the remaining combat
elements of the division reinforce from a central location
the screen as necessary In smaller units such as an
74
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
4
armored regiment it is normally executed by reconnaissance
and tank units Units smaller than a regiment may have
appropriate elements attached for the purpose
e Organization o/ counterreconnaissance screen -When a
commander assigns a counterreconnaissance mission to a
force he may designate a zone or sector to be covered by
the counterreconnaissance screen This zone or sector is covered
by security detachments known as counterreconnaissance
detachments which in turn send out counterreconnaissance
patrols Reconnaissance to a distance beyond the
screen under the control of the commander of the counterreconnaissance
force is performed by reconnaissance units
The main body of the counterreconnaissance force marches
or remains in a central location behind the counterreconnaissance
detachments It supports the counterreconnaissance
detachments as the situations may require
/ Zones and sectors -( ) If the mission calls for screening
a moving force a zone of action is usually prescribed
(2) If the mission calls for the establishment of a stationary
screen 'the instructions designate the general line and
sector to be screened A stationary screen is similar to an
outpost
g Frontage and depth -( ) A counterreconnaissance force
is disposed to cover the entire front and in sufficient depth
to give the commander thereof time to concentrate an adequate
force to prevent a hostile penetration of the screen
Those parts of the front or area most vulnerable to hostile
reconnaissance receive special attention in the disposal of
the counterreconnaissance force
(2) The following may be taken as a guide for the frontage
that can normally be effectively covered in a moving screen
by units of the infantry or reconnaissance elements of the
armored division :

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(3) In a stationary screen these frontages may be increased
by approximately 25 percent
h Moving and stationary counterreconnaissance (l) In
a moving screen the elements of a counterreconnaissance
force usually move by bounds Patrols operating on a broad
front move from one coordinating or phase line at specified
times to another Counterreconnaissance detachments
keeping within supporting distance of their patrols and the
main body move from one suitable defensive terrain feature
to another In marches of more than one column the movement
of the main body is usually coordinated by the designation
of specific lines to be reached by heads of columns
at specified hours
(2) In a stationary screen counterreconnaissance elements
are posted to block the advance of the hostile reconnaissance
Maximum advantage is taken of terrain obstacles and defended
road blocks Patrols must be supported promptly to
prevent penetration of the screen
i Counterreconnaissance detachments -( ) The duties of
counterreconnaissance detachments are primarily to prevent
reconnaissance by the enemy's ground troops and to deny
the transmission of information to the enemy They are
habitually assigned zones of action or sectors
(2) The strength of a counterreconnaissance detachment
depends chiefly upon the width of the zone of action or
the frontage assigned and the number of patrols it must
furnish to accomplish its mission These in turn depend upon
the strength of the hostile forces likely to be encountered
the terrain and road net and the nature of the screen to
be established The strength may vary from a platoon to
a battalion
(3) In general counterreconnaissance detachments will
normally be used to :
(a) Prevent smaller hostile patrols from penetrating the
zone of action or sector assigned
(b) Destroy or drive off small hostile detachments
(c) Locate and delay the advance of larger detachments
(d) Reinforce or form rallying points for their own
patrols
(e) Maintain liaison within that part of the screen established
by the detachment as well as with adjacent detachments
76 439995'-42-e
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE

(i) Reconnoiter locally to the front and flanks of the
detachment
(g) Furnish information to the commander of the body main
(4) Personnel and weapons are employed in accordance
with the principles of their use in offensive and defensive
action by small units
j Counterreconnaissance patrols --( ) The principle duties of the patrols are to locate and destroy hostile patrols and to warn the counterreconnaissance detachments of the presence
and movement of larger hostile detachments that are
beyond the capability of the patrol to destroy They delay
such detachments The strength of a patrol varies from half
a squad to a platoon with its organic weapons Normally
vehicles operate in pairs
(2) In general the conduct of counterreconnaissance patrols
whether in moving or in stationary screens is similar
(a) In a moving screen patrols move along routes which
enable them to keep under observation the likely routes of hostile advance They patrol laterally to adjacent patrols (b) In stationary screens patrols are posted at observation points from which they can view routes of hostile approach Active patrolling between adjoining groups is maintained k Instructions to counterreconn¢issance detachments - Instructions to the commander of the detachment include ; ( ) Time of starting
(2) Zone of action (for moving screen)
(3) Sector and line of observation and defense (stationary screen)
(4) Coordinating lines and time to be passed (for moving screen)
(5) Special reconnaissance desired
(6) Procedure if enemy is met in force
(7) Lines of communication ; responsibility for liaison be- tween detachments
Methods of operation -In performing counterreconnais- sance missions units seek to defeat or neutralize hostile re- connaissance forces In the execution of this mission they operate offensively defensively or by delaying action re- sorting to all forms of combat when necessary Hostile avia- tion is fired upon within range unless prohibited in orders
77
4 -42
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
( ) Counterreconnaissance detachments attack hostile
detachments whenever and wherever found
(2) When hostile reconnaissance forces are superior in
strength or the screen must cover a broad front the screening
force may have to resort to defensive or delaying action
as a means of temporarily impeding the operations of hostile
reconnaissance forces Defensive action is most effective
when the screen or an element thereof can be established
behind an obstacle such as a stream defile or road block
which must be crossed or passed by the enemy
an Artillery -The artillery with armored force units on a
counterreconnaissance mission is used to support the screening
force When the screen is moving artillery generally
accompanies the main body In cases where the defense of
a screen has become necessary or advisable all or part of the
artillery may be placed in position for the support of the
screen or may be held with the main body prepared to move
to the support of any part of the screen which may be
threatened
n Aviation -Aviation assists counterreconnaissance forces
by attacking hostile aviation attempting to cross the area
of counter reconnaissance by reporting hostile ground movements
especially the movement of approaching highly mobile
units and by attacking hostile attempts in force to
penetrate the screen
o Trains Trains of units composing the counterreconnaissance
screen remain with the trains of the main force
0 42 SECURITY AGAINST HOSTILE AVIATION --a General:( )
Hostile aviation presents a menace to operations of armored
force units by attacking them or observing and rendering
reports on their presence location and activity to enemy
ground forces
(2) Armored force units may frequently operate under the
protection of supporting air units or may even have attached
to it combat aviation and antiaircraft artillery for
defense against hostile aircraft (See FM 00-5 ) Regardless
of the security measures taken or furnished by the
higher command all armored force units must be alert to
the probability of hostile air attack or reconnaissance and
must provide appropriate security measures for its own protection
(3) Antiaircraft protection of a column depends initially
78
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
42
on the efficiency of the concealment in its last bivouac
Special security measures must be taken during the time of
exit from bivouac while passing through defiles at temporary
halts and during movement into assembly areas or
bivouac
(4) The principal security measures employed by armored
force units against hostile aviation include passive measures
such as night marches concealment and dispersion or distribution
into small units or groups; active measures ; and
the construction of slit trenches for all personnel except crews
of turreted vehicles
b Warning service -( ) The first requirement of antiaircraft
security is an adequate warning service Warning
of the approach of hostile aviation is provided for as follows :
(a) By air and ground reconnaissance units whose routine
missions include reports on hostile aircraft (See sec II )
(b) By detailing air scouts from all units Air scouts consist
of designated personnel in each unit whose duty observe is to for hostile aircraft and give timely warning On the
march they observe from the vehicle to which they are regularly assigned At the halt they are posted near their
units
Se) Where observation is limited because of the character
of the terrain such as in a defile a flank patrol may be posted or detailed to march along high ground parallel to the column for the specific purpose of warning of the approach
of hostile aircraft
(2) All personnel must be trained in the identification of
hostile aircraft
(3) The air alarm may be transmitted by radio improvised
visual signal prescribed whistle signal firing weapons (see
FM 7-5) or voice Any one or all the methods may be used depending upon the distance at which the warning is given from the command and whether or not the engines of vehicles are running
(4) Upon receiving the air alarm warning or signal units and personnel are governed by the following rule§ :
(a) While marching large armored force units cannot expect to keep from being observed Since the normal dis- persion of turreted vehicles renders such units an unfavorable target for air attack they continue in motion However if the column consists of open vehicles or these vehicles are
79
42
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
intermingled with turreted vehicles all will halt without
closing up and all possible small arms fire will be brought to
bear on the attacking airplanes Personnel in open vehicles
not manning antiaircraft weapons will disperse dismounted
Movement will be resumed as soon as practicable after the
hostile airplanes have passed Small groups such as patrols
or trucks moving by infiltration cease movement in the
open since they are primarily interested in escaping detection
and are not likely to be subject of an air attack When
columns halt vehicles are moved off the road whenever possible
to cover and are immediately camouflaged This is
done even though the halt is for only a few minutes
(b) In an assembly position or in a bivouac area personnel
remain motionless until the "all clear" signal is given
If early warning has been received they may seek cover
and remain motionless Men are trained not to look up
as faces are easily detected At night it is especially important
that these precautions be observed when hostile
aviation uses flares to illuminate an area In addition all
lights not completely concealed should be extinguished during
the period of the air alarm
c Night marches Large armored force units in the combat
zone can best escape detection from the air by marching
during the hours of darkness These night marches are
made without lights or with the use of tactical lights only
d Concealment -The presence and position of troops are
disclosed to an air observer by movement regular formation
or outline reflection of light dust smoke or newly made
tracks and installations Measures taken for concealment
aim to defeat both visual reconnaissance and photography
from the air These measures and the rules governing concealment
are covered in detail in section I Extensive artificial
camouflage rarely will be practicable (See FM 5-20 )
e Dispersion :-A command diminishes its vulnerability to
air observation and attack by adopting dispersed formations
and by distribution into small units or groups Dispersion
may be accomplished by increased width and depth of formations
; by moving in multiple columns ; by distribution in
assembly or bivouac areas into small units or groups to take
advantage of cover ; by halting at extended distances by
clearing roads and moving under nearby cover ; and by in-
80
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE

creased speed of movement between successive terrain lines
affording cover
f Antiaircraft fdre -All units provide immediate protection
against low flying hostile aircraft by using their antiaircraft own weapons and other weapons suitable for fire against aircraft
( ) All antiaircraft weapons are alerted for antiaircraft
fire at all time Troops and personnel charged specifically
with the duty of antiaircraft firing are constantly prepared for immediate action Organic weapons provided for the purpose protect trains in movement and in service parks
(2) Fire is opened promptly upon enemy airplanes within effective range except from a concealed position where it is desirable to maintain secrecy and firing might disclose the presence of troops
g Air-borne troops -The threat from air-borne troops parachute and air-landing requires that special security measures be instituted against them Responsibility for these measures extends down through all echelons of com- mand the measures adopted within each echelon being co- ordinated in such a way as to provide a unified system over the entire danger area In general the security measures adopted are designed to gain early information ; to attack incoming enemy transports by combat aviation and antiair- craft fire ; to destroy parachute troops while in the act of landing when they are most vulnerable or immediately after ; to obstruct all possible landing fields (airdromes open fields and straight stretches of level highway) ; and to isolate and destroy all forces that land by Immediate attack before they can be resupplied and reinforced with supporting weapons See FM 00-5 and 00- 5
h Summary -In order to provide its own antiaircraft security armored force units must ;
( ) Provide timely warning of the approach of hostile airplanes
(2) Rely on dispersed formations or make such appropri- ate use of cover or concealment as conditions offer (3) Keep antiaircraft guns ready for immediate action at all times
(4) Be skillful in the antiaircraft use of its own fire weapons and open fire promptly upon enemy airplanes except

42-43
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
when security is to be gained through concealment rather
than fire protection
(5) Determine when security depends on fire power or on
concealment
0 43 SECURITY AGAINST HOSTILE MECHANIZED FORCES a
General -The inherent characteristics of armored units (mobility
fire power armor protection and shock action) provide
the primary means of protection against hostile mechanized
attacks Certain armored force units however do
not have this protection and additional means are frequently
necessary for their protection as well as for the security of
the command as a whole These additional security measures
are active and passive generally used in combinations
They supplement the normal security detachments provided
for the security of the command as a whole
( ) The active means available to armored force units
include employment of tank destroyer artillery chemicals
and the counterattack Combat aviation when attached
may also be employed (See FM 00-5 )
(2) The principal passive means employed include con
cealment natural and artificial obstacles demolitions and
antitank mines
b Reference -FM 00-5 covers the methods employed to
warn of mechanized threats and the use of antitank guns
artillery and chemicals
c Concealment -The rules set forth in section I governing
cover and concealment apply to all armored force units
d Natural obstacles -Terrain which is unsuitable for the
employment of hostile mechanization is also unsuitable for
the employment of friendly armored force units for offensive
action Consideration therefore must be given to the probable
employment of friendly armored force units Natural
obstacles which restrict the offensive operations of these
units are avoided However the defensive possibilities of
terrain must be studied constantly from the viewpoint of
protection and antimechanized defense in order to utilize
existing natural obstacles to the maximum extent
( ) A map study supplemented by air and ground reconnaissance
may disclose avenues of approach and natural
obstacles such as streams lakes marshes thick woods and
mountainous country which will impede or restrict enemy
82
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
43
mechanized operations During marches halts or when in
Position full use is made of those terrain features restrict the which approach of hostile mechanized vehicles When the enemy's approach is limited to a few routes 'crossing
a natural barrier protection is obtained by blocking these crossings
(2) When approaches are favorable to enemy mechanized
elements and march columns are exposed chief reliance must be placed on active means of providing security
(3) Tank destroyer and artillery units when employed
on antimechanized missions take advantage of local natural obstacles including buildings walls and stump covered or rocky areas
e Artificial obstacles -Artificial obstacles such as barri- cades demolitions and antitank mines normally are em- ployed by armored force units only to block crossings defiles and other routes of approach of hostile mechanized vehicles ; to provide additional security of bivouac areas ; and for local defense of tank destroyer and artillery units and weapons on antimechanized missions
( ) Engineers with armored force units are charged with the placing and construction of major artificial obstacles (For details see FM 5-30 ) When artificial obstacles are em- ployed their location must be coordinated with natural obstacles and with the fire of antitank and other weapons The main effort in the construction of artificial obstacles is made on those parts of the front possessing natural ob- stacles which are susceptible of improvement The bulk of the antitank guns are placed to cover the avenues favorable for tank action A barrier or obstacle loses much of its defensive value unless covered by fire of supporting troops Removal of obstacles can be impeded by contamination with
persistent chemical agents In general obstacles demoli- tions mines and persistent gas contaminations are located where the enemy will come upon them suddenly and be unable to avoid them
(2) Demolitions and mines are useful for quickly blocking defiles and principal avenues of approach They constitute a means for canalizing a hostile mechanized attack Mines have the advantage over demolitions in that mines may pro- duce casualities both of personnel and vehicles The location of mines must be coordinated with natural and artificial
83
43-44
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
obstacles and with the fire of antitank guns and other
weapons
(3) Artificial obstacles demolitions antitank mines and
contaminated areas may restrict the movement of troops
which they are designed to protect A record must be made
of the location and extent of such measures when used so
that the necessary precautions may be prescribed for the
safety of friendly troops
(4) The construction of road blocks is covered in FM 5-30
(a) Employment-A road block is a barrier to block or limit
the movement of hostile vehicles along a road They are
used to protect the flanks of a marching column or an
encircling force ; to delay an enemy to give time and space
for deployment for combat or time to organize the defense ;
and as counterreconnaissance measures
(b) Location -Road blocks are located in defiles where
they cannot be readily avoided To be most effective a road
block should be located so that the enemy will come upon
it suddenly A position immediately around a bend where
vegetation shields it from view of approaching hostile elements
is preferable Covered or concealed positions from which
effective machine gun or antitank gun fire can cover the
obstacle are desirable
(c) Construction -Road blocks may be constructed by
engineers when available However all units must be trained
in the methods of constructing hasty obstacles and in their
removal
(d) Defense -Road blocks must be defended by fire
Strength of the defense depends upon the means available
and extent of delay desired The defense may vary from
two riflemen to several riflemen machine guns and selfpropelled
guns Guns are so placed that their fire will prevent
hostile troops from removing the obstacle or passing
around it Tank destroyer elements may be used The employment
of tanks to defend road blocks is unusual When so
used they should operate by section taking mutually supporting
positions to increase protection against stalking and
to permit rapid withdrawal
44 SECURITY AGAINST CHEMICALS -Security against chemicals
is conducted in accordance with the fundamentals prescribed
in FM 00-5 and procedure outlined in FM 2 -40
84
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
45-46
∎ 45 SUMMARY --a All armored force units must provide
themselves with the necessary security to protect themselves
at all times against surprise observation and interference by
hostile air and ground forces
b All security measures include an adequate warning service
to prevent surprise
c Security detachments between the enemy and the main
body are detailed to prevent observation by hostile ground
forces
d Protection of the main body against interference is
obtained by making security detachments sufficiently strong
to either defeat the enemy or to hold the enemy until the
main body gains time for deployment to meet the threat
e Reconnaissance is an essential element of security
f Terrain and the road net are important factors in the
security of a command
g A command's readiness for action is facilitated by the
distribution of units in the main body and prior plans to
meet enemy situations
h Special measures must be taken for protection against
hostile aviation and mechanized units and enemy chemical
attacks
i The use of armored troops on security missions except
for theii own security when others 'are available for this
duty is justified only under conditions of extreme emergency
It will be remembered that armored units are first last and
always offensive troops
SECTION IV
OFFENSIVE COMBAT
∎ 46 GENERAL --a Purpose Offensive combat has object for its the attainment of an objective by means of the attack The organization and equipment of armored force units are designed primarily for offensive combat Units must be im- bued with the spirit of the offensive and must be always on the alert to seize the opportunity for offensive action The at- tack of armored force units should be characterized by bold- ness and speed in striking sudden blows in the most favorable direction
b Scope -Armored force units are employed in accord- ance with the principles of large numbers surprise and ma- neuver (See FM 00-5 )
85
46
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
( ) Large numbers -They are employed in large numbers
in decisive areas which afford suitable terrain and sufficient
space to utilize fully their mobility and shock action Protection
against hostile air attack and antitank weapons is
a prerequisite of successful employment
(2) Surprise -Surprise is obtained by rapid maneuver
secrecy and deception By prompt delivery of the initial
blow the commander places his adversary at a disadvantage
and forces him on the defensive or prevents him from organizing
his defenses A rapid bold attack by a small force
may often accomplish more than a slower carefully coordinated
attack by a larger force By such an attack initiative
is taken from the enemy and his plans for attack or defense
disrupted
(3) Maneuver -The maneuver of units rapidly to project
shock action and protected fire power into the vital part of
hostile rear areas from an unexpected direction must be
sought in all attacks
c Use of terrain -Full advantage must be taken of terrain
favorable for movement concealment and use as observation
points Terrain suitable for operations should provide :
concealed apass=emblyppositiorns (areoas) coaveredcrouteshof
areas for attack sufficiently free of obstacles to permit
movement to objectives at speed and suitable positions and
observation for supporting artillery and other ground weapons
during the attack (See par 26 )
d Initiative -Initiative of subordinates plays a great part
in success in any action Commanders will often be confronted
especially when the situation is obscure with the
problem of making immediate decision and initiating prompt
action Time may but usually will not permit detailed reconnaissance
Mission type orders may be given and leaders
of small units must be relied upon to make a prompt
estimate of the situation arrive quickly at a decision and
promptly and energetically carry out that decision Decisions
made must be in conformity with the general missions
and intentions of the commander hence it is essential
that all commanders be informed of such missions and intentions
Calm and clear yet rapid thinking must be combined
with a high degree of initiative Snap judgment must
be avoided
e Fire and movement -( ) The principal means of attack
86
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
46
for armored force units is a combination of fire and movement to reduce enemy opposition By fire and movement is meant the advance by certain elements or units (maneuvering ele- ment) protected by the fire of other elements or units (base of fire) The object of this form of attack is to advance elements
or units to positions from which stationary fire will
annihilate enemy opposition or to a point where a swift
assault over a short distance strongly supported by fire can be launched to overrun the enemy position
(a) This method of attack is applicable in the largest armored force unit and down to and including the section
For example the regiment attacks by fire and movement
when the armored (tank) battalions advance under the cover of the base of fire established by its machine gun and mortar units and by supporting artillery
(b) Fire and movement is generally employed by the com- ponents of the maneuvering force when enemy fire is en- countered For example a platoon in the maneuvering force
when held up by fire furnishes its own base of fire consist- ing of one of its sections This section preferably from a partially deflladed position fires while the other section maneuvers to a forward position from which it in turn estab- lishes a temporary base of fire to cover the advance of the former
(c) Fire and movement is also employed in displacing for- ward by the force constituting the base of fire For exam- ple the elements of the 'self-propelled gun platoon and mortar platoon displace forward to a new position by echelons each echelon being protected in its advance by the fire from the elements remaining in position
(2) The elements or units constituting the base of fire
deliver fire from either vehicular or ground mounted weap- ons depending upon the cover and the field of fire availa- ble The vehicles of the maneuvering force advance by cov- ered routes where practicable ; weapons being fired from the vehicle when the enemy position is in view Where the terrain permits vehicles move into a partially defiladed position fire a small burst maneuver to a new position and repeat The 37-mm and 75-mm guns are normally fired when the' tank is halted Where the terrain is relatively flat and smooth a large burst of fire may be delivered while the vehicle is moving Even under the most favorable
87
46
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
terrain conditions fire will be more effective if the vehicle is
halted a few seconds while a small burst is fired and then
moves on Firing from moving vehicles should only be attempted
where a swift assault over open terrain for a short
distance (not over 200 yards) is desired ; casualties can only
be held down when this assault is given the maximum fire
support of supporting weapons
Tactical forms of attack -The tactical forms of attack
are covered in detail in FM 00-5 The mobility of armored
force units permits great latitude in the choice of direction
and method of attack Against forces of similar characteristics
and against strongly organized positions the turning
movement is the preferred form Against groups or
positions highly vulnerable to armored attack the attack
may be an envelopment of one or both hostile flanks preferably
the latter When the mission time terrain and
other factors do not favor an envelopment an attack against
the hostile front may be by a penetration A prompt direct
attack may be made to take full advantage of surprise or
of a temporarily favorable situation
g Tactical groupings -In attack 9the combat command
groups generally are disposed into four parts : a reconnaissance
force (consisting of organic reconnaissance units and attack
units) a striking force (the striking echelon consisting of
tanks with engineers attached) a supporting force (consisting
of the support echelon l e the infantry artillery and
tank destroyer units) and a reserve Whether the striking
force makes the initial attack or main attack will depend on
the terrain and the extent and dispositions of the hostile
antitank defenses
( ) Striking force -When terrain is favorable for tank
operation and hostile antitank defenses are not strong the
striking echelon supported by available combat aviation
makes the initial attack This attack is usually by envelopment
the supporting echelon being used as a holding force
or base of fire or a portion of the tank units may be used
for such holding or secondary attack The striking echelon
will make the initial attack in a penetration only when hostile
defenses are very weak or when given overwhelming air and
artillery support Engineers are usually attached to the
striking echelon Infantry may be attached
(2) Support force -When the striking force makes the
88
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
46
initial attack the support echelon follows to seize and hold
objectives taken by the striking echelon When terrain is unfavorable
for tank operation or antitank defenses are the strong support echelon supported by medium tank units may
lead the attack to secure ground from which the striking
echelon may attack The support echelon usually leads the attack in a penetration The support echelon may be used to make an attack initially to serve as a base of fire for the
striking force in an envelopment This attack serves to fix
the enemy and may attract his reserves In this manner it assists the advance of the enveloping or striking force (3) Reserve -A part of the command the reserve is held
out of the combat initially for employment by the commander
of the whole force in furtherance of his plan of attack or for
use according to the development of the action The reserve
is composed chiefly of tank units Its strength usually varies
from one-third to a small fraction of the command A maximum
is held out against an enemy composed of mechanized
troops or strong in antitank weapons Its employment will
vary with existing conditions and opportunities As soon as the reserve is committed a new reserve must be constituted
without delay
(a) The commander of the reserve must be in close communication
with the commander of the whole force
(b) In emergencies he must not hesitate to act without
waiting for orders keeping in mind the mission and general
plan of the commander He must maintain personal reconnaissance
and keep close contact with the attacking troops
He should anticipate possible uses of the reserve and prepare
tentative plans therefor
(c) The commanding officer of the reserve must conduct
timely reconnaissance of routes to probable localities for employment
or movement
(d) The reserve is located in a position from which it can best support the main effort and protect the flanks To support an envelopment the reserve is located towards the flank enveloped generally in rear of the main attack
(e) When the main attack force reaches the enemy or attains its objectives the reserve must be ready to take
advantage of the situation to give an added impetus to the
attack at a critical moment to clinch the victory or to resist
counterattack It may pursue a retreating enemy or tempo-
89
46 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
rarily occupy the ground captured The reserve must be prepared
to cover the withdrawal or reorganization of the main
attack force
h Employment of tanks ( ) General-In the attack the
mobility fire power and shock action of tanks are exploited
to the maximum Tank attacks will be costly or will result
in failure to reach their objective unless employed in decisive
numbers
(a) The width and depth of the formation depe~ds upon
the situation and terrain Terrain may limit the breadth of
the formation and force a unit to attack on a narrow front
When the situation is obscure or great power is needed to
overcome hostile resistance a deep formation is used This
formation gives the maximum control and flexibility When
a limited objective attack is to be made such as in withdrawal
a broad formation may be used This formation is difficult
to control Echelon formation is suitable for flank protection
units being echeloned toward the flank to be protected
(b) Tank units are arranged in the attack formation in
accordance with the plan of attack They advance to their
objectives by a combination of fire and movement Within
the platoons the intervals and distances between tanks is
not to be less than 50 yards when supporting other ground
troops ; otherwise not less than 75 yards The distance between
successive waves must not be less than 50 yards
(2) Light tanks -The primary mission of the light tank
units is to close with the enemy and to disrupt the hostile
organization in vital rear areas by fast bold action This
is accomplished by destroying hostile automatic weapons and
personnel ; disrupting communications ; and overrunning
command posts artillery positions reserves and other installations
essential to the enemy
(3) Medium tanks -(a) The primary mission of medium
tank units is to assist the attack of the light tank units
chiefly by neutralizing or destroying the hostile antitank
weapons When organized resistance is encountered especially
antitank guns medium tank units will usually precede
the light tank units for this purpose The use of one or more
platoons of medium tanks following the attack of light tank
units for supporting fire will frequently be desirable Tanks
so employed for short periods should assume turret defilade
rp
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
46
positions from which they can bring direct fire to bear hostile antitank on weapons as they are found
(b) Medium tanks also protect the light tanks against the attack of hostile tanks When the enemy is composed of mechanized troops a large medium tank component if avail- able is held in the reserve
(4) For further details on the employment of tanks see chs 5 7 2 and 3
i Heavy tank destroyer battalions -( ) Organization- This battalion consists of a headquarters company and three heavy tank destroyer companies The company has two heavy and one light platoon of four guns each
(2) Missions -(a) The mission of the tank destroyer with the armored division is to assist either by offensive or de- fensive action in the protection of the division against hostile mechanized forces
area
(3) Reconnaissance -Reconnaissance for positions and routes thereto is continuous during the advance Informa- tion gained is immediately transmitted to the battalion head- quarters or the company concerned Battalions and com- pany reconnaissance personnel supplements the reconnais- sance of units to which the battalion or its companies are attached Close cooperation must be maintained with obser- vation aviation
(4) Liaison -The battalion sends a liaison officer to the unit to which it is attached and each company sends liaison personnel to the unit to which it is attached Close liaison must be maintained in order that the tank destroyer units may act promptly
(5) Advance -During the advance the tank destroyer units move usually as a unit near the head of the unit to which they are attached A detachment or the whole battalion

be
(b)
(c)
The battalion may be used to-
Protect a bivouac assembly area or rallying point 2 Guard an exposed flank
3 Protect the rear of the division
The battalion may be used as a unit or companies may attached to armored regiments or combat Except commands
wheb actually emplaced to protect a bivouac assembly area or rallying point tank destroyer units should be held in mobile reserve prepared to move promptly to any threatened
46
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
may be used to guard an exposed flank In this case they
are usually attached to or act as flank guard When the
armored units go into assembly areas tank destroyers immediately
place guns in position to cover likely avenues of approach
for attacking armored units A portion of the battalion
or company is held in mobile reserve ready to reinforce
any threatened point
(6) During combat -Tank destroyer units may advance
behind the second echelon of attack usually the second armored
battalion in depth They are prepared to repel counterattacks
from the flanks and rear The greater part of the
unit should if terrain is suitable be near the exposed flank
(7) During reorganization -As the attack progresses the
tank units in rear will pass through the destroyer units to
enter combat After the objective is reached the tank destroyer
units move rapidly forward and cover the rallying
point to protect the reorganization
(8) In defense In defense the tank destroyer battalion
is usually kept intact in mobile reserve In such position that
it may move promptly to any threatened point to repel a
counterattack Tank destroyer units are not ordinarily attached
to lower units and emplaced as stationary antitank
guns in defense Their mobility is preserved
(9) Retrograde movements -In retrograde movements
tank destroyer units are usually attached to the rear guard
They are held mobile ready to repel enemy armored units
( 0) River crossings -In river crossings tank destroyer
units should cross the river immediately after the infantry in
order to repel hostile armored counterattacks
( ) The employment of the tank destroyer company is
covered in chapter 7
j Artillery -( ) Role -The role of the armored artillery
is to support the armored division and its elements in the
conduct of highly mobile ground warfare primarily offensive
in character
(2) Sources of fire missions-The sources of artillery fire
missions are :
(a) Artillery forward observers (with advance elements of
division) -The armored vehicle serves as an armored observation
post for these observers Radio is the means of
communication
(b) Air observation -Air observers report directly to the
92
439995°--42-7
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
46
particular artillery echelon with which they are functioning
Prearrangement of plans and definite assignment of zones of
responsibility for observation and fire are essential
(c) Artillery liaison officers -Artillery liaison officers accompany
the armored unit commanders Flexibility in plans
and fire support by the artillery are thus facilitated
(3) On the march -The armored division usually advances
in multiple columns When contact is imminent for any column
its advance guard moves on a broad front Artillery
usually supports this type of action by immediate occupation
of a position Continuous support is effected by displacement
by echelon The artillery must be prepared to place fire on
the principal routes leading toward the marching columns
from the front and flanks If no special use for the battery is
contemplated it Is left under artillery control with limitations
placed on its employment and displacement
(4) In assembly areas and bivouac -When armored are forces in assembly areas or bivouac artillery is posted to cover
all approaches to the area Positions are selected from which
it may bring long range interdiction fire on principal routes
of approach for hostile forces It performs counterbattery
missions if within -range of hostile artillery It supplements
the antitank defense of the area
(5) Attack of deliberately prepared hostile position - (a) Fires preceding attack-The division artillery officer is responsible for the coordination of all fire by the artillery
of the division (organic and reinforcing) A short preparation
may precede the attack
(b) Fires in support of the attack -Fires in support of the
attack are planned and executed as follows :
Limited objective -Same as (5) (a)
2 Unlimited objective-The mobility of the armored
division practically precludes complete coordination
of artillery fire in support of the attack Normally
decentralization is effected by attachment of
elements of the artillery to the armored echelons
(c) Normal artillery fires in support of the attack -These
fires include :
Counterbattery

of fires air and ground observation liaison and communica
tions and the vigorous forward displacement of the
batteries
(f) Artillery supports the tanks until they come in close
contact with hostile positions usually to about 300 yards

gives direct support Artillery of the encircling force takes
positions from which it may fire on retreating hostile forces
It supports the attack of tank units It assists in repelling
counterattacks made against the encircling force
k Mortar units -Mortar fire is coordinated with the artillery
fire to avoid duplication of effort Mortars place smoke
screens at the shorter ranges while the artillery fires smoke
at the longer ranges Infantry mortar units are employed
with the infantry elements Mortar platoons of armored
battalions operate with these units normally under centralized
control In some situations a section of the mortar platoon
may be attached to a subordinate unit For further details
on the employment of mortars of armored force units see
chapter 5
Aviation -( ) Operation of the armored force is facilitated
by control of the air Such control permits free movement
of units in the approach and makes possible the support
of an attack by bombardment aviation Lack of control
of the air although not prohibiting movement makes
operations much more difficult Pursuit aviation is employed
to deny the use of the air to hostile observation and
bombardment aviation
(2) Combat 'aviation supports armored force units by attacks
on hostile supply and command installations reserves
artillery antitank weapons and other resistance holding up
an attack In the advance combat aviation in close support
is used to attack and delay hostile columns In the attack
it supplements the fire of artillery against critical targets ;
attacks targets beyond the range of artillery ; gives close
support to attacking units that have advanced beyond range
of their supporting artillery ; and attacks hostile counterattacking
forces In pursuit it gives close support to pursuing
forces by attack on hostile resistances holding up the movement
; by attacking and delaying withdrawing hostile forces ;
and by destruction of bridges on routes of withdrawal In
defense it attacks hostile attacking forces reserves command
and supply installations
(3) Observation aviation performs battle reconnaissance as
previously discussed in this chapter It is also employed
during a crisis in combat to maintain liaison and coordination
between tanks artillery and combat aviation
m Infantry element -( ) Action of the armored infantry
95
46 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
in the attack varies Part or all of it may be employed in the
secondary attack A part of it may be attached to the
maneuvering element or be held in reserve It remains mobile
as long as the situation permits and then may be employed as
follows :
(a) To clarify or develop a situation such as attacking to
drive in hostile covering forces or attacking a hostile antitank
zone
(b) To seize terrain from which to launch a tank attack
(c) To make holding attacks while tank units envelop
(d) To follow closely the main attack to overcome the remaining
hostile resistance occupy and hold ground gained
(e) To cover the flanks against a hostile threat
(f) To constitute a new reserve
(g) To protect tank units during their reorganization after
the attack
(h) To protect tank units at night in movement or in
bivouac
(2) The fire of infantry supporting weapons is coordinated
with that of the artillery The fire of these weapons supplements
the artillery direct support fire chiefly by engaging
targets in the immediate foreground
n Engineer units -Engineer units may be employed with
the main or secondary attack forces to facilitate their movement
in the attack Engineer missions will include : removing
or assisting In the passage of obstacles and mine fields ; providing
means for crossing streams ; and protection of flanks
by means of obstacles demolitions and mines Engineer
troops engage in combat when necessary for the accomplishment
of their assigned work (For details see FM 5-30 )
o Use of chemicals -Because of the difficulty of establishing
and maintaining effective chemical concentrations in
mobile operations use of chemical agents other than smoke
by armored force units in the attack is limited The employment
of smoke must be limited carefully in respect to
both time and space and must be coordinated carefully with
other supporting fires and with the action of tanks and sup
porting aviation Under favorable conditions of wind and
weather smoke is used to blind hostile observation posts
antitank guns and infantry supporting weapons to conceal
the approach of the attacking elements and to protect the
96
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
46
flanks of the attack It is especially useful periods during short when troops must traverse exposed ground ' ( ) Smoke may be projected from artillery or mortar shell ; from aircraft or dischargers attached to tanks Smoke placed by mortars frequently will be more effective than artillery fire in neutralizing observation and hostile antitank gun fire within a particular area
(2) Partial loss of control and disorganization may result from tanks passing through smoke It must not be placed on tank objectives or on areas where tanks will be required to pass in the assault unless the wind conditions are such that it will be dissipated before the arrival of the tanks
p Coordination -( ) General-The commander is re- sponsible for coordination of all elements of his command Attacks launched directly from march columns without halt- ing or with a short halt may result In an uncoordinated attack loss of control and a sacrifice of some of the capabil- ities of artillery tanks and other supporting weapons Such attacks will usually be launched in a meeting engagement or against a retreating enemy They may be launched against
an inferior enemy against an enemy not fully organized for defense or against an enemy whose morale is low Ordi- narily an attack in a moving situation may be organized and
coordinated In assembly or intermediate positions
(2) During the attack the action of the light and medium
tank units must be coordinated with each other and with the action of the infantry and other supporting units The
fire of all supporting weapons must be coordinated wherever
practicable with the scheme of maneuver and plan of tank employment In all cases the maximum coordination per- mitted by the situation and time element is sought The measures to insure coordination are prescribed in the attack
order
(3) Line o/ departure -See FM 00-5 and appendix I (4) Intermediate position If the line of departure is at a considerable distance from the assembly position an inter- mediate position may be designated for coordinating the advance of all elements
(5) Attack position -An attack position on or immedi- ately in rear of the line of departure may be designated for the coordination of armored force units with other ground forces they are supporting
97
46
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(6) Rallying and alternate rallying points -Rallying and
alternate rallying points are designated where the unit
assembles after combat for the purpose of reorganization
Rallying and alternate points are announced for each objective
The rallying point is usually just in rear of the objective
The alternate rallying point is farther to the rear and
may be the attack or intermediate position In the exploitation
of a break-through a series of rallying points may be
designated along the axis of advance These are designated
before the movement starts Any change in direction of advance
will require the designation of new rallying points
(7) Obfectives -Each subordinate tank unit in the attack
chould be assigned a principal objective Suitable objectives
are :
(a) Hostile elements or installations the destruction of
which will disrupt most effectively the enemy operation
(b) Enemy reserves
(c) A decisive terrain feature
(8) Time of attack -The earlier an attack can be launched
after gaining contact with the enemy the less preparation
the enemy can make to meet it and the greater the possibility
of surprise Ordinarily the main attack by tank units
should not be started unless there is sufficient daylight remaining
to permit such units to reach their objective by
nightfall The time of the attack will depend chiefly upon
the enemy situation terrain and the time required to organize
and prepare for the attack
(a) The time of attack may be indicated by prescribing
a definite hour or by prescribing that the unit will attack
upon order (radio visual signal or other means) of the
commander ; or on reaching a certain line or terrain feature
(b) When the command attacks by an envelopment the
time of attack may be indicated by:
Prescribing a definite hour for each part of the
attacking force This method insures the best
coordination of the attack and should be used
whenever existing conditions render it feasible
2 A signal visual or otherwise This method may
be necessary when conditions of terrain and the
enemy situation are so vague or uncertain as to
render the prescribing of a definite hour impracticable
When employed care should be taken to
98
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
46
insure that the signal prescribed can be seen and
understood
3 Making the time of attack of one element dependent
upon the time or progress of attack of the other
This presupposes that the terrain over which the
attacks take place is clearly visible to one or both
elements or that close liaison exists Such a
method of time coordination may prescribe that
one element attack in conjunction with the other ;
when the attack of one element has been launched
the attack of the other is made at the same time
or at such time thereafter as to bring the full
weight of both attacks on the enemy
4 The secondary or main attack force being directed to
attack as soon as in position Frequently this may
be the only feasible method because of difficulties
of terrain uncertainty or rapidly changing conditions
in the enemy situation
(c) When the command attacks by a double envelopment
any one or combination of the foregoing methods may be
employed that are applicable
q Orders ( ) Attack orders for armored force units usually
are issued orally They are issued to the assembled staff
and available unit commanders prior to the separation of
the various elements for the attack When practicable orders
are issued at a point from which the objective can be
seen To those not present orders may be delivered as
appropriate orally by staff officer messengers by radio or
(written) by motorcycle messengers Fragmentary orders
are frequently used Orders are issued sufficiently far in advance
to permit subordinates as much time as possible for
reconnaissance for the preparation of plans and issuance of
their own orders For the form and details of the attack
order see FM 0 -5
(a) Orders will designate or prescribe as may be necessary-
intermediate assembly positions line of departure

of opening fire any limitations of fire forward displacement
and subsequent action
(2) When conditions require decentralization of command
is encouraged The initiative of subordinates is relied upon
The commander issues mission type orders to those tactical'
groupings in which command is decentralized and attaches
the means necessary to accomplish their tasks
(3) In armored force units it is particularly necessary that
smaller units be familiar with higher plans in order that they
may act promptly and correctly in any situation not covered
by orders Leaders must be enterprising and always ready to
seize opportunities for the employment of their commands in
furtherance of the plan of the higher commander
r Control -( ) The chief requirements of control during
the attack are simplicity of plans and formations rigid adherence
to the procedure of follow the leader reliable radio
and visual communication and prearranged rallying points
or alternate rallying points
(2) Control by a commander of an armored force unit during
attack is difficult He exercises such control as is p ossible
b y utilizing all practicable means of communication and
liaison and by making full use of his staff The commander
of the whole force is well forward until his troops are committed
to action He may remain with the force whose
mission is of decisive importance to the action or may go to a
position from which he can observe the action of both the
secondary and maneuvering forces He should at all times
be in close communication with his command post and his
reserve Control is always regained at rallying or alternate
rallying points
(3) Since mobility of all elements may result in considerable
dispersion the greatest possible latitude is given subordinates
to accomplish their missions in their own manner
in conformity with the general plan rather than on specific
instructions During the approach march formations are as
flexible as conditions of the terrain permit Each tank commander
selects his route and rate of march to conform to
the general formation and takes full advantage of cover
s Formations -Formations of units in the attack should
be simple and flexible in order that units may retain their
ability to maneuver Dispositions should permit control
mutual fire support and development of the maximum fire

power in the shortest time with least exposure to hostile fire
t Frontage and depth -The depth and frontage of the
initial combat formations depend primarily upon known
hostile composition and dispositions the terrain and distance
to the objective
( ) The main attack is delivered on the minimum frontage
necessary to overcome resistance to its advance consistent
with the number of tank units employed It is launched in
sufficient depth to insure sustained and successive striking
power
(2) Secondary attacks are characterized by lack of depth
limited objectives and wide zones of action The frontage
of any unit in the secondary attack is based in general upon
its principal weapon strength It varies with the mission or
missions and combat power of the unit the terrain the
amount of fire support available and the probable hostile
resistance that will be encountered
47 CONDUCT OF OFFENSE-a Offensive action -Offensive
situations that armored force units will participate in are
covered under subsequent paragraphs They may be classed
generally as :
( ) Meeting-engagements
(2) Attacks against enemy positions
(3) Exploitation of a success
(4) Pursuit
(5) Special operations
b Development for combat( ) In anticipation of offensive
combat an armored force unit is disposed with the reconnaissance
elements in contact or seeking contact with the
enemy the advance guard furnishing security en route the
combat elements in the main body in the order facilitating
their employment the light maintenance elements close up
in rear and the supply and administrative elements moving
well to 'the rear
(2) Development for offensive combat may be from the
march column direct with the minimum amount of coordination
or if the approach is made at night it will be made
from assembly positions (areas) Should the commander
decide that rapidity of action is essential to retain a tactical
advantage he may dispense with assembly positions decentralize
operations to combat units and issue orders to those
0
47 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
units to develop and attack Normally coordinated attacks
are organized and launched from assembly positions (See
fig 24 )
c Assembly positions (see fig 24) Under conditions
where contact is imminent especially at night and march
formations are no longer safe to continue the units go into
previously reconnoitered assembly positions Assignment of
units to assembly positions is based chiefly upon the cover
and concealment available ; the disposition of units upon their
probable employment ; and to facilitate their initial movement
from the assembly positions Movement into positions
is under protection of the advance guard Guides are provided
to lead units into their assembly positions Depending
upon the available cover positions may be widely separated
They should not be within the range of hostile light artillery
fire Movement into assembly positions is often made under
the cover of darkness Daylight positions will have to be
changed after dark if the command is to bivouac Subordinate
commanders assign assembly positions to the component
units of their command in accordance with the foregoing
principles
( ) While units are moving into their assembly positions
the commander prepares his orders and completes arrangements
for the execution of his scheme of maneuver including :
instructions for further reconnaissance ; arrangements for
coordinating the action of troops in the attack echelon with
that of the artillery combat aviation and other supporting
elements; assignment of artillery units to direct and general
support ; attachments to attacking troops ; establishment of
communications ; and any other necessary measures Before
he decides on his scheme of maneuver for an attack the
commander whenever practicable makes a personal •r econnaissance
If possible he should be accompanied by his immediate
subordinate commanders
(2) As each unit arrives in its assembly position elements
take up dispersed formations suitable to the available cover
and concealment and to facilitate movement in more than
one direction out of the position Measures are taken immediately
for security against both air and ground forces
Roads are cleared and exits reconnoitered Communication
is esablished without delay between command posts and
liaison with the next higher unit is maintained Radio com-

munication ceases in proximity to the enemy sance Reconnais- of routes over which the elements are to advance is initiated as soon as these routes are known
(3) Maintenance and supply echelons are brought up to their unit assembly positions Vehicles are refueled last minute inspections are made and necessary maintenance is
performed until the last moment Extra ammunition re- quired is issued Kitchen trucks may be brought up and
personnel fed while in the assembly position
(4) Commanders of troops in the attack echelon and commanders
of units designated to support them coordinate the action of their units Coordination of the plans for maneu- ver and plans of the fire of subordinate units is completed and attack orders are issued promptly
d Phases of attack -Normally the attack passes through several stages These stages are the approach march de- ployment for attack fire fight assault reorganization and pursuit Some of these phases may be omitted For exam- ple in a sudden meeting engagement units may have to deploy for the attack direct from the march formation and be launched in an assault without going through an approach march or engaging in a fire fight There must be a reorgani- zation of attacking units afterwards An attack may be followed by a pursuit
e Approach march -( ) Security -In the approach to the attack a force protects its front by the use of a covering de- tachment Flanks and rear are protected by the utilization of terrain the use of combat patrols tank destroyer weapons
supports and reserves Any element of the command oper- ating at such distance that the security provided by the higher commander is not sufficient must provide its own security groups All subordinate units are responsible for the local protection of their flanks (For details on security see sec III )
(2) Formations -The main body of a combat force moves out from the assembly position in approach march forma- tions at the prescribed distance in rear of the covering de- tachments which move by bounds The enemy situation and terrain determine the fgrmation It should be extended both laterally and in depth in anticipation of the attack and to afford protection of personnel and vehicles from hostile long range fire The formation should be such as to take
03
47
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
advantage of covered routes Smaller units maneuver in
their approach to take as much advantage of cover as the
rate of advance permits Formations may and should be
changed to meet terrain conditions (See FM 7-5 )
(3) Intermediate positions -The approach march continues
to the line of departure except where halts of brief
duration are made at predesignated intermediate positions
for the purpose of coordination or pending further reconnaissance
Units remain disposed insofar as practicable in the
same relative position as in the approach march with vehicles
dispersed under cover
f Deployment for attack -As soon as resistance is encountered
by covering detachments the leading waves take up
attack formations before coming under effective fire Deployment
for the attack generally takes place as the line of
departure is crossed If the objective is at a distance from
the line of departure approach march formations may be
continued by all or part of the attack echelon until subjected
to hostile fire
( ) Usually if attack formations are not taken as the line
of departure is crossed a partial deployment in anticipation
of the attack formation is made This is done to permit the
continued advance of the rear elements when the leading
waves assume the attack formation For example a company
in line of platoons may change to a wedge formation
(platoons in column)
(2) Within attacking platoons maximum extended intervals
and distances consistent with control are taken to
afford protection to personnel and vehicles and permit them
to reach their objective with minimum casualties Vehicles
are disposed so that they will not interfere with the fire or
maneuver of adjacent vehicles Suitable attack formations
of platoons or companies are the squads wedge or squads
echelon formations (See FM 7-5 )
(3) Security during the attack is provided by reconnaissance
elements and combat patrols Liaison is maintained
by connecting groups (See sec III )
(4) For details concerning the conduct of the attack see
chapters 5 7 2 and 3
g Fire fight The fire fight takes place when combat units
are deployed and the advance can no longer be continued
without engaging the enemy by fire The fire fight is the
0 4
TACTICS AND TEC4NIQUE
47
primary mission of the units in the secondary attack force
(support echelon) Maneuvering units engage the enemy
during their advance by fire and movement
h Assault -The assault is the final combined effort of the all combat units to overcome enemy resistance
( ) Generally the tank units supported by the maximum
fire of supporting elements launch their assault by a short
swift concerted attack to overrun the enemy It is made
upon the signal of the leader of each wave after the units
have deployed and advanced to a point from which the objective
is readily discernible and the hostile position and
direction of attack is fixed Normally the assault is launched
from 200 to 400 yards from the objective Tanks are driven
at speed delivering a maximum volume of fire from their
weapons as they close with the enemy and overrun the hostile
position Units of the secondary attack force whose fire is
masked are displaced forward
(2) Some medium tank units may be used in turret defiladed
positions to support the assault by fire These positions
should be on the flank of the assaulting wave so that
fire of the medium tanks may be maintained until the last
practicable moment
(3) After°overruning their objectives tank units are reorganized
as subsequently described
i Consolidation of positions -Consolidation of positions is
accomplished by infantry and tank destroyer units who hold the captured objective and cover the reorganization of the tank elements Antitank weapons artillery machine guns
and mortars are disposed in mutually supporting positions
to protect the consolidation and reorganization The coordination
of the forward displacement of all units is the
function of the force commander
j Reorganization -( ) After an attack whether successful
or not the commander must reorganize his command
preparatory to further operations This is accomplished by
units reorganizing at rallying points or at alternate rallying
points under the protection of other combat units If pursuit
or another mission has been ordered previously it proceeds
after the reorganization
(a) Depending upon the time available at these points the
tank unit commander makes any necessary reorganization of his unit ; directs the tank crews assisted by the mechanical
05
47
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
crews to make needed repairs ; supervises the repair and redistribution
of weapons where necessary ; checks and redistributes
ammunition ; and regains rapidly a state of readiness
for combat When required supply elements maybe brought
forward Upon the arrival of the supply elements tanks are
refueled and ammunition replaced First aid is rendered at
this time by members of the unit and by attached medical
personnel which usually arrives with the maintenance personnel
Walking wounded are directed to the most conveniently
located aid station
(b) Upon completion of the reorganization each tank unit
commander reports to his next superior the combat condition
of his unit As soon as known he issues instructions to his
commanders covering the future action of his unit with special
reference to the next objective the route the formation
special missions and the time to start
(2) If unable to reach the rallying point or if at any time
it becomes necessary to rapidly reform to renew the attack
or to meet an immediate hostile threat a tank unit is rallied
as prescribed in FM 7-5
k Continuation of attack -The direction and continuity
of the attack is of first importance Continuity of the attack
is mainained by timely movement and employment of reserves
and by rapid reorganization and continuation of the
attack on the next position or movement toward the next
objective after successful assault on a hostile position When
the hostile position is broken through reconnaissance elements
followed by tank units immediately move out and continue
the advance Continuous pressure must be kept on the
enemy in order that exploitation or pursuit may begin at the
earliest practicable moment
Pursuit -The situation determines to what extent pursuit
is carried out The attack order issued by the commander
informs subordinates whether or not to pursue If a pursuit
is ordered the elements to make the pursuit are designated
and the limit of pursuit is prescribed in the attack order
Upon reaching the limits of the pursuit elements are assembled
and conducted to the rallying or alternate rallying points
m Service park -( ) Except for the light maintenance
vehicle the maintenance sections do not accompany their
combat units in the approach march The unit motor officer
selects a position for the unit service park where maintenance
c0
TACTICS AND TE HNIQUE 47
elements assemble when combat units attack The service
park may be established at the assembly position intermediate
position or other suitable position in rear of the line of
departure where water and cover or concealment are available
as dictated by the situation The unit motor officer is
responsible for 'the operation and immediate defense of the
unit service park He follows the course of action of the
combat units by radio or other means so as to be able to meet
conditions promptly Unit maintenance officers direct the
work of their unit maintenance in the service park
(2) Light maintenance vehicles accompany their units as
far forward in the approach as practicable but not beyond
the line of departure When their units cross the line of
departure maintenance vehicles and motorcycles are assembled
at a predesignated place in the vicinity of a supporting
unit command post or at a battalion or regimental service
park
(3) After combat light maintenance vehicles motorcyclists
and heavier maintenance elements may be directed to
rejoin their units at the rallying or alternate rallying points
Maintenance is continued to the last practicable moment before
combat and is resumed at the first opportunity during or
after combat The location of vehicle casualties is reported
to the service park
n Medical unit and detachments -( ) The operations of
the medical unit and detachments are covered in detail in
FM 8- 0
(2) In general regimental aid stations are established in
the vicinity of the service park Battalion sections accompany
their combat units in the approach and establish battalion
aid stations in the vicinity of the battalion service park where
the light maintenance vehicles and motorcyclists are located
Litter bearers of units remain at their battalion aid stations
Litter bearers of infantry units follow closely behind the
infantry and artillery elements Company first aid men of
infantry and artillery elements accompany them into action
(3) The commander of the medical battalion establishes
collecting points in rear of the battalion aid stations and as
near to them as ambulances can be operated with reasonable
safety Provisions are made for collecting platoons to evacuate'the
wounded from the' aid stations to the collecting stations
where clearing companies evacuate them to the rear
07
47-48 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(4) After combat the battalion sections accompany the light
maintenance vehicles when they rejoin their units and establish
aid stations when and where needed
o Trains -The supply echelons are consolidated under the
command of the train commander G-4 (S-4 in smaller
units) directs the employment of the supply echelons in acccrdance
with the situation and plan of supply The train
commander is in charge of their movement and bivouac and
is responsible for reconnaissance of their routes and for their
security (See FM 7-50 )
∎ 48 MEETING ENGAGEMENT -a General -A meeting engagement
may result from uncertainty or obscurity in the
situation such as In the meeting of small units or when reconnaissance
is ineffective Again it may occur when each opponent
is cognizant of the other but both decide to attack
without delay to retain or gain some tactical advantage or to
gain a decisive terrain feature or because of a knowledge of
superiority over the other Except where armored units are
employed to rupture a position collision with hostile forces
will usually be in the nature of a meeting engagement
b Plans ( ) Preliminary planning Anticipatory planning
is essential to success in a meeting engagement Planning
starts with receipt of warning orders for the movement
All available data on the route or routes of march and terrain
of the zone of advance is obtained and information concerning
it disseminated to commanders The best available maps
are procured and distributed Aerial photographic reconnaissance
is used to supplement the maps Reconnaissance
strips and individual photographs are taken of critical points
and areas By study of these data and maps the commander
plans his march and disposes his subordinate units in various
columns so as best to develop for combat He determines the
critical points in the zone of advance and makes plans for
action against the enemy at those points He determines
points or areas where the enemy may be taken by surprise or
at a disadvantage and plans to force combat in such areas if
opportunity arises Plans are made flexible and troops are
disposed for control and to facilitate rapid entry into battle
Commanders of the main subdivisions of the command are
informed of these plans and given orders missions or tasks
for carrying them out
08 439995 -42-3
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
48
(2) Dispositions Armored units advance usually in multiple
columns covered by advance flank and rear guards as
necessary and by reconnaissance elements well to the front
Usually medium tank units may be attached to light armored
regiments for the movement Medium tank units should be
placed well forward in the columns so that they may be used
to counter hostile mechanized threats and may enter into
combat without passing through the light tank organizations
Infantry may be attached to each column Each column
must be given artillery Tank destroyer elements are usually
detailed to march with flank columns to protect against a
mechanized attack
(3) Scheme of maneuver -Direct frontal attacks are
avoided when practicable and are made only when the hostile
flanks are unassailable The envelopment or double envelopment
is the usual method of attack Tank units seek to
encircle the enemy and attack him from the rear The
advance guard or guards are used to seize vital terrain to
limit the hostile advance to the front while the tank units
move around the flanks Infantry may be used to reinforce
the advance guard or all or part of it used to follow up the
tank attack
c Action as "combat becomes imminent -As combat becomes
imminent the commander completes his plan of action
and gives final instructions for the operation
( ) Advance guard -Action of the advance guard is characterized
by speed and aggressiveness If Indications show
that the enemy is preparing to organize or is organizing a
defensive position the advance guard drives in the hostile
covering force and seeks to disrupt his defensive organization
If the advancing enemy is in a position unfavorable for our
attack the advance guard may fight a delaying action or
withdraw until the enemy has advanced to more favorable
ground for our attack However the advance guard must
not retire so far as to endanger or restrict the movement the of main body
(2) Artillery -(a) Artillery with advance guard -As contact
becomes imminent the artillery advances by leap frog- ging part of it always being in position to support the advance
guard action It opens long range fire on hostile columns and
09
48
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
interdicts routes of approach An artillery liaison officer
must be with the leading elements of the advance guard and
an artillery airplane furnished
(b) Artillery with main body -Artillery with the main
body is well forward so that it may quickly go into action
As contact becomes imminent the artillery prepares to reinforce
the advance guard to protect the flanks and to protect
the development of the main body When the situation is
obscure artillery advances by echelon part of it always being
in position to protect the column
(c) infantry -The Infantry may be used to support the
advance guards ; to seize and hold terrain to form a pivot for
maneuver It may seize assembly positions on the flanks
from which armored units launch their attacks It may be
held in reserve to follow the attacking echelons and assist in
the mopping up of the hostile forces
d Conduct of attack -( ) Control Control is chiefly
maintained by assigning a direction of attack and objective
In some cases a commander may be given a mission order
assigning him an objective and time of attack The force
commander may assign rallying points where he will regain
control Communication is chiefly by radio Liaison airplane
and messenger may be used
(2) Artillery Artillery gives close support in initial stages
of the attack by preparation fire and successive concentrations
and thereafter is used against resistances holding up
the attack Artillery observers are with forward units Artillery
interdicts routes of approach of enemy reinforcements
A part of it follows the attack closely so that it will be ready
to give close support in assisting in reducing small islands of
resistance holding up the attack
(3) Aviation -See paragraph 46
(4) Infantry -Infantry assists the attack by forming a
base of fire about which the tank units maneuver Where
unexpected hostile organized defenses are encountered and
cannot be avoided by tanks infantry is used to attack such
localities Infantry follows the tank echelon and consolidates
gains made
e Meeting engagement with unarmored troops -In a
meeting engagement with unarmored troops the attack is
pushed to a conclusion without delay If the hostile force
is known to be poorly disposed for defense the attack is
0
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
48-49
launched promptly and aggressively with little or no fire support
in order to afford the enemy no time to develop and
concentrate his defensive means Armored units attack on
a broad front against a flank to engage the greatest possible
number of enemy troops simultaneously and permit a maximum
use of shock action combined with fire power of vehicular
weapons After the attack has passed through the hostile
dispositions its direction may be reversed and the
assault repeated Each march column may be given a certain
task in this operation so attacks may be launched simultaneously
Flank attacks may not be practicable in which
case frontal attacks usually on a narrow front in great depth
are made direct from march column Against unarmored
troops small reserves are held out
f Meeting engagement with hostile armored units -In a
meeting engagement with hostile armored units maximum
use is made of terrain to canalize and restrict the enemy's
maneuver If the advance guard is opposed by weak forces
the reserve of the advance guard may be used at once to
turn this attack into the main attack The main attack
force is composed of tank units It maneuvers to attack the
enemy from the flank or rear It has as its objective the
destruction of hostile artillery communication and service
elements Attempt is made by feints to cause the enemy to
dislocate his main body or reserves and thus place himself
in a vulnerable position Medium tank units may be used in
the leading attack echelons against armored forces A large
reserve Its held out and is located so as to facilitate its
employment with either the main or secondary attack
49 ATTACK AGAINST HOSTILE FORTIFIED POSITIONS -a General
-In general armored units avoid attacking enemy defensive
positions If practicable the position is screened by
all or part of the support echelon while the remainder of the
force passes around a flank of the hostile defenses and proceeds
on its mission After passage of this force screening
elements assemble and follow unless they are required to
remain to protect the line of communication Higher commanders
detail motorized infantry units to relieve the armored
infantry when necessary When the hostile defenses
cannot be screened and passed by armored forces seek to
turn the enemy out of position by encirclement Or envelop49-
50
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
ment of one or both flanks An attack of a fortified position
by penetration is unusual for an armored force acting alone
and should be made only when other maneuver is impracticable
or a weak spot can be found in the hostile defenses In
penetrations in cooperation with other large units of the
combined arms the zone of the initial break-through is neutralized
or breached completely by other troops Armored
divisions then enter the breach and launch their attack as a
passage of lines
b Attack by envelopment -When one or both hostile flanks
are vulnerable single or double envelopment is made The
support echelon is used to make the holding or secondary
attack while the striking force envelops or encircles one or
both hostile flanks Direction and time of attack and line
of departure are given for the secondary attack The striking
force is given a direction of attack including an objective
or objectives or it may be given a mission order an objective
and route or routes of approach being assigned It may
attack simultaneously with the support echelon but usually
attacks later The striking force seeks to attack the enemy
from the rear and destroy his artillery reserves communications
and supply installations
I
c Attack by penetration -When an attack by penetration
is necessary the support echelon in conjunction with the
infantry artillery engineers and combat aviation neutralizes
or breaks through the front to be attacked by the tank units
The attack is launched on a narrow front and in great depth
The striking echelon moves rapidly forward through'the gap
created or makes a passage of the infantry lines and advances
through the neutralized zone After passing through the
hostile position some tank units move to the right and left and
attack the enemy from the rear Other units continue to the
rear and attack hostile artillery reserves communications
and supply installations The Infantry assists the tank units
in mopping up the hostile position and in widening or maintaining
the gap (See figs 3 4 and 5 )

b Scheme of maneuver in break-through -To effect a
break-through and exploit such an operation the higher
commander masses his break-through troops usually special
units supported by large groups of artillery and such engineers
chemical troops and GHQ reserve tank units as are
necessary behind that portion of the line to be penetrated
Armored divisions and motorized infantry or cavalry divisions

Combat aviation is detailed to assist break-through troops
and delay hostile reinforcements Other troops are detailed
to attack all along the hostile line to confuse the enemy as to
the place and direction of the attack and delay movement of
reserves to meet such attack A feint may be made at some
other portion of the line to draw hostile reserves away from
the contemplated zone of penetration

through This employment is unusual The combat commands
in such operation are used similarly to GHQ reserve
tank units as explained in chapters 2 and 3
d Exploitation of a break-through by armored units -( )
General -The general methods employed in passing through
a gap in the hostile line and in exploiting aa penetration are
the same However in the first case the gap will probably be
found unexpectedly and time for deliberate reconnaissance
and preparation of plans will not be available In such a case
objectives are assigned and mission or task orders issued
In the latter case definite deliberately planned orders are
given
(2) Missions and obfectives -Missions assigned to armored
units in exploitation will be to attack hostile positions from
the rear ; attack and destroy hostile reserves and artillery ;
disrupt hostile communications command posts and supply
installations ; and to seize and hold vital terrain features or
areas until the arrival of other troops
(3) Preliminary preparations -Preliminary preparations
for exploitation of a break-through include reconnaissance
for routes and sites ; planning of movement to initial positions
and preparation of plans for the attack ; arrangements for
coordination with other units particularly with motorized
infantry supporting artillery and combat aviation ; arrangements
for attachment of other troops such as additional
engineer units if needed chemical troops combat aviation ;
and arrangements for supply and maintenance during the
operation
(a) Reconnaissance -Reconnaissance is made to determine
assembly and intermediate positions and routes and
zones of advance Routes to the front line held by friendly
troops are reconnoitered and arrangements made for marking
and for guides It must be remembered that the armored
units may be several miles behind the line of departure and
forward areas will be filled with troops detailed for the
break-through Map and aerial reconnaissance of the zone
of advance must be made
(b) Coordination with other units -Arrangements are
made with the break-through troops for necessary passage
of line Plans of action are coordinated by conference with
commanders of following motorized infantry divisions Liaison
officers should be sent to the headquarters of the break-

through units that are in the zone of the armored force

unit moves deep into hostile territory additional fuel trucks
may be attached to units Empty trucks are assembled

sance units more closely than in other forms of attack Those
units detailed to attack to the right and left fan out as soon
as they emerge from the gap advance rapidly on their objectives
and after completion of their mission rally and proceed
on to the next objective Those units that are detailed
to more distant objectives move rapidly forward in columns
preceded by their reconnaissance units The support echelon
follows the striking echelon Control is exercised by assignment
of routes zones phase lines and objectives (See
fig 6 )
2 5 PURSUIT -a General -The pursuit is launched when
the enemy is decisively defeated A commander recognizes
success by the continued advance of his troops in a decisive
direction and the capture of critical objectives ; by the number
of captured prisoners and abandoned weapons ; by the
number of hostile dead ; by the diminution of hostile artillery
fire ; by the relaxation or cessation of hostile countermeasures ;
and from reports that the enemy is withdrawing
b Preparation for pursuit-When it is recognized that the
enemy is withdrawing the commander should immediately increase
pressure on the enemy to maintain continuity of the
attack He regroups his reserves and makes plans for encircling
and completing the destruction of the enemy He
organizes his command into a direct pressure and an encirdling
force A reorganization line usually a line of rallying
points is set from which to launch the pursuit
c Object of pursuit -The object of the pursuit is the
annihilation of the hostile forces Pursuit is pushed to the
utmost endurance of men and vehicles No opportunity must
be given to the enemy to reorganize his defense Direct pressure
is combined with an enveloping or encircling maneuver
to place troops across the enemy's line of retreat Every effort
must be made to prevent withdrawal of the enemy under
cover of darkness Units continue to advance after dark
d Direct pressure force -The function of the direct pressure
force is to keep continuous heavy pressure on the retreating
hostile force so that the enemy will not be able to disengage
any appreciable part of his troops and send them to
the rear or use them to delay the encircling force Pursuit
is launched without halting direct from a reorganization line
set by the commander when he plans the pursuit Reserves

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
are sent in to gain the hostile flank or rear and break through
his covering troops
e Encircling force -The encircling force seeks to place
itself across the enemy's line of retreat When practicable it
advances along roads parallel to the hostile line of retreat
and attempts to block the enemy at defiles and other critical
points When the encircling force is unable to outdistance
the enemy it attacks him in flank and delays him so that the
direct pressure force can attack and complete the destruction
If the encircling force is not able to move around a
flank it pushes through a gap in the hostile line and proceeds
on its mission
f Pursuit by armored forces in conjunction with other
arms -( ) General When operating with larger forces the
armored division is employed in the encircling maneuvers
around exterior hostile flanks or through a breach effected in
the hostile dispositions GHQ reserve tank units if available
are usually used with the direct pressure force when armored
divisions are present However some battalions may be
attached to the encircling force The action of GHQ reserve
tank units in pursuit is covered in chapters 2 and 3
(2) Terrain -Unsuitable terrain or secure flanks of the
enemy may limit pursuit operations to direct pressure initially
or may admit of only limited encircling maneuvers to
areas where the retreating columns can be checked until
overtaken and destroyed by troops which are following directly
Encircling forces sent to these areas are usually small consisting
primarily of infantry reinforced by reconnaissance
elements tanks artillery and engineers
(3) Cooperation with other troops Infantry engineers
artillery and chemical troops may be attached to an armored
force unit in an encircling movement Motorized divisions
may follow to consolidate gains made and to assist in the destruction
of the enemy Observation aviation reports on
positions of hostile columns Combat aviation attacks and
delays the hostile retreat ; thus giving the encircling force
time to place itself across the hostile line of retreat
(4) Conduct of the encircling force -(a) Reconnaissance
-Reconnaissance units operate on the flanks of the
retreating columns gain contact and report on the compositlon
and direction of movement -of hostile forces and execute
harassing missions
R
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE

(b) Armored units -Armored divisions usually advance in
parallel columns Reconnaissance elements of the armored
regiments precede the advance Engineers are attached each column to to assist in removal of road blocks and construc- tion of crossings Artillery is placed with the advance guard
or well forward In the main bodies The artillery must be prepared to occupy positions from which fire may be brought
to bear on any hostile threat Tank destroyer units are dis- posed In each column If the enemy has mechanized units attack by such units may be expected on the heads and near flank A medium tank unit therefore should be well forward
in the column However the outer flank must not be neglected
because hostile reinforcements may be sent in from
that direction
(c) Infantry --The Infantry with the encircling force fol- lows the armored units closely and takes over critical terrain gained by the tank units It holds these areas to halt or delay the retreating columns
(d) Control -Control is exercised by giving march objec- tives routes of advance boundaries phase lines intermediate objectives to be used as bases for reorganization and by com- munication principally by airplane radio and motor mes- senger
4 Pursuit by armored force acting alone-Q) General - An armored force unit acting alone pursues principally by encirclement applies its strength to hostile weaknesses strikes enemy personnel and materiel at or near the heads of the retreating columns and seeks to gain critical points or areas on the hostile route where the enemy can be halted and destroyed
(2) Direct pressure force -The support echelon is usually
employed as the direct pressure force It may have attached
to it GHQ reserve tank units if available or medium tank units from the striking force It pushes rapidly and aggres- sively forward keeping constant pressure on the hostile cov- ering forces Suitable missions for tank units with the direct pressure force include disorganization or destruction of hostile reserves supporting weapons observation posts and command and communication installations Such tank units are given zones or routes of advance and final objectives They ad- vance without regard to supporting fires using fire and move- ment within the unit They will usually after the initial

attack work forward in small groups by infiltration and attack
the enemy wherever found
(3) Encircling force -The striking echelon is usually employed
as the encircling force Its action and conduct is as
previously explained
SECTION V
THE DEFENSIVE
0 52 GENERAL -a Role -The primary role of armored
forces on the defensive is the tactical offensive Their usual
employment will be in the counterattack However armored
divisions may for short periods organize and occupy a defensive
position
b GHQ reserve tank units -On the defensive GHQ reserve
tank units are employed primarily in counterattacks Their
use on the defensive is covered in chapters 2 and 3
c Types of defensive operations in which armored units
may participate -The usual types of defensive operations in
which armored units participate either when acting alone or
in conjunction with other troops are :
( ) Defense of a position
(2) Withdrawal
(3) Delaying action
∎ 53 DEFENSE OF POSITION WHEN ACTING ALONE-a General
-(I) An armored force acting alone may be forced to
take up a defensive position temporarily because of superior
hostile forces or it may have been assigned a mission to seize
and hold a critical point such as a bridgehead or a vital area
pending arrival of other troops
(2) The support echelon occupies the defensive position
while the striking force is used primarily for counterattacks
Reconnaissance elements perform their usual mission of reconnaissance
and in addition may be used for counterreconnaisso
nce and security missions
(3) The defense seeks to act by surprise Every effort is
made to conceal the nature of the defense and location of the
main line of resistance Changes in the defensive arrangements
camouflage dummy works and skillful screening by
security detachments in advance of the battle position mislead
the enemy and induce him to adopt faulty dispositions
By causing the enemy to take unfavorable dispositions the
20
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE 53
reserves of the defense consisting primarily of tank units
may be able to strike him a fatal blow
(4) Defense must be mobile The front covered by the
infantry regiment of an armored division will be small
therefore dependence must be placed upon the effective use
of large tank units as mobile r eserves FM 7-40 gives frontages
for infantry in defense
b Selection of position -As the Infantry will occupy and
defend the main battle position selection of such position
will conform to procedures laid down in FM 7-40 Full utilization
of all natural obstacles must be made to restrict the
direction and scope of the hostile attack When practicable
flanks should rest on impassable obstacles When this practicable is not ground should be selected with a view to limiting
as much as possible any flank attack The position should
afford good observation and fields of fire while denying to the
enemy observation over approaches to the position from the
rear Frequently it may be located on reverse slopes where
an adequate field of fire can be obtained
c Distribution of troops -( ) Usually the front is not defended
in uniform density Key points of terrain are occupied
and arrangements made to cover intervening spaces and
flanks by fires and counterattack of reserves Key points are
usually those terrain features that afford good observation
into the defensive position or over the foreground
(2) Troops on the defense are distributed in depth This
distribution provides for-
(a) Security and the necessary time for manning the
defenses of the battle position
(b) Screening the battle position and keeping the enemy
in doubt as to its location
(c) Facilitating 'r--elansce on the flanks and in the rear as well as to the front
(d) Avoiding offering the enemy a vulnerable concentrated target
(e) Providing suitable positions for reserves
(3) Troops are distributed in-
(a) A reconnaissance echelon
(b) A security or counterreconnaissance echelon
(c) A combat echeloh
(d) Reserves

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
d Reconnaissance -The reconnaissance battalion performs
its reconnaissance missions in all directions It contacts the
enemy and gives information of his strength composition and
movements It withdraws through or around the defensive
position and assists in flank protection It must be ready to
move out on reconnaissance when the offensive is resumed
Observation aviation performs its usual reconnaissance
missions
e Security and counterreconnaissance -Security detachments
protect the battle position from surprise ground attack
and screen it from hostile observation and investigation
Engineers assisted by infantry establish defended road blocks
and demolitions along the principal routes leading toward
the position Strong patrols operate between the obstacles
When necessary to accomplish greater delay than can be
expected by small infantry detachments not provided with
antitank guns tanks and artillery may be used to defend such
road blocks Elements of the reconnaissance company may
be used to defend road blocks and for patrolling between such
road blocks Outposts are ordinarily established within
range of light artillery supporting the main line of resistance
When beyond this range some light artillery is usually attached
to the outpost Local outguards sent out by units on
the main line of resistance are posted within range of infantry
supporting weapons When the battle position is on a reverse
slope it is protected by combat outposts on the crest These
are either made a part of or are protected by the combat
outpost When attack by mechanized forces is expected a
strong natural obstacle in the immediate front is a requisite
The reconnaissance battalion reinforced if necessary by the
reconnaissance companies of the light armored regiments
tank destroyer units may be used to form a Counterreconnaissance
screen across the front It may be reinforced
and employed to delay the enemy to give time for the defense
to be organized
f Battle position -The Infantry organizes and defends
the battle position in accordance with the methods discussed
in FM 7-40 All the artillery tank destroyer units except
that detailed for defense of certain road blocks are-used to
support this position The striking force is used primarily as
a reserve therefore infantry units need not hold out large
reserves This procedure is the reverse of that used by infantry
in an infantry division In the armored division the
tanks furnish the reserve whereas in the infantry division
a large mobile reserve must be held out when a wide
front is occupied In cases where a wide front must be defended
the Infantry may hold out no reserves and may have
attached to it small tank units for local reserves Under
exceptional circumstances individual tanks may when the
battle position is unduly extended be placed in a turret defl-

Crews and weapons of disabled tanks may be dismounted and
used to reinforce the battle positions (See fig 7 )
g Reserves -( ) Composition and location -Reserves
consist primarily of the tank units Depending upon the
terrain and the extent of the battle position reserves are
placed in one or more positions They are located in covered
positions preferably beyond range of light artillery fire
and where they have good routes of approach to counterattack
positions Where both flanks are open the striking echelon

may be divided into two or more parts one of which will be
in position to strike hostile enveloping forces
(2) Counterattacks -Plans are made for counterattacking
the enemy from any direction Where flanks are secure the
counterattack will be made to restore the battle position
This attack does not stop at the main line of resistance but
continues on beyond to a limited objective to completely
disrupt the hostile attack When one or both flanks are
open to counterattacks plans are prepared not only against
hostile forces attacking in front but also against hostile envelopin
; or encircling forces The enemy may try to work
far around the flanks and attack from the rear Plans must

9 54 DEFENSE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER TROOPS -a General
-(l) When employed in defense with other large bodies
of troops armored force units may be used to-
(a) Counterattack an enemy who has succeeded in penetrating
the position and disrupt his attack
(b) Attack an enveloping or encircling force
(c) Attack a hostile force that has committed itself to an
attack but has not yet penetrated the battle position
(2) Seldom will an armored division when operating with
other forces be assigned to hold a sector of the defensive
line A portion of the tank units particularly medium tank
units may be used to augment the antitank defense by taking
up positions where they may ambush hostile tanks that have
penetrated the position Thq armored artillery may be used
to augment the artillery of the defense However if the
armored division is to perform a semi-independent mission
against the flanks of attacking hostile forces or is to block
an envelopment then it should retain its artillery The use
of GHQ reserve tank units in the defense is discussed in
chapters 2 and 3
b Counterattacks ( ) Positions -If the armored division
is to be used as a whole in the counterattack it should be
located well to the rear in a covered area out of light artillery
range The location should permit of easy access to any
contemplated sector of employment
(2) Plans -By reconnaissance avenues of possible hostile
attack are determined Plans are then made for counterattacking
against any probable place of hostile penetration
Routes from the reserve position to the attack positions are
reconnoitered and assigned to various units Tentative zones
of action and lines of departure are assigned All arrangements
are made for quickly moving to attack positions and
launching the counterattack without delay
(3) Objectives -Objectives in front of the main line of
resistance are assigned in order to break up a hostile attack
formation Where the direction of the hostile attack has been
determined but the full force of the attack has nbt reached
the main line of resistance the armored force attack might
be launched against the flank of such hostile attack
(4) Support echelon The support echelon usually follows
and consolidates the gains of the striking echelon as in
offensive operations
27
54-55
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(5) Artillery -Artillery supports the attack initially by
concentrations on hostile troops All artillery in the area
should be used to support the attack
(G) Engineers -Engineers prepare routes of approach for
the attacking tank units
(7) Reconnaissance units Reconnaissance units are
either retained in reserve or given reconnaissance screening
counterattack or flank protection missions
(8) Conduct of attack -The conduct of the attack is the
same as the offensive (see sec IV) except that after the
attack tank units withdraw to a previously designated area
behind the battle position unless the offensive is to be
immediately assumed
c Attack of an enveloping or encircling force -The attack
of a hostile enveloping or encircling force is similar to an
attack in a meeting engagement Against unarmored troops
the support echelon is used to block the hostile advance while
the striking force maneuvers to strike the enemy in the flank
or rear Against armored troops the support echelon supported
by a part of the striking force blocks the advance
while the remainder of the striking force maneuvers to
attack the hostile flank
d Attack against hostile force that has committed itself
to attack but has not yet penetrated battle position -This is
a defensive-offensive operation The commander of the
whole force may take up the defensive to require the enemy
to deploy and attack By using the armored force from concealed
positions on the flank or even by passing the armored
units through his own line in a certain area the commander
may strike the enemy in flank or rear The enemy should be
struck after he has made his dispositions and launched his
attack but before he has penetrated the battle position This
operation requires careful timing The striking echelon
leads the attack and may be followed by the support echelon
55 WITHDRAWAL FROM ACTION -a General -Tactical doctrine
covering withdrawal from action by armored force units
is contained in FM 00-5 Action of GHQ reserve tank units
in withdrawal is discussed in chapters 2 and 3
b Armored force units in withdrawal -An armored force
unit may participate in withdrawal either as part of a larger
force or when acting alone In withdrawal its use is prima-
28
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
55
rily offensive to delay or break up hostile attacks and by so
doing relieving pressure so that the withdrawal may be
accomplished without undue casualties Armored forces
except the armored infantry are seldom used during night
withdrawal Tank units are used during the day for counterattack
to assist other troops in holding out until night in
order that withdrawal may be made under cover of darkness
c Withdrawal when acting alone-( ) Daylight with- drawal -In daylight withdrawal It may be expected that a
series of delaying actions will be fought The large withdrawal of units in daylight is dangerous and many casualties
may be expected
(a) Scheme of maneuver -A rearward position is desig- nated on which troops will prepare for renewal of resistance or under the protection of which they may be assembled for
further retrograde movement A covering force consisting of a part of the striking force is used to assist in the disengagement
of the infantry The infantry is disengaged and moves to the rear Reconnaissance units assist in flank protection
(b) Rearward position -The rearward position and routes thereto should be thoroughly reconnoitered Its selection is based upon the natural protection it affords against attack of hostile troops It should have good routes leading to its rear
(c) Covering force-The covering force will consist pri- marily of tank units and should be strong in medium tanks A part of the artillery may be attached to the covering force Engineers may be attached for demolition purposes The purpose of the covering force is to slow down or halt the hos- tile attack and protect the rearward movement of other troops
(d) Conduct of withdrawal -Counterattacks are made by reserves to halt or slow down the hostile attack The cover- ing force takes a position from which it may block the hostile advance Small tank units may be moved into turret defilade positions in or in rear of the infantry lines to protect the infantry withdrawal Artillery supports the withdrawal by concentrations on hostile troop concentrations and interdic- tion of critical areas Engineers'destroy bridges and perform other demolitions that will delay the hostile attack Combat aviation assists in the withdrawal by attacking hostile troop

concentrations and reinforcements Trains are withdrawn
first Infantry units in front lines as they are relieved by
tank units move to the rear in small groups entruck and
move to the rearward position Artillery withdraws by
echelon Tank units supported by tank destroyer units fight
a delaying action to protect the withdrawal of the remainder
of the force Reconnaissance units protect the flanks and
if and when action is broken off by the main force keep
contact with the enemy Maximum resort is made to ambush
tactics and delay in intermediate positions
(2) Night withdrawal-Whenever practicable troops hold
out until night to make a withdrawal By counterattacking
before dark with tank units pressure may be relieved and
organization of the night withdrawal made easier Rearward
positions are selected routes reconnoitered and all necessary
plans made as prescribed for a daylight withdrawal The
covering force will consist of elements of infantry tank destroyer
and artillery and operates in accordance with doctrine
prescribed in FM 00-5 Reconnaissance units protect
the flanks and are used as an additional covering force The
reconnaissance companies of the armored (tank) regiments
together with tank destroyer units may be attached to the
reconnaissance battalion for this maneuver When the
covering screen is withdrawn the reconnaissance units close
across the zone and cover the withdrawal They contact and
maintain contact with hostile units Troops withdrawn to
the rearward position may organize that position or retire
under the protection of a rear guard It will be unusual to
assign tanks to such'a force
d Withdrawal when opposed by unarmored troops -When
opposed by unarmored troops in a withdrawal the striking
force attacks to disrupt hostile forces Other units disengaged
by the tank attack move to the rear The striking
echelon then moves to the rear followed by the reconnaissance
elements
e Withdrawal when acting with other large bodies o}
troops -( ) General -When operating with other large
bodies of troops armored units are used primarily In daylight
withdrawal The support echelon may be used as a covering
force The artillery may and usually will be used to augment
the artillery of the defense The tank units may
be used either as a unit or in two or more units for launching
30
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
55-56
counterattacks In some cases the armored division and in
large forces the armored corps may be used to make a wide
encircling movement to move behind the hostile lines to
attack the hostile rear and break up and disorganize the
hostile attack Conduct of such forces is the same as in the
offensive Armored force units reinforced by tank destroyer
elements will be particularly effective as a covering force
acting against hostile armored units
(2) Counterattacks -The primary use of armored force
units in the withdrawal in conjunction with larger bodies of
troops will be in the counterattack Such attacks may be
made by the entire striking force or any portion of it The
piecemeal employment of tank units is wrong ; they must be
used in large numbers in a coordinated effort When hostile
mechanized forces are expected medium tank units should
be assigned each attack force and used primarily to lead the
attack Counterattacks in withdrawal are usually limited
objective attacks made on a broad front to delay and disrupt
the hostile attack
(3) Scheme of maneuver -See paragraph 54
56 DELAYING ACTION -a General -Procedure governing
delaying action ii;' covered in FM 00-5 The purpose of
delaying action is to give the main force time to retire to
consolidate positions or time and space to deploy for offensive
action GHQ reserve tank units may be attached to motorized
infantry or cavalry divisions engaged on delaying missions
A portion or all of an armored division reinforced by
tank destroyer units may be used on delaying missions
When advancing hostile columns contain armored units armored
units should be used against them The methods
employed vary from use of small groups to defend road
blocks or temporary defense of a natural obstacle to methods
involving offensive action by tank units such as limited objective
attacks and ambush Armored force units may be
employed alone or in conjunction with other forces It may
delay in one or successive positions If acting alone delay
in successive positions will be normal terrain permitting
b Scheme of maneuver -In delaying action by armored
force units one combat command is used to occupy delaying
positions to check the hostile advancing columns while the
other echelon with engineers threaten or attack the hostile
3
56
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
flanks or rear Combat aviation is used to attack hostile
columns troop concentrations and artillery Reconnaissance
elements keep the columns under constant surveillance
When operating with larger forces against hostile armored
units tank units together with tank destroyer units are used
to protect the flanks of the troops on the delaying position
to limit penetrations and to deliver counterattacks
c Selection of position -Good -observation long-range
fields of fire covered routes of withdrawal and secure flanks
are desirable for a delaying position When opposed to hostile
armored troops a position covered by natural obstacles
is highly desirable Successive positions should be separated
by such distance that hostile artillery will be forced to displace
in order to fire effectively Infantry units may however
have to occupy intermediate positions for mutual
support
d Delaying action when acting alone -When operating
alone as a delaying force armored units may be required to
cover a broad front in order to delay the various hostile
columns It will usually operate in two or more groups
against the heads flanks and if practicable the rear of
hostile columns For such operations an armored division
utilizes its combat command groups consisting of tanks infantry
artillery tank destroyers engineers and reconnaissance
units Each combat command group will be given a
certain column or a zone to delay
( ) Delay of hostile unarmored units--In the delay of hostile
unarmored units infantry and engineers will usually be
used to block the advance of the hostile columns while tank
units attack the flank and rear of such columns Some engineers
and reconnaissance units should be attached to the
maneuvering force The tank attack as in withdrawal is
characterized by quick powerful blows to disorganize the
enemy
(2) Delay of hostile armored units -In the delay of hostile
armored units enemy effort is made to locate each delaying
position behind a formidable natural obstacle The infantry
supported by artillery and tank destroyer units occupies the
position Engineers place obstacles in front of the position
Tank units are held in reserve to protect the flanks and to
execute counterattacks These counterattacks are characterized
by rapid blows to disorganize the enemy attack They
32

may be launched before the enemy has reached our own front
lines They are usually followed by rapid withdrawal to a
reserve position
e Delaying action in conjunction with other troops ( )
Against unarmored troops -Against unarmored troops armored
units when acting in conjunction with other troops
are used as in d( ) above
(2) Against armored troops --When operating in conjunction
with other troops in delay against an enemy having
armored elements armored units are usually left in reserve
to be used to protect the flanks and to counterattack The
counterattack is usually conducted as in d(2) above However
armored divisions may be used to move around a flank
of the delaying position and attack the enemy in flank
f Withdrawal -Withdrawal in delaying action is accomplished
as previously described Withdrawal starts before
units become heavily engaged in order to avoid losses If the
delaying force does become heavily engaged every effort should
be made to hold out until dark for a night withdrawal
SECTION VI
SPECIAL OPERATIONS
• 57 GENERAL -The general procedure governing special
operations is contained in FM 00-5 Armored units participate
in special operations primarily by employment of offensive
action Such operations include attack or defense of a
river line attack in woods attack and defense of towns and
cities and to a limited extent night operations The fundamentals
of attack and defense discussed in sections IV and V
apply to these operations
• 58 NIGHT OPERATIONS a General -In general night
operations of armored units will consist of night marches
movement into position and defense Collision with hostile
tank units at night will be rare because of the protective
reconnaissance and security elements However in pursuit
armored units continue the advance to the limit of their
ability at night

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
armored forces may when the division occupies a defensive
position make a local night attack to gain information to
seize defiles or to secure ground from which tank units may
launch a daylight attack Again infantry may be used at
night to seize and hold vital terrain features on a flank to
protect advancing armored columns In some cases infantry
might even make an attack to throw a hostile column into
confusion Hostile tank bivouacs' or assemblies may provide
remunerative objectives for infantry night attack
c Reconnaissance units -Use of reconnaissance units is
covered in chapter 4
d Tank units -The use of tank units in night operations
will be limited to local defense except in delaying action and
pursuit Observation from a tank is poor at the best and in
a night attack they would be very much at the mercy of
hostile antitank guns at close range and subject to destruction
by gasoline grenades They may be used in defense from
covered positions with guns sighted on main avenues of
approach They are not used in night attack except against
a badly beaten enemy under favorable conditions of visibility
and terrain or in limited objective attacks over previously
reconnoitered ground
e Artillery -Artillery is used in night operations to support
an infantry attack It may be used to fire against hostile
troop concentrations and for interdiction Use of artillery
in defense and withdrawals has already been discussed
f Tank destroyer units -Tank destroyer units are used at
night to cover likely avenues of approach and support the
defense of infantry artillery and tank units
∎ 59 ATTACK AGAINST RIVER LINE ---a General -Procedure
in attacks against a river line is covered in FM 00-5
Armored units may take part in such operations as part of a
large force or may when acting alone find it necessary to
force a river crossing (see eh 9 for combat command groupings)
GHQ reserve tank units must be reinforced by other
troops particularly engineers when the necessity for crossing
of unfordable streams can be foreseen Armored divisions
carry some bridging equipment but must be reinforced by
additional engineer troops when wide rivers are to be crossed
or crossings are to be made at several points simultaneously
b Types of action -Operations in the attack of a river

line may be classed as hasty crossings of small streams streams or large where bridges can be seized intact and forced cross- ings of large streams
c Surprise - Surprise in a river crossing is as essential as in any other operation Every effort must be made to deceive the enemy as to the actual point or points of crossing so he w ll not be able to mass his defensive means against the
operations Frequently feints are made at two or more points
while the actual crossing is made at another point The first troops usually cross just before daylight Smoke may be used to coi:coal Lhe crossing or used at the place where feints are made
d Security-Air superiority is essential in forcing a cross- ing of large strearns Antiaircraft artillery protects the bridging operations
r
e Reconnaissance -Prior to any operation all available data are assembled concerning streams to be crossed This includes width depth swiftness of current condition of bot- tom and banks fordability location of fords and bridges observation on each side of the stream and natural defen- sive strength of positions on hostile side Preparations are then made to provide the necessary units and materiels to cross the streams Engineers and tank destroyer units are attached Extra bridging equipment may be necessary All preparations praci~cable are made in order that a rapid crossing may be made
f Hasty crossings -( ) General -This type of crossing will occur frequently in pursuit exploitation and enveloping
movements Minor hostile resistance may be encountered or the enemy may be prepared to give deliberate resistance to crossing Bridges will usually be found destroyed and fords mined or damaged Engineers protected by infantry and tank destroyer units must be prepared to give prompt assist- ance in repairing or improvising crossings and in removal of obstructions and mines Advance units must act with
boldness and energy to seize bridges before the enemy is able to damage them
(2) Fordable streams-(a) Streams fordable for great
distance-Reconnaissance elements endeavor to locate un- defended or lightly defended crossing points They seize such points and hold them until arrival of other troops The attacking unit may cross on a broad front Part of the unit

by either firing from vehicles in covered positions or by using
weapons in dismounted positions cover the crossing by fire
while other vehicles are pushed rapidly across the stream and
attack the enemy from the rear Smoke if available is used
to screen hostile weapons and observation points Artillery
when present supports by concentrations on hostile defenders
and by counterbattery fire Medium tank units may be used
to support the crossing When the enemy has organized a
defense on the opposite bank the Infantry with tank destroyers
and engineers are used to effect the crossing (See
FM 7-40 )
(b) Stream fordable at only few points -In this case fire
is brought on the hostile defenders as previously described
Dismounted men infantry and engineers or a portion of the
crew of the vehicles are used as a dismounted maneuvering
element to move across up or down stream from the hostile
defensive position and attack from the flank or rear to destroy
or neutralize antitank weapons These men are armed with
personal weapons and vehicular weapons such as caliber 30
machine guns Armament includes subcaliber machine guns
and grenades In attacking a defended stream the support
echelon supported by all the artillery tank destroyer and
engineers forces the crossing The bulk of the tanks are
kept in covered areas prepared to move across when the crossing
has been effected
g Crossing of unfordable streams by armored unit acting
alone-(I) General-In general armored units smaller than
a division unless reinforced by engineers rarely attempt to
force a river crossing when acting alone Armored divisions
and smaller armored units move forward rapidly and seize
the necessary crossings and bridgehead on the enemy's side
of the river Parachute troops may be used to seize bridges
initially They are rapidly relieved by armored troops If
it is impossible to seize a bridge intact armored units move
quickly to weakly or undefended portions of the river line and
effect a crossing Action is rapid and bold Usually limited
time will be available for detailed reconnaissance Anticipatory
planning is essential to the success of the operation
Rapid communication and exploitation of local successes are
also essential Crossings may be made either during the day
or at night
(2) Plans -Plans are made before forward movement is

started to force a crossing in case the bridgehead desired
cannot be secured
(a) Scheme of maneuver -The scheme of maneuver is as
described in FM 00-5 After the Infantry has secured the
opposite bank and the bridge site from hostile small arms
fire some artillery tank destroyer and light tank units will
be ferried across The engineers build the bridge for the
remainder of the unit to cross Air superiority must be obtained
in daytime except in surprise crossings and antiaircraft
protection is furnished to troops building the bridge
(b) Infantry -The Infantry crosses in assault boats initially
Assigned objectives are seized and defensive positions
to secure the bridgehead are occupied Preparations are made
to break up hostile counterattacks Antitank guns and tank
destroyer element must be ferried across in the leading waves
(c) Artillery -All the artillery supports the attack initially
by concentrations on hostile positions counterbattery and
interdiction
(d) Tank destroyer -Tank destroyer elements are ferried
across early in the operation to assist the Infantry in antitank
defense The tank destroyer battalion crosses as soon as the
bridge is constructed and before tank units
(e) Engineers -Engineers with the reconnaissance units
reconnoiter the bridge sites and construct the bridges The
bridge company must be well forward in the column in the approach
so that assault boats will be available to the Infantry
at once and ponton equipment available for starting bridge
construction and for ferrying when needed The engineers
operate the assault boats and construct the bridge
(f) Reconnaissance elements -If hostile resistance is
slight reconnaissance units are crossed behind the Infantry
and continue on reconnaissance If hostile resistance is
heavy reconnaissance units are crossed after the tank units
(g) Tank units -Tank units are crossed as soon as the
bridge is constructed and follow the reconnaissance units
Artillery may be crossed with tank units
(h) Trains are crossed after all other troops and only when
the bridgehead is secure
(i) Time of attack -In this action time is essential Surprise
is essential and is obtained by secrecy deception and
speed of action The crossing Is forced at the earliest time
that preparations can be made A bridgehead must be ob-

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
tained during daylight hours of the day the attack is launched
It Attack of river line by armored forces in conjunction
with other troops -(l) General-When operating with other
troops in forcing a river crossing armored units are usually
held well to the rear in covered positions until other troops
have secured the bridgehead However armored divisions
may be used to effect a surprise crossing as previously described
and attack the enemy from the rear The armored
artillery may be used to reinforce the artillery of the bridgehead
troops It must however be ready to move forward
with the division
(2) Plans -When armored forces are to cross after the
bridgehead has been established plans are made and tentative
objectives are set so that it may best be employed to
exploit the crossing Plans must be flexible to take advantage
of the enemy situation Assembly positions of such armored
forces are selected with a view to rapid movement to any
point where a successful crossing has been made
∎ 60 DEFENSE of A RIVER LINE -a General The general
procedure for defense of river lines is covered in FM 00-5
A river is often used as an obstacle in front of a defensive
or delaying position It may be used as an aid in defensiveoffensive
action
b General scheme for defense of river line -Usually a river
line is not held in strength as a defensive position Units
are assigned such wide sectors that strong defense along the
river bank is impracticable The entire river line is covered
by patrols stationed to give warning of an attack Certain
favorable crossing points may be held by strong detachments
The bulk of the force is held in one or more reserve positions
ready to move to defend any threatened point of crossing or
to counterattack any hostile forces that have crossed
c Employment of armored forces in defense of river lines -
In defense of a river line armored units are most effectively
used as a powerful mobile reserve to attack hostile units that
have succeeded in crossing the river Both GHQ reserve
tank battalions and armored divisions may be used for this
purpose GHQ reserve tank units will seldom defend a river
line alone Armored divisions may defend a river line in
conjunction with other troops either being employed as a
reserve or to hold a sector on the river or they may defend
38
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
a river line alone pending the arrival of other troops
d Employment as reserve of a larger force in defense of a
river line ti) GHQ reserve tank units -In defense of a river
line GHQ reserve tank units are habitually employed in
reserve They may be attached by battalion unit to infantry
or cavalry divisions for operation with the reserves of such
units They are seldom employed in units smaller than a
battalion
(2) Armored divisions -Arrpored divisions employed reserve as a of larger units may be employed as a whole or used in two or more combat command groups each consisting
of reconnaissance light and medium tanks artillery tank
destroyer infantry and engineer units The most effective
use will be to counterattack the main enemy forces while they
are in the midst of crossing or before they have had time
to organize or consolidate after crossing The division should
be kept Intact when the road net and other conditions permit
(3) Position of reserves -The road net and condition of cross-country approaches as well as cover concealment and the tactical situation determine the position of armored
units in reserve In general reserve positions must fulfill the same conditions as those in the defense of a position They must facilitate speedy entrance into combat in any planned
area of operation GHQ reserve tank units usually are held near the general reserve of the unit to which they are
attached
(4) Plans -Procedure in planning for the use of the reserve
in defense of a river line is the same as in the defense of a position After receiving the plan of the sector commander
in whose sector he is operating the commander of an armored
unit by detailed reconnaissance and conference with unit
commanders in whose subsector he may operate makes plans
to meet all possible action by the enemy As in defense de- tailed plans are made for counterattacks and full coordina- tion of effort and a plan of supporting fires is made in cooperation
with other ground unit commanders When the armored
unit' is located in two or more groups situated to support the defense of different subsectors plans are made for the
speedy movement of such reserves to support the movement of any one unit (See fig )

tact with the hostile force on the enemy side of the river
(6) Artillery -The artillery should be left with the armored
units to be employed by them in the counterattack When
the armored division is divided into two or more combat
command groups each may require some artillery
(7) Engineers -Engineers are employed to prepare routes
of approach and some are attached to each group in reserve
(8) Infantry -Infantry is employed as indicated in FM
7-40 The armored infantry should remain with the armored
division and should not be used as a separate reserve for
other units A part of it may be attached to armored regiments
detailed in separate reserve locations •
(9) Tanks -Light and medium tank units are used in the
counterattack As the enemy will ferry antitank guns across
early medium tank units should be used in the leading waves
of the attack When attack is made to reduce a bridgehead
hostile tanks may be encountered The fundamentals of
tank versus tank combat then apply (See par 43 )
( 0) Control -Prior to an attack communication is primarily
by messenger Telephone may be used between larger
units In attack radio is the principal means of communication
Control is exercised as in the counterattack
( ) Conduct of attack -The attack is conducted as a
counterattack in defense of a position When the attacking
force reaches Its objective usually the river bank where bridging
work is in progress or a bridge has been built the tanks
attack the enemy byy fire while infantry and engineers destroy
the bridge Tank units are then withdrawn to a reserve
position
( 2) Time of attack -The attack is preferably launched
Before the enemy has established a bridgehead and started
bridging operations It is launched as soon as the location
of the hostile main effort is determined
e Employment in defensive-o ffensive -In defensive-offensive
operations attempt is made to strike the enemy while
he is astride the river Some armored units may cross the
river and attack the enemy in rear or flank Action will be
similar to a meeting engagement in the offensive Other
units may counterattack troops already crossed

the hostile side of the river ; local patrols along the bank ;
local defense elements at most favorable points of crossing ;
local reserves in defensive sectors ; and a large general reserve
No attempt is made to hold the river line in strength
at any one point
(2) Reconnaissance elements -Reconnaissance elements
operating against advancing hostile forces delay the enemy
and report his movements Air observation is used to the
maximum When forced across the river reconnaissance
elements assist in patrolling the river line and protecting
the flanks
(3) Engineers -Engineers prepare bridges for destruction
and routes of approach for tank units
(4) infantry -Infantry patrols the river line and furnishes
local reserves at the most likely crossing points
(5) Tanks -Tank units are held in reserve for counterattack
use
(6) Artillery -Some of the artillery supports the Infantry
but the bulk is held in mobile reserve prepared to support the
striking echelon
(7) Destruction of fords and bridges -Fords and bridges
are prepared for destruction Those not to be used by withdrawing
reconnaissance and delaying elements are destroyed
Others are prepared for destruction These points are defended
by fire of automatic weapons and tank destroyer elements
When reconnaissance units have withdrawn the
bridge or ford is destroyed An officer must be stationed at
the bridge or ford prepared to instantly destroy it if it is in
danger of falling into hostile hands This officer must act
upon his own initiative and not wait for instructions from
higher authority
(8) Conduct of defense -The defense is conducted as in the
defense of a position
6 COMBAT IN TowNs --a General -In general armored
vehicles are not suitable for combat in towns particularly
large towns Towns offer concealment to large forces observation
is limited fire effect is reduced and combat deteriorates
to that of small groups Such localities enable the
enemy to effectively use antitank weapons barricades
demolitions and mines
b Attack of a town -Armored units if practicable avoid
42
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
6 -22
attacking towns If attack must be made the town circled A is en- direct frontal attack is resorted to only when
encirclement is impossible
( ) Attack by encirclement -The support echelon with part of the artillery makes the direct assault on the town while tank units move around one or both flanks to cut off the forces in the town from reinforcements and isolate it from hostile
supporting forces • When no infantry is present part of the tank units supported by machine gun elements is used for the main attack
(2) Frontal attack -This form of attack is resorted to only as a last resort or when the locality can be surprised The Infantry supported by all the artillery makes the attack Tank destroyer and tank units will usually be used only to repel counterattacks after the town has been taken When
no Infantry is available elements of the reconnaissance and
battalion headquarters companies may be used in the assault while tank and artillery units cover the advance by fire
(See FM 7-5 )
c Defense of town -In defense of a town infantry supported
by artillery and tank destroyer units are used to de- fend the town itself while tank units are held in reserve to attack enveloping forces When a tank unit is acting alone it uses its mobility- to attack the enemy before he reaches the
outskirts (See FM 7-40 )
62 COMBAT IN WooDs --a General -The effect of woods
upon movement of tanks has been previously discussed
Woods may be both a help and a hindrance to armored units
in combat They are a help in that they afford cover and concealment However observation in woods is limited ; large closely spaced trees slow down or prevent movement
except on roads or paths Control in woods is difficult direction
is easily lost and mixing of units often results Tracts
of heavy woods tend to canalize an attack Woods facilitate
enemy antimechanized defense The concealment of antitank
guns is easy Demolitions barricades and mines can
be used to good effect
b Attack on woods-( ) Hostile defenses -Owing to the
excellent artillery target presented by the edge of a woods
defensive works are either placed some distance in front of or
back from the edge The position will depend largely on the field of fire
43
62-64
ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
(2) Scheme of maneuver -Tank units seek to avoid heavy
woods Smoke is used to blind observation and antitank
guns in the front edges and flanks Where woods must
be
attacked frontally the Infantry when available supported
by heavy artillery fire makes the attack When infantry is
not available tank units supported by artillery tank destroyers
mortars and other tank units make the attack
(3) Conduct of attack -When tanks reach their objectives
they must not halt in the edge of woods Directions may be
given and tanks push on through the woods In heavy
woods when trails only can be used antitank mines and antitank
guns may and probably will be encountered and ambush
may be expected After the initial assault and when the distance
through the woods is great reconnaissance units may
precede the tanks When emerging from woods tanks must
be deployed
c Defense of woods-The support echelon defends woods
as outlined heretofore for the defense Tank units are held
in reserve to counterattack hostile attacking forces Tanks
may be concealed in woods through which they may move
by previously reconnoitered routes to attack a hostile force
in flank This maneuver is especially effective in counterattacking
hostile tanks that seek to avoid heavy woods
0 63 ATTACKS IN MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY -Operations in
mountainous terrain usually limit tanks to defiles which are
easily defended by antitank guns and antitank mines Infantry
and engineers supported by artillery clear the defiles
and the tanks attack the enemy after debouching from the
passes Air superiority is a requisite to moving through
mountain passes during daylight hours (See FM 3 - 5 )
2 64 TANK VERSUS TANK COMBAT -a General ( ) Large
tank units and armored divisions are highly effective means
to counter hostile mechanized forces They are used in an
offensive manner in large numbers in execution of definite
missions The employment of these units on such missions
must be closely coordinated with and supported by all other
available antimechanized means including tank destroyer
units and combat aviation Tanks must not be used as stationary
pill boxes
(2) When tanks are assigned a mission that does not con-
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE 64
template the engagement of hostile tanks they should not be
diverted from such mission except-
(a) When forced to engage hostile tanks as a matter of
self-preservation
(b) When it is apparent that the hostile attacks will
seriously disrupt the operations of other troops
(3) When hostile tanks are superior in armor and armament
combat is avoided if practicable When these conditions
exist effort is made to draw the enemy into our own
mine fields or into areas covered by friendly tank destroyer
weapons
(4) Maneuvers should be planned and executed so as to
destroy the enemy in detail Flank attacks in close formations
to bring a great volume of fire on successive waves supported
by tank destroyer elements are most effective Speed
is used to maneuver to a deflladed or covered position from
which accurate fire from a halted tank may be brought to
bear on hostile tanks When the hostile armament outranges
that of our own closing within range of the enemy guns is
avoided unless effective fire can be brought to bear from
defilade Attack with a view to collision is avoided unless
out of ammunition or almost out of gasoline Tanks so used
will probably be sacrificed Under exceptional circumstances
when other means are not available and time is a
deciding factor a tank may be used to block a defile
(5) Medium tank units owing to their superior armor and
armament are used to lead attacks against hostile mechanized
units They are supported by tank destroyer units
(6) Tank crews must be carefully trained in-
(a) Recognition of hostile and friendly tanks by silhouette
(b) Characteristics and capabilities of hostile tanks pertaining
to armor armament and speed
(c) Vulnerable parts of hostile tanks upon which fire will
be effective
(d) Range at which our weapons are effective against
hostile vehicles
(e) Hostile methods of tank employment
(f) Methods of combating hostile tanks such as use of
speed defilade and cover and ambush
(g) Cooperation with tank destroyer elements
b Offensive action -( ) Tank units on the offensive will
be used to deliberately attack hostile mechanized forces
45
64 ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
Tank versus tank combat may result from contact with hostile
attacking units Tanks are most vulnerable to hostile
armored fighting vehicles when actively engaged with other
elements of the enemy and when undergoing reorganization
(2) In planning his action a tank unit commander must
consider the probability of hostile mechanized attack and
terrain where such attacks are possible Plans are made for
countering hostile mechanized attack and definite orders
given to units as to action in case of attack Flanks and rear
are particuiarly vulnerable Medium tank units and tank
destroyers when available are used not only to lead the
attack but also some units are detailed to protect the flanks
and rear Tank destroyer units also protect the flank and
rear When hostile mechanized attack is expected a large
reserve consisting prinrarlly of medium tank and tank destroyer
units should be held out This reserve must foilow
the attack by such routes as to be readily available to counter
hostile tanks
c Defense -( ) In the defensive tank units supplement
the employment of tank destroyer units in the antitank
defense They are used in large nunibers to counterattack
hostile mechanized elements that have penetrated the battle
position and to attack hostile forces in their assembly positions
or when they have launched the r attack but have not
yet reached the battle position
(2) The counterattack of tank units against hostile tanks
must be supported by fire of all available tank destroyer
weapons and artillery Support of bombardment aviation is
desirable and should especially be used when the attack is
made against hostile units that have not yet reached our
lines After contact has been made with hostile tanks fire
of large caliber supporting weapons will be limited because
of the danger of hitting friendly tanks
(3) Counterattacks are planned as described in section V
In counterattack against mechanized forces all available
cover is used to c ppi-oach those forces from the flank If
practicable ambush may be prepared Tank destroyer units
are espec ally suitable for use in ambush When used from
ambush tanks halt in covered or defiladed positions for
short periods to fire their heavy weapons
(4) Hostile tanks that break through the defensive position
must be attacked immediately by tank destroyer and
46
TACTICS AND TECHNIQUE
6 4-65
tank units They should not be allowed to penetrate deeply
into a position before counteraction is taken GHQ reserve
tank battalions supported by tank destroyers are suitable
for such missions The battalion will be given a certain
defined sector to cover It will in turn divide this into company
sectors The battalion as a whole is located in a central
reserve position from which it or any of its elements may
move quickly to any part of the sector to search for and
destroy hostile tanks As soon as an element has completed
its mission it returns to the central reserve position In this
way the greater part of the battalion will be ready for other
missions Liaison officers with the headquarters of the troops
holding the sector and battalion reconnaissance elements are
used to report locations of hostile tanks
SECTION VII
MARCHES
6 5 GENERAL -a FM 7-50 covers technique of marches
both administrative and tactical
b The armored division habitually marches in multiple
columns disposed so as to readily enter combat in accordance
with the plan of the commander It is preceded by
the reconnaissance battalion the reconnaissance companies
of the tank regiments and advance guards for each column
Columns are formed so that entry into bivouac assembly
areas or combat may be made with the least practicable
delay and confusion Doubling of units on the road must
be avoided
c The number and composition of columns varies with the
road net the tactical situation and the plan for employment
The columns are composed of combat command groups both
tanks and infantry artillery engineer and tank destroyer ;
light tanks usually lead Infantry with tank destroyer units
are placed in the lead ; during the hours of darkness ; when
the situation is obscure ; when the plan of employment
contemplates commitment of the infantry prior to the tanks ;
and when the employment of the tanks cannot reasonably
be foreseen Artillery is placed well forward in each column
Tank destroyer elements are disposed to protect the and flank rear Depending upon the condition of routes and the necessity for clearing hostile road blocks engineers are
47

ARMORED FORCE FIELD MANUAL
attached to each column including a detachment with the
advance guard Infantry should be attached to the advance
guard when their use in reducing road blocks can be foreseen
d Control is maintained by designating march objectives ;
zones or routes of advance ; phase lines to be passed at designated
times or when ordered ; and by prescribing rates
of march
e Air superiority is a requisite for a successful daylight
march When air attacks are expected increased distance
must be taken between elements and in some cases advance
is made cross-country in small groups
f In the presence of hostile aviation and when secrecy
is vital night marches are habitual The infantry with
tank destroyer unit usually leads the march to secure assembly
areas for the division
66 FORMATION a (See • ch 7 ) The armored division
may march in regimental columns or it may be formed
into combat command groupings with tank battalions as the
nucleus of each group Each such group may consist of light
tanks medium tanks artillery tank destroyers engineers
and infantry Within each column the light tanks usually
lead The artillery is placed well forward usually following
the light battalion
b Unit trains with the columns are usually grouped and
follow in rear of the column They may however be with
their units The division trains march on a route away
from the exposed flank or in the center column where they
will have the maximum protection afforded by the combat
echelons
