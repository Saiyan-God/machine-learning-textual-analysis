MONTREAL – The city of Montreal is experimenting with a new way to clear snow off the streets.

City officials want to implement a new technology to make snow-removal more efficient and less expensive.

The $6.7 million plan will add GPS and electronic readers to around 200 snow clearing vehicles so officials can measure exactly how long it takes to clear a street, as well as judge how much snow is removed.

The new system will also install measuring devices on dump trucks belonging to subcontractors that work for the city to record their weight, capacity and ownership.

When these trucks arrive at the dump sites, operators will be able to calculate how much snow the truck is carrying and where it comes from.

Notices will also be set up through social media so residents know in advance when plows are rolling down their streets.

In the past, Montreal’s snow-clearing system has long been criticized for being expensive and inefficient.

This is because each of the 19 boroughs was responsible for its own operations and the city had no control over which boroughs fell behind in their snow removal.

There are nine boroughs slated to be the first to implement the new snow-clearing technology.

These are Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, the Sud-Ouest, Plateau–Mont-Royal, Rosemont–La-Petite-Patrie, Ahuntsic–Cartierville, Rivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles, Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Villeray–St-Michel–Parc-Extension and Ville-Marie.

The city is expected to implement the new system in the fall of 2014.
