Hatchbacks are an optimal choice for those looking for the extra storage of an SUV, but the affordability, driving experience and fuel economy of a sedan. However, unlike sedans, which feature separate cabins for passengers and cargo, hatchbacks are designed with a combined passenger and cargo cabin, allowing for a much more efficient use of the interior space.

They also offer a more sedan-like driving experience and better fuel economy as compared to most SUVs thanks to their lower centre of gravity and relatively compact architecture. While the demand for SUVs continues to rise, their price often carries a premium relative to hatchbacks, making the latter a fitting choice for drivers who desire the best of both worlds.

We’ve featured some of our favourite offers this week on hatchbacks. If you don’t find an offer that suits you, be sure to check out the new Globe Drive Build and Price Tool to see the latest incentives and discounts on any new car, truck or SUV.
